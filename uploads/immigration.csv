In a hearing, U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he would dismiss the suit and issue a final written opinion in the coming days. The updated docket for the case showed that Oregon’s move to dismiss the case was granted.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield welcomed the move.

“The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,” he said in an emailed statement. “Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can’t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Kasubhai scheduled the hearing after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dated Saturday, the same day federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, which has seen widespread protests over increased immigration enforcement and the previous killing of Renee Good by an immigration officer.

In her letter, Bondi asked the Democratic governor to support immigration officers and shared three “simple steps” to “help bring back law and order” — including by giving the Justice Department the ability to “access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota’s voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

Bondi also asked for the state’s records of its Medicaid and food assistance programs, and for the repeal of sanctuary policies that limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Officials in many states have said turning over such information would violate both state and federal privacy laws.

The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data. Last week a federal judge in Georgia dismissed such a suit after ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city, and earlier this month a federal judge in California dismissed a suit there after finding the government’s request was “unprecedented and illegal.”

The department has said it needs to access detailed voter data to ensure election officials are following federal election laws. Election officials have disputed that and raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.

In a July letter, the department asked Oregon for an electronic copy of its statewide registration list and details on the steps it has taken to remove ineligible voters, court filings show. It sent another letter in August saying it needed the voter list to assess compliance with federal law, and that the list must include information such as full names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers.

Oregon officials responded in August that the department lacked the authority to request the list and offered to provide the publicly available list, court filings show. The department argued it has the authority to request the data under multiple federal laws and is complying with privacy laws.

Kasubhai called for the Monday hearing in Oregon’s lawsuit so that attorneys on both sides could provide additional arguments on how Bondi’s letter was relevant in interpreting the “basis and purpose” of the department’s request for voter data.

The department argued it had authority under the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to request voter records, as the law says such records are to be made available to the U.S. Attorney General upon a demand in writing that states the basis and purpose of the request. Yet Kasubhai said the department’s August letter did not satisfy the law’s requirement for stating a basis and purpose when requesting voter records. He added that he read the congressional record of the time when the law was passed, and found it was “unequivocal” on the release of records being associated with investigations involving discrimination in elections.

The Justice Department’s outreach has raised alarm among some election officials because the agency doesn’t have the constitutional authority to run elections. That power is granted to states and Congress. Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260126-Oregon-voting-file-aa-1105-71814d.jpg",N,,2026-01-27 14:59:41.721303

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, putting Congress back on the brink of another spending fight.

What we know:

A House-passed bill would fund six federal agencies, including DHS, but the weekend’s events in Minneapolis have shifted the debate.

The measure now sits in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have vowed to block DHS funding, arguing the agency’s immigration enforcement has grown out of control.

Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said her constituents have overwhelmingly urged her to oppose funding for the department.

""That's overwhelmingly what my constituents have asked me to do. Do not go to fund ICE. What I think most Americans would rather have me support them and stand up to the Trump administration. All we're asking the Republicans to do is pull out the funding for DHS and let's work on fixing the problems in it and let's work on adding things that will rein in ICE. I want money to go back to local law enforcement,"" Duckworth said.

Seven Democrats would need to support the bill to overcome a filibuster and advance it. Republicans have not said whether they are open to negotiations or cuts to DHS funding to secure Democratic votes.

Some Democrats are taking a harder line, pledging to block any action until DHS Secretary Kristi Noem resigns.

What's next:

Since the bill funds only part of the government, a lapse would not trigger a full shutdown.

The rally took place along Second Avenue outside the federal building as a spending bill moves through the Senate. Demonstrators chanted “ICE out” and called on lawmakers to reject any additional funding for ICE and Customs and Border Protection.

Organizers said the event was planned in less than 24 hours and was part of a broader effort to pressure federal lawmakers.

Roxana Norouzi, executive director of OneAmerica, said the demonstration reflected both anger and grief over the impact of immigration enforcement.

“I feel angry, I feel heartbroken that this is what we have to be here doing,” Norouzi said. “Not only lives lost, but families separated because of this cruelty.”

Norouzi said the group’s primary demand was that senators oppose funding for ICE and push for greater accountability.

“We want Senator Murray and Cantwell to not only vote no, but use the power they have to refuse to give even one more dollar to ICE or Customs and Border Patrol,” she said.

The rally remained peaceful and took on the atmosphere of a demonstration rather than a march, with live music and speeches. No arrests were reported.

Cameron Lavi-Jones, a musician who performed at the rally, said the event was intended to encourage action beyond public demonstrations.

“My goal here today is to remind people that there’s still tangible actions that we can do,” Cameron said. “This only works if there’s tangible action.”

Lavi-Jones said fear within immigrant communities was a driving force behind the protest.

“People are scared to leave their houses. Children are being targeted,” Lavi-Jones said. “We cannot allow it to continue forward.”",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/65b532f4-918b-4408-9db0-7612a4317064/20260127T064503/65b532f4-918b-4408-9db0-7612a4317064_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 14:59:23.388639

In a statement reported by CNN, Walz said he had outlined the state's priorities to Homan, including impartial investigations into the two shootings and reducing the 3,000-strong force of federal agents that has been deployed to the city. Homan and Walz agreed to ""continue working toward those goals,"" the governor said.

The move to install Homan in place of top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who sources said is leaving after having led most of Trump's crackdowns in Democratic-led cities, is part of a broader reset by the president amid some advisers' concerns that the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents could derail his immigration agenda.

Homan's job in Minneapolis is to ""recalibrate tactics"" and improve cooperation with state and local officials, a source with ties to the White House said.

""The goal is to scale back, eventually pull out,"" the source added.

Homan is also expected to sit down with Mayor Jacob Frey, Trump said on social media.

The president spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers to reassess the administration's response to Pretti's death on Saturday, according to the same source and a White House official.

The discussions included reducing the number of agents in Minnesota, recalibrating the mission to focus more narrowly on deportations rather than broad enforcement operations and exploring greater coordination with state authorities. Trump also weighed whether immigration officers should be required to have body-worn cameras, as many police officers do, according to the White House official.

SUPPORT FOR TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION DRIVE WANES

The killing of Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents on Saturday during daytime protests, has become a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations.

Coupled with the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti's shooting sparked renewed anger over the aggressive tactics of the federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.

Late on Monday, Minnesota's chief federal judge threatened to hold the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, in contempt for his agency's failures to comply with court orders that some detainees receive bond hearings.

""The court's patience is at an end,"" U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in ordering Lyons to appear before him on Friday.

Bystander video of Pretti's killing was widely shared, contradicting some Trump officials' initial claims that Pretti, who was legally carrying a concealed gun but never touched it prior to being shot, posed a threat to law enforcement.

Public support for Trump's immigration enforcement tactics appeared to be waning both before and after the Pretti shooting, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. The issue has put Republicans on the defensive ahead of November's midterm elections, when the party's narrow congressional majorities are at stake.

TRUMP IN DAMAGE CONTROL MODE

The president held a two-hour meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office on Monday evening after Noem asked to meet, a source briefed on the matter confirmed. Noem's job is not in jeopardy, the source said. The New York Times first reported the meeting.

The typically combative Trump has also struck a more conciliatory tone in public remarks. He characterized private conversations with both Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday as productive, while the two Democratic leaders offered similarly positive comments, a far cry from the vitriol the two sides had previously exchanged.

Walz's office said Trump had agreed to direct DHS to ensure state authorities could conduct their own investigation into the Pretti shooting, while Frey said on X that his understanding was that some federal agents would begin leaving the city on Tuesday.

Privately, Trump made clear to advisers he did not want to defend the agent's actions or attack Pretti, after Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller labeled Pretti an ""assassin"" and Bovino suggested he intended to ""massacre"" officers, among other attacks from administration officials. Video footage of the incident verified by Reuters contradicted those allegations.

Senior aides were asked not to target Pretti publicly, and the president discussed distancing himself from public comments made by Miller and Noem, the White House official said.

Bovino, who said the officers who killed Pretti were the true victims in Saturday's shooting, is expected to depart Minneapolis along with some Border Patrol agents deployed with him, a senior administration official told Reuters on Monday.

Another person familiar with the matter said Bovino had been stripped of his specially created title of ""commander at large"" and would return to his former job as a chief patrol agent along California's El Centro sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, before retiring soon after.

Asked about Bovino's future on Tuesday, DHS pointed to a statement from spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin on Monday that said, ""Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties.""

DHS officials described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun, even though video showed Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as agents wrestled him to the ground.

It also showed officers removing a firearm from his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner who lived half a mile from the scene.

Gun rights groups have pushed back on Trump administration officials' suggestion that Pretti should not have been armed, a rare election-year rift between Republicans and one of their most loyal voting blocs.

The Justice Department has sued at least 24 states and territories, including Minnesota, to force them to turn over their voter data.","After federal immigration agents shot and killed an American citizen in Minneapolis for the second time this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota that outlined what she described as three “simple steps” to “bring back law and order.”

Her final step, however, seemed to have little to do with immigration or the state’s fraud scandal, the stated reasons for the federal government’s presence in Minnesota.

“Third, allow the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota’s voter registration practices comply with federal law,” she wrote. Minnesota’s secretary of state, Steve Simon, a Democrat, swiftly rejected the demand, calling it an “outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. citizens in violation of state and federal law.”

Ms. Bondi’s request was part of a nearly yearlong fight in which the Trump administration has sought voters’ private data from states across the country. Numerous states, including Minnesota, have not complied, and the Justice Department has sued them.

Here’s a look at what is happening and the concerns over privacy and elections that have arisen:

What, exactly, are these voter rolls?

Nearly every state has a public version of its voter roll that includes basic information like first and last names. Some of these rolls include addresses.

But the complete, unredacted voter file includes personal identifying information, like driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers. This list is kept private and is maintained by top election officials in each state.

Traditionally, no one can obtain it through public records requests — not even the Justice Department.

Why does the Justice Department want these files?

Ms. Bondi has said that the Trump administration is trying to keep elections secure. But President Trump and his allies — who tried to overturn the 2020 election and continue to deny its legitimacy — have long pushed unsubstantiated claims about undocumented immigrants voting illegally.

And last year, the Justice Department began to try to build the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, raising concerns that the data could be used to cast doubt on future election results.

Is this a normal request?

No, it’s highly unusual.

The Justice Department has taken aggressive steps in the past to try to root out voter fraud, including during former President George W. Bush’s administration. But the idea of the federal government obtaining states’ private voter information was long seen as an overreach, because the Constitution dictates that elections are run mainly by individual states, not the administration in Washington.

How many states have complied?

At least 11, all of them at least partly run by Republicans, according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights and democracy group. Some other states, largely Republican-led ones, have provided their voter data to a separate but related program in the Department of Homeland Security.

But roughly half of the country’s states, most of them led by Democrats, have rejected the requests. The Justice Department has sued at least 24 states and territories, including Minnesota, to force them to turn over their voter data.

Why have states refused?

Some states, including Minnesota, have laws that prevent the transfer of private information. Others have expressed worries about how the Justice Department will keep the enormous troves of private information secure.

But for many election officials and voting rights experts, the main concern is that the Justice Department’s effort is led by Trump allies who long falsely denied that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the 2020 election.

“These data can be manipulated to support false claims about ineligible voting and justify efforts to thwart free and fair elections,” Wendy Weiser, who directs the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, wrote on social media.

The Minnesota secretary of state, Mr. Simon, said this possibility was on his mind.

“Though I’m not necessarily predicting direct federal interference with elections, I am planning for it,” he said in an interview, “and it would be irresponsible to not do that.”

Do states have a right to withhold the data?

This is still being litigated, but some legal experts have pointed to the Constitution’s language that the “times, places and manner” of elections are governed by the states, and that only Congress — not the president — can make or change election laws.

This month, a federal judge in California dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against California seeking to obtain its full voter roll.

“The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,” wrote Judge David O. Carter, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. “The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the legislative branch, not the executive.”

And on Monday, a federal judge in Oregon said during a hearing that he was dismissing the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the state, with a written opinion to follow in the coming days.

The judge, Mustafa T. Kasubhai, had called the hearing to address Ms. Bondi’s letter, but he said he was making his decision on other legal grounds. Still, he suggested that he had concerns about “the basis and the purpose” of the Justice Department’s pursuit of voter records based on what Ms. Bondi wrote.

Are there any other concerns?

Election officials also say that any national voter roll within the Justice Department would probably be rife with errors because each state’s voter file is updated every day, changing as voters move away or die.

“If any state were to provide a voter list, and the list against which the federal government or anyone else is checking it is out of date, you’re going to have a lot of falsely identified ineligible voters,” Mr. Simon said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/us/politics/pol-minnesota-voter-rolls/pol-minnesota-voter-rolls-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:58:36.417224

So does the resistance by the U.S. labour movement, community and faith groups.

Last week’s ICE OUT Day of Truth and Freedom, backed by unions, faith groups and immigrant rights organizations, was the latest nationwide show of force by workers refusing to remain silent.

In Minneapolis – the site of a massive surge of immigration officers and three shootings in three weeks, two fatal– hundreds-of-thousands braved frigid temperatures to demand justice and accountability.

UNI affiliates including CWA, SEIU, UFCW and UNITE HERE have been out front and vocal in Minnesota and around the country.

Condemning the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE, CWA President Claude Cummings said: “I honour the bravery of every American with the courage to peacefully protest or picket today.”

Additionally, CWA locals in Minnesota are mobilizing for the families of two members abducted by ICE.

SEIU Minnesota issued a forceful call:

“Children are being taken, our neighbours afraid to leave their homes and Minnesotans being killed by federal agents in our streets. ENOUGH. Our families are not safe with ICE here. ICE MUST LEAVE MINNESOTA NOW.”

With a significant portion of their membership made of immigrants, UNITE HERE Local 17 has stepped up mutual aid efforts so that union members can have food and other essentials while in hiding from ICE.

In a statement praising the 23 January day of action, UFCW 663 said:

It says the court granted a petition on Jan. 14 to provide him with a bond hearing within seven days.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schiltz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

""This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,"" the judge wrote.

The order comes a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the second death this month of a person at the hands of an immigration law enforcement officer.

Trump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had ""great calls"" with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.

As he left the White House, the president was asked whether Alex Pretti's killing by a Border Patrol officer Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a ""big investigation"" was underway.

Walz's office said Tuesday that the Democratic governor met with Homan and called for impartial investigations into the shootings involving federal officers. They agreed on the need to continue to talk, according to the governor.

WATCH: Sadness, anger and exhaustion grip Twin Cities after latest killing by federal agents

The White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of federal officers conducting immigration raids. But after the killing of Pretti on Saturday and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Immigration agents were active Tuesday across the Twin Cities region, and it was unclear if officials had changed tactics after the shift in tone from the White House.

The streets appeared largely quiet in many south Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been sighted regularly in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where the two deaths occurred. But Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis, as well as the northern suburb of Little Canada.

WATCH: Border Patrol 'untrained and unskilled' for policing in urban areas, ex-CBP head says

Schiltz's order also follows a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to order a halt to the immigration law enforcement surge. The judge said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.

Schiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. ""But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,"" he said.

""Respondents have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders, and that they have taken steps to ensure that those orders will be honored going forward,"" he wrote. ""Unfortunately, though, the violations continue.""

The Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

The order lists the petitioner by first name and last initials: Juan T.R. It says the court granted a petition on Jan. 14 to provide him with a bond hearing within seven days. On Jan. 23, his lawyers told the court the petitioner was still detained. Court documents show the petitioner is a citizen of Ecuador who came to the United States around 1999.

The order says Schiltz will cancel Lyons' appearance if the petitioner is released from custody.

Walz's office said in a statement that he had a ""productive"" call with the president about an hour after Trump himself said the two were on a ""similar wavelength.""

The comments mark a major tonal shift and come amid growing backlash after federal immigration agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis this month, including Pretti, an ICU nurse who treated veterans, and Renee Nicole Good, a poet and mother of three.

Republican lawmakers have increasingly called for investigations into the killing of Pretti as Democrats refuse to fund the Department of Homeland Security despite the likelihood of a government shutdown.

Trump on Monday said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to lead some operations on the ground. In Minneapolis, thousands of protesters braved subzero temperatures to decry the shooting and call for an end to the federal intervention.

Meanwhile, a federal judge on Monday heard arguments over the legality of the ongoing immigration enforcement in Minnesota. Another judge will consider whether to extend an order barring federal authorities from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the deadly shooting of Pretti.

Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino leaving Minneapolis

Homeland Security’s top immigration enforcer is reportedly leaving Minneapolis amid the ongoing fallout in the city.

Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino will leave the Midwestern city, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press and The New York Times reported on Monday, citing officials familiar with the matter.

Bovino’s departure from Minnesota comes as the White House on Monday announced that border czar Tom Homan is being sent to the state as the Trump administration’s new point person for immigration enforcement operations.

The Atlantic Magazine reported Monday evening that Bovino is set to return to his post at the El Centro Border Station in California. CNN reported his access to social media accounts had been suspended.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin in a statement vehemently denied the shakeup.

""Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties,"" said McLaughlin, adding the chief remains ""a key part of the President’s team and a great American.""

Bovino has spearheaded the Trump administration's militarized approach to immigration enforcement, tussling with protesters and throwing chemical irritants into crowds in multiple states. In Minneapolis, the Border Patrol commander-at-large has declared that the agents who killed Alex Pretti were victims, not the slain nurse.

""The suspect put himself in that situation; the victims are the Border Patrol agents,"" Bovino said of Pretti.

Poll shows Trump's immigration approval drops to new low

American approval of the president’s immigration policy dropped to its lowest level since his return to the White House, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found, amid growing backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis this month.

The poll, conducted nationwide Jan. 23 through Jan. 25, gathered responses before and after immigration officers on Jan. 24 killed a second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis. About 53% of Americans polled disapprove of the president's immigration policy, while 39% approve of the job Trump is doing on immigration, down from 41% in the prior Reuters/Ipsos poll this month.

Poll results show a steep drop in approval from where Trump began after his inauguration. Immigration was a brighter spot then; in Feb. 2025, 50% approved and 41% disapproved.

Alex Pretti sister issues statement: 'When does this end?'

Pretti’s sister shared a statement Monday celebrating her older brother’s efforts to help others and slamming federal officials spreading ""disgusting lies"" about him.

""All Alex ever wanted was to help someone — anyone,"" Micayla Pretti said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. ""Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that.""

Micayla Pretti also called out federal officials for their characterization of her sibling. Top figures in the Trump administration described Pretti as a ""would-be assassin"" and ""domestic terrorist.""

""When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?"" Micayla Pretti asked. ""Hearing disgusting lies spread about my brother is absolutely gut-wrenching.""

Pretti remembered at Green Bay school board meeting by former teachers

What would’ve been a normal Green Bay School Board meeting, held on Jan. 26, opened instead with a speech by board president James Lyerly, honoring Pretti as a ""conscientious, civic-minded individual.""

""His life reflects the values that we strive to instill in our students,"" Lyerly said. ""Compassion, service and responsibility to others.""

Pretti was a former Green Bay Preble High School student who was deeply involved in the performing arts.

Seven people spoke for about 30 minutes during the open forum portion of the meeting, memorializing the singer, helper and leader they knew in school.

""We will always value his leadership and spread some of the kindness that he gave to others,"" Carol Miller, former Preble musical director, said. ""That’s the ripple effect. And I think that’s where his legacy therein lies.""

Susan McAllister said she could still see Pretti, who was her music student for all four years of high school, standing in the bass section of the choir.

""My heart is broken under Alex’s death. And of course, like everybody else, I am deeply angry,"" McAllister said. ""But I am also so, so proud of the young man I knew.""

Trump speaks to Minneapolis Mayor Frey, touts ‘lots of progress’

Trump said he spoke to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey by phone on Monday, characterizing it as a positive discussion after speaking earlier in the day with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The communication with the two Democratic officials comes as the White House tries to calm tensions following Alex's Pretti's death on Saturday.

“I just had a very good telephone conversation with Mayor Jacob Frey, of Minneapolis,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Lots of progress is being made!”

Trump also said his new point person for immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, border czar Tom Homan, will meet with Frey on Tuesday “in order to continue the discussion.”

DHS has body-worn camera footage of Pretti shooting: report

Homeland Security officials said the agency has body-worn camera footage of Alex Pretti’s fatal shooting, according to a report from NBC News.

Agency Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told NBC that Homeland Security investigators have videos recorded by multiple agents of the shooting that’s sparked outrage across the country.

Several bystanders recorded cell phone video of the shooting, and witnesses provided sworn testimony to what they saw. But the body-worn cameras could provide the clearest picture yet of the shooting and moments that led up to it.

Homeland Security officials did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment.

Leavitt addresses 'domestic terrorism' allegations from White House officials

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to distance President Donald Trump from White House officials’ allegations that Alex Pretti was committing “domestic terrorism” when he was shot and killed by federal authorities.

Stephen Miller, deputy White House chief of staff, called Pretti a “would-be assassin” shortly after Saturday’s killing and said the 37 year old was attempting to “murder federal agents.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Pretti of being a domestic terrorist.

“I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way; however, I have heard the president say he wants to let the facts of the investigation to lead itself,” Leavitt said during a Monday briefing with reporters when asked whether the president shares Miller’s and Noem’s positions.

A reporter asked Leavitt whether Miller would be apologizing to Pretti’s family over his comments.

“Look, again, this incident remains under investigation,"" Leavitt responded. ""And nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives on American streets.”

White House blames Democrats for Pretti fatal shooting

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats in Minnesota for the killing of Alex Pretti.

Leavitt accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers,” blocking state and local officials from cooperating with immigration authorities and using their platforms to encourage “left-wing agitators” to confront and obstruct agents.

“Let's be clear about the circumstances which led to that moment on Saturday,” Leavitt said during a Monday press briefing. “This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.”

Levitt noted that the federal investigation into Pretti’s killing remains open.

""Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,"" Leavitt said. ""This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement, and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals.""

Leavitt said later in the briefing that actions by Walz and Frey are what ""led to the moment that we are in today,"" where Trump and Walz got on the phone to discuss the situation. She described the call as a ""constructive and productive conversation to end the chaos and the lawlessness that has taken place"" in Walz' home state.

White House says Minnesota, Minneapolis need to help enforce immigration laws

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said there is “a clear and simple path” that Minnesota could take to assist federal law enforcement so that “Customs and Border Patrol will not be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota.”

She said Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey need to turn over unauthorized immigrants with criminal records who are in their prisons.

She said state and local police should turn over all undocumented immigrants in custody.

She said state and local police need to help with immigration enforcement against people wanted for crimes, “especially violent crimes.”

A report by the libertarian Cato Institute found that only 5% of people had violent convictions, and 73% had no criminal convictions. A report from the Guardian found that immigrants with no criminal records are driving the record high number of detentions.

Walz’s office said in a previous statement that the state of Minnesota honors Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers, and “there is not a single documented case of the department’s releasing someone from state prison without offering to ensure a smooth transfer of custody.”

Trump says DOJ is investigating Rep. Ilhan Omar over her wealth

Trump said the Justice Department is investigating Rep. Ilhan Omar over the Minnesota Democrat's personal wealth, escalating his attacks against a political rival he's said should be deported.

Trump announced the move in a Monday post on Truth Social, saying the Justice Department and Congress ""are looking at 'Congresswoman' Illhan Omar, who left Somalia with NOTHING, and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars. Time will tell all."" Trump misspelled the congresswoman's first name in the post.

The president has ramped up his insults and attacks on Omar, a Somali-American, in recent weeks following revelations of a massive fraud scheme involving state and federal welfare assistance programs tied primarily to a group of Somali immigrants.

Trump has questioned how Omar, a U.S. citizen since 2000, accumulated her wealth. According to a financial disclosure filed with Congress, Omar's net worth skyrocketed in 2025, with the lawmaker posting between $6 million and $30 million in income through her spouse's stake in a California winery and a venture capital firm.

Gov. Walz’s office says call with Trump ‘productive'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asked President Donald Trump for “impartial investigations” into federal shootings in Minneapolis and to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota, according to a statement from the governor’s office.

“The president agreed that he would talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,” the statement said.

“The president also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals,” the statement continued.

Walz's office also said he “reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn’t a U.S. citizen.

“There is not a single documented case of the department’s releasing someone from state prison without offering to ensure a smooth transfer of custody,” the statement said.

Patel says FBI is investigating protests in Minneapolis

FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday the agency is investigating tips from conservative influencers about coordinated protests in Minneapolis that may cross into incitement of violence or threats to law enforcement.

Patel said he’ll balance the First and Second Amendment protections in his decisions, but warned that funding and instigating violence would draw his attention. “You cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps or puts law enforcement in harm’s way,” Patel said.

On Jan. 25, Patel said the FBI arrested an individual in connection with an incident in Minneapolis where an individual allegedly stole an agent’s identification and threatened the agent’s family. He pledged more arrests related to the Jan. 14 incident.

Mike Pence calls for probe of Pretti shooting, joining other Republicans

Former Vice President Mike Pence said footage of the killing of Alex Pretti was ""troubling"" and called for a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the shooting.

Pence joins a growing list of Republicans who've called for an investigation into the Border Patrol shooting, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky.

""The focus now should be to bring together law enforcement at every level to address the concerns in the community even while ensuring that dangerous illegal aliens are apprehended and no longer a threat to families in Minneapolis,"" Pence said on X.

""The American people deserve to have safe streets, our laws enforced and our constitutional rights of Freedom of Speech, peaceable assembly and the right to keep and bear Arms respected and preserved all at the same time,"" he added.

'Protesting is fine. The violence I don't like'

Outside a hotel in Minneapolis where protesters and federal agents clashed Sunday night, Geri McKerlie and her husband packed their minivan for a three-hour drive back to Wisconsin. The retired couple arrived in town Jan. 23 for a cat-showing for a competition and were woken up overnight by protesters outside.

As the couple loaded up cat carriers, they noticed a small black SUV with broken windows, covered in red spray paint. The Home2 Suites was covered in red and black spray painted epithets and demands that ICE leave. The doors were locked to non-guests and at least one uniformed security officer was visible inside the lobby the morning of Jan. 26.

“Protesting is fine. The violence I don’t like,” McKerlie said as she supervised her husband, her breath steaming in the -5 degree morning. “When it sounded like they were down here playing drums I wondered if they were out there beating on cars.”

McKerlie they were relieved to be leaving Minneapolis following the Jan. 24 shooting of protest attendee Alex Pretti. “Illegals should be removed but ICE shouldn’t be going into churches and schools,” McKerlie said, referring to immigrants in the country illegally. “And ICE is making it worse- they need better training. They think of protesters as insurgents. They come at them with that attitude.”

Noem thanks Trump for sending border czar to Minnesota

The White House’s border czar Tom Homan will be ""managing ICE Operations on the ground in Minnesota,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. Trump had announced earlier in a Truth Social post that Homan will be sent to the state and report directly to him.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked the president for dispatching Homan, writing on X: ""This is good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis.""

""I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis,"" Noem added.

Protesters, federal agents clash at Minneapolis hotel

A group of protesters and federal agents clashed at a hotel in Minneapolis where demonstrators believed immigration officers were staying. Images show windows smashed and other tagged with graffiti reading “ICE OUT.”

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state patrol were called to assist with property damage at a hotel in the Prospect Park neighborhood.

The agency said the “demonstration was not peaceful,” but added that as officers worked to encircle the group and begin conducting arrests “federal agents arrived without communication and deployed chemical irritants, clearing the group.”

Trump sending border czar Homan to Minnesota

Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday morning that he was sending the White House’s border czar, Tom Homan, to Minnesota, in an apparent shake-up in leadership of the ICE operation.

Homan, he noted, has not been involved. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

The shift came as a group of Republicans in Congress publicly pushed the administration to rethink its approach after top Trump officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, made a series of assertions about the shooting that contradicted bystander video.

Sen. Thom Tillis warned that a rush to judgement would be an “incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy,” while House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said if “there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives” the president should consider withdrawing immigration agents from Minneapolis.

Judge to weigh order barring feds from destroying evidence

A judge in Minnesota is set to discuss a recent order barring federal officials from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti.

The order came hours after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing federal authorities of blocking state investigators from the scene of the shooting as well as key evidence.

A White House official told POLITICO on Monday that “Homan going is not a vote of confidence for” Noem.
Noem also elevated Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to serve as the essential head of operations in Minneapolis.
In the days after that shooting, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, a Noem ally who ran South Dakota’s Republican Party when Noem was the state’s governor, left her post in January to run for Congress in Ohio.
“It would be a win for the anti-border radicals” and “embolden” efforts to resist ICE operations elsewhere, Krikorian said.","“I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,” Curtis wrote.

Noem is also now expected to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee after maneuvering from the panel’s chair, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).

Conservative radio host Erick Erickson, an influential voice with evangelical voters central to the MAGA base, has jabbed Noem in social media posts since Saturday’s shooting, accusing her of “driving tensions” in the name of “great coverage.”

Frustrations with Noem are palpable among immigration hawks as well. Mark Krikorian, who leads the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions on legal immigration and crackdowns on unauthorized migration, said when asked about Noem’s standing in the administration that Noem has “made herself a lightning rod” for criticism.

Publicly, the White House is standing by Noem. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Monday that she enjoys “the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States.”

But the White House’s decision Monday to dispatch border czar Tom Homan to oversee ICE operations in Minneapolis suggests that Trump wants changes from the approach Noem has championed to date.

A White House official told POLITICO on Monday that “Homan going is not a vote of confidence for” Noem.

Noem has butted heads previously with Homan on how to approach enforcement. Homan, who spent most of his career working as an immigration officer, has pushed to protect ICE as an institution and focus efforts on deporting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Noem, meanwhile, has focused on using social media to project an image of exceedingly aggressive immigration enforcement.

Noem also elevated Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to serve as the essential head of operations in Minneapolis. Leavitt told reporters Monday that Homan, not Bovino, would be the “main point of contact” going forward in Minneapolis. Bovino is also being moved out of Minneapolis, an administration official told POLITICO.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Noem has said little since Trump distanced himself from the shooting on Sunday night, but she praised Trump’s decision to send Homan to Minneapolis in a social media post on Monday.

A senior DHS official, granted anonymity to speak about internal thinking, insisted Noem did her best to inform the public about the shooting and swatted away suggestions that discord exists among the president’s team.

“There is only one page: the president’s page. Everyone’s on the same page,” the official said.

Some in the administration were already frustrated with Noem’s reaction to the shooting of 37-year-old Nicole Good on Jan. 7, also in Minneapolis. The DHS chief seemingly rushed to respond to that incident before all the facts were known. In the days after that shooting, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, a Noem ally who ran South Dakota’s Republican Party when Noem was the state’s governor, left her post in January to run for Congress in Ohio.

Voters have soured on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in recent months. Republican polling firm Echelon Insights found in a survey of registered voters published Monday that more people now say ICE operations in public areas make them feel unsafe, a drop from their findings a few months ago when attitudes were more evenly split.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats have ramped up calls for Noem to resign or face impeachment proceedings over the way ICE and Border Patrol have conducted immigration enforcement operations and for allegedly mismanaging a major infusion of federal funds into the department allocated via the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Other Republican lawmakers, while not naming Noem, have called on the agency leaders that report to her to testify. Some, such as House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), represent states or congressional districts where Trump only narrowly defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections.

Despite the growing pressure on Noem, Krikorian argued she’s unlikely to be ousted.

Chief US district judge Patrick Schiltz demanded ICE lead Todd Lyons explain himself personally in a three-page order issued Monday evening, declaring that “the court’s patience is at an end”.

The rebuke follows weeks of tilting anger during the so-called “Operation Metro Surge”, the Trump administration’s large-scale, aggressive and now deadly immigration enforcement campaign in Minneapolis-St Paul. The operation has generated numerous emergency lawsuits from immigrants claiming unlawful arrest or detention, with judges consistently ruling in their favor.

Schiltz, appointed by George W Bush, accused the Trump administration of deliberately delaying or ignoring judicial directives across Minnesota’s federal courts. His order came in the case of a man he had ordered released on 15 January who remained in custody as of Monday night.

The judge said the government’s non-compliance had caused “significant hardship” to immigrants, many of whom had lived and worked legally in the United States for years. He described detained individuals being sent to Texas when they should remain in Minnesota, or being released far from home without means to return.

Other Minnesota federal judges have voiced similar concerns. US district judge Michael Davis, a Clinton appointee, accused the administration of attempting to “defy court orders” and “deny noncitizens their due process rights”.

Several judges are now considering broader legal challenges that could significantly restrict federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota or halt Operation Metro Surge entirely. Another federal judge is weighing whether the deployment of 3,000 immigration agents constitutes an unconstitutional occupation, a case that’s gained momentum following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal officers last week.

US district judge Kate Menendez has ordered government lawyers to respond by Wednesday evening to claims the operation was designed to punish the state for its sanctuary policies.

Schiltz also clashed with the administration last week when federal prosecutors sought his help arresting former CNN anchor Don Lemon and others linked to an anti-ICE church protest. After he declined to overturn a magistrate’s denial of arrest warrants, the justice department appealed directly to the eighth circuit court of appeals.

The circuit court rejected the government’s request, prompting Schiltz to write letters criticising the justice department’s approach and highlighting the flood of what he termed “illegal” detention cases overwhelming Minnesota courts.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63349b9f6a16dd8f42787f4dbb84c2287542f9c/524_0_3166_2533/master/3166.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=273158b497a3dab6988dc74709399534",N,,2026-01-27 13:59:20.344746

Students detained to meet deportation quotas

In May 2025, Sara Lopez Garcia was an honour student with a near-perfect 4.0 GPA and a bright future ahead of her. “A stellar student,” says Cynthia Eaton, one of Sara’s professors at Suffolk County Community College. The day before her graduation from Suffolk, Sara and her mother were detained in an ICE raid at their home. Sara had special immigration status and was working towards obtaining her U.S. citizenship. Both she and her mother had valid Social Security numbers and valid work permits. In fact, Sara and her mother had not been targeted by ICE at all. Federal agents were looking for a previous tenant when they came across the family. After two harrowing months of isolation, uncertainty and stress in a detention centre in South Louisiana, Sara agreed to be deported to her native Colombia. The deportation went ahead in July 2025, just months before what should have been her wedding day.

Sara’s story is not an isolated incident. Immigration raids have spiked across the U.S. since the Trump administration came to power in January 2025. Despite promises that ICE would target criminals, educators have reported many instances where students with no criminal history, no arrests, no deportation orders were abducted and deported to meet the arbitrary deportation quota of 3,000 people per day imposed by the Trump administration.

Just this month, the picture of five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos being detained by ICE agents in Minneapolis made headlines around the world. He is one of four students detained by ICE over the course of a single week in a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Despite the outcry, the majority of cases where children are arrested and deported are not covered in the media.

In Minnesota, ICE agents have been roaming neighborhoods, circling schools, and following the district’s yellow school buses, school officials said. In January, immigration agents pepper sprayed students and detained a staff member outside a Minneapolis high school during dismissal time. Immediately after this incident, the district cancelled classes which resumed a few days later with an option for virtual learning for students who are afraid to come to school.

School communities living in fear

The effect of immigration raids is felt in every corner of the classroom. Educators report plummeting attendance, emotional withdrawal, and families disappearing overnight.

The fear of ICE raids during school drop-off and pick-ups or at school bus stops is keeping many children and families away from school and inflicts immeasurable academic and emotional harm.

This crisis was directly caused by the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind the “sensitive locations” memo, which once discouraged immigration raids in schools, churches, and hospitals.

Teachers report that even the students who are still attending class are displaying symptoms of traumatic stress. While some fear for themselves and their immigrant families, others are worried about their friends and the upheaval their communities are going through.

In Minneapolis where the administration has deployed over 3,000 ICE agents, the community is on edge. This month, masked, heavily armed federal agents shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, after she dropped off her 6-year-old son at school. Another person was shot in the leg and just last week Alex Pretti, a registered nurse, was shot and killed after being restrained by ICE agents. Federal agents have been filmed acting violently and with impunity towards members of the community engaged in peaceful protest.

Impartial investigations into these incidents are not forthcoming as the Trump administration has consistently spread false narratives about the murders, has refused to allow local law enforcement to investigate, and has closed ranks to protect the ICE agents involved.

According to the National Education Association (NEA), “the Trump administration is now threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act and unleash the military in Minneapolis, in an escalation of federal force against those exercising their First Amendment rights. This is straight out of the authoritarian playbook. What we are witnessing is a federal occupation of a major American city—and it is not isolated. It is a warning to the entire country.”

Educators on the frontlines to protect students and families

Teachers and education staff have been mobilising in their schools and communities to protect students and vulnerable families.

Affiliated to both the NEA and the AFT, Education Minnesota has taken collective action against ICE presence in the state, joining the January 23rd protests.

Teachers and education support personnel in Minnesota and across the country have organised to protect immigrant families. School staff provide information and support to families in private because of fears that large school events would be targeted by ICE. Educators are also distributing red cards—wallet-size cards with language to assert one’s legal rights if approached by ICE agents.

Many are taking “Know Your Rights” trainings to learn how to respond safely during encounters with ICE, with unions providing resources to support these efforts. In just two days, the St. Paul Federation of Educators in Minesota trained 400 people to serve as school patrol volunteers. The union also has coordinated workshops for immigrant parents on how to complete the legal paperwork they need to keep their children safe, in case the parents are detained or deported.

Educators also work to help students navigate the anxiety and support families too afraid to leave their homes. Many spend their evenings arranging food and supply drop off or helping families register for food banks and employment resources.

“We cannot and will not be silent. As educators, we have a moral and professional responsibility to keep all students safe, no matter where they were born or who they are, both in school and in their communities. Federal terror has no place in public education or in a democracy. This moment requires moral clarity and courage—because this is not just an immigration issue. It is a human rights issue, a civil rights issue, and a democracy issue,” said Becky Pringle, EI vice-president, President of the NEA, the largest labour union in the U.S. and an Education International affiliate.

Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), also an EI affiliate, stressed that “ICE must leave our schools and communities immediately—they are making us less, not more, safe. This is a moral moment to come together as Americans around the principle that schools and communities must be safe and welcoming places, not targets for militarized incursions designed to pit us against each other.”

Both the NEA and the AFT have called on elected officials at every level to act to protect students and keep ICE and other federal agents out of schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

“Arresting and deporting preschool children, honor students, and teaches, killing people, including US citizens, with impunity is state terror and deliberate cruelty, and we will not stand for it. Teachers and education workers in the United States are rallying for their students and their communities. They do not stand alone. The entire global education community stands with them as they rise to protect democracy, the rule of law, and basic humanity in the United States”, stated David Edwards, Education International General Secretary.",https://www.ei-ie.org/image/Ax4EYOq6m30mVTq9YLb35v9EojELQrlmUzhQtwH2.jpg/lead.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:21:51.086323

What they're saying: There has been friction between Homan and Noem, but the White House downplayed any tension among the officials affected by Monday's moves.","""It's f**ked, and POTUS knew he needed to unf**k it,"" an administration adviser told Axios.

Zoom in: Trump's most significant move came Monday morning, when he dispatched White House border czar Tom Homan to the Twin Cities — and essentially cut Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem out of the shambolic Minneapolis operation.

Soon after Homan's appointment, DHS announced that the hard-charging head of the controversial immigration efforts, U.S. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, would leave the state and return to his old job leading his sector in El Centro, Calif.

""He's a cowboy, and it was a mess. It was only escalation, and no one was going to back down,"" a source familiar with the operations said. ""Homan going is a good thing. Someone needed to step in.""

Driving the news: Trump spent Sunday lamenting his administration's botched response to Pretti's shooting, including news conferences by Bovino and Noem in which they seemed ""callous"" about the man's death, a confidant who spoke with Trump told Axios.

The White House wants to get the Minnesota immigration operation on solid footing as Senate Democrats threaten to shut down the federal government Friday because of the administration's controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

""So it's Tom Homan to the rescue,"" the confidant said.

Zoom out: A career immigration official who served under President Obama and Trump during his first term, Homan has a measure of credibility with the Democrats who run Minnesota that Noem — a committed Republican partisan — does not.

Homan plans to meet with law enforcement on the ground, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both of whom have accused immigration agents of terrorizing Minnesotans and called on the agents to leave.

Trump spoke with Walz and Frey on Monday and struck a new tone of cooperation.

A person familiar with Homan's plans said he'll help steer operational decisions and media presence.

Homan ""understands the silos that every single person has to operate in,"" a second source familiar with DHS operations said, referring to Homan's experience as a local police officer, CBP and ICE agent.

An administration official said Homan is likely to emphasize more targeted enforcement efforts with fewer confrontational tactics than Bovino, whose roving squads of masked officers were caught on video accosting residents such as two Target employees, both U.S. citizens, who were roughed up earlier this month.

The big picture: Trump wants a peace-with-honor withdrawal from Minnesota that doesn't look like his immigration surge was a loss driven by botched law enforcement efforts under Bovino, and plummeting poll numbers.

The administration wants Minnesota law enforcement to help with traffic and crowd control so that DHS can make immigration arrests without interference from the well-organized protesters in the Twin Cities.

Walz and local officials want an end to the heavy-handed federal immigration tactics that became a hallmark of Bovino's time there.

Three demonstrators have been shot by federal agents this month, including two fatally — Pretti and Renee Good.

Reality check: Trump has made friendly calls and peace offerings to Minnesota officials, but he's not going to pack up and leave the state.

""We can't lose Minneapolis because if we do, we lose Chicago and Los Angeles,"" an administration adviser said.

""We're not going to let the people who lost the presidential election over immigration dictate to us on immigration,"" the official said, referring to Democrats.

The backstory: Bovino and CBP agents have deployed to different operations across the country for months. They've been responsible for many of the aggressive arrest tactics and crowd confrontations caught in viral videos.

During Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, Border Patrol agents drew litigation over their use of force and chemical agents such as tear gas, plus a non-fatal shooting after which the agent involved was caught bragging about the act in text messages that were revealed in court.

Border Patrol officers ""train differently .... They're being deployed to the [U.S.] interior when they're used to dealing with single adult, military age males that could be cartel members or Chinese terrorists,"" the second source said.

What we know

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis today as President Donald Trump plans to reshuffle his immigration operation amid widespread backlash to two high-profile killings of civilians.

Bovino is losing his ""commander"" title, federal officials told NBC News, and will return to the border in El Centro, California, to resume his previous job as sector chief there.

Trump sent border ""czar"" Tom Homan to Minnesota to manage ICE operations on the ground. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott will be joining Homan, sources told NBC News.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Homan met today, where they ""agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals,"" according to the governor's office. Homan and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are set to meet today.

Bovino and others within the Trump administration have been roundly criticized following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, involving ICE and Border Patrol, amid a broader immigration crackdown.

Trump administration officials and allies told NBC News the president is ""concerned"" about the sustainability of the Minneapolis operations following Pretti's shooting.

Trump said on the radio show ""Sid & Friends in the Morning"" today that his calls with Frey and Walz were ""very good"" and ""very respectful.""

Walz tells Homan to end federal 'campaign of retribution' against Minnesota

In a meeting with Trump border czar Tom Homan this morning, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called for ""impartial investigations"" into the killings of Good and Pretti, a ""swift, significant reduction"" in the number of federal forces in the state, and ""an end to the campaign of retribution"" there.

Trump on Monday sent Homan to Minnesota, where the law enforcement officer will oversee ICE operations on the ground.

Walz and Homan ""agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday,"" the second-term Democratic governor's office said in a statement.

Walz tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the ""primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,"" Walz's office said in closing.

Woman charged with assault on a federal officer after biting off the tip of an agent’s finger

A woman is facing charges after allegedly biting off the tip of a finger of a federal immigration enforcement agent in Minnesota during a protest on Saturday morning.

Claire Feng was charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer in performance of their duties in connection with the Saturday morning incident that occurred after Pretti was fatally shot.

According to an affidavit, federal agents witnessed an interaction between protestors and other federal law enforcement at around 9:25 a.m., where a chemical agent canister was kicked towards the agents.

An arrest was made to arrest the individual who kicked the canister, and a melee ensued, the affidavit states. During the attempted arrest, a CBP agent fell to the ground and was tackled by an individual later identified as Feng, the affidavit states.

Agents from HSI tried to pull Feng off the CBP officer, and Feng ended up face down on the ground with her hands underneath her.

The affidavit states that a Customs and Border Protection Agent gained control of one of Feng’s arms, and reached under Feng’s body and across her face to grasp her other hand in an attempt to secure Feng’s second arm, according to the affidavit. “Feng then forcibly bit the right ring finger of the Victim,” a Customs and Border Protection Agent, the affidavit states.

“The victim was extremely cold, and the Victim’s vision was distorted due to wearing a gas mask. As a result, the Victim was not wore of the severity of Feng’s bit but knew he was injured,” the affidavit states. “The Victim then removed his glove and noticed the tip of his right ring finger had been bitten off by Feng from the nailed, leaving his bone exposed.”

The affidavit indicates the victim found the tip of his finger inside his glove and was able to get medical attention almost an hour after the incident occurred.

Feng was released from custody by a federal judge on her own recognizance. A preliminary hearing in the matter has yet to be set.

Rep. Ilhan Omar to hold town hall amid war of words with Trump

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., plans to host her first in-person town hall meeting of the year tonight in North Minneapolis, where she will ""provide an update on the work being done at the local, state, and federal levels to hold ICE accountable"" for its immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.

The town hall comes a day after Trump said the Justice Department and Congress are ""looking at"" Omar, a vocal progressive critic of the president who has frequently been in his crosshairs. Trump's administration is investigating massive fraud in Minnesota, which the president has said is ""at least partially responsible for the violent, organized protests going on in the streets.""

Omar has denied any wrongdoing and accused the president of ""deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me.""

Biden says Minneapolis violence 'betrays our most basic values'

Former President Joe Biden on Tuesday condemned the killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti, and praised Minnesotans for ""speaking out against injustice when they see it.""

""What has unfolded in Minneapolis this past month betrays our most basic values as Americans,"" Biden said in a three-paragraph post on X. ""We are not a nation that guns down our citizens in the street. We are not a nation that allows our citizens to be brutalized for exercising their constitutional rights. We are not a nation that tramples the 4th Amendment and tolerates our neighbors being terrorized.""

The former Democratic president said Minnesotans protesting the federal government's immigration crackdown have ""reminded us what it is to be American, and they have suffered enough at the hands of this Administration.""

Biden did not mention Trump by name, but he alluded to the president, saying in part: ""No single person can destroy what America stands for and believes in, not even a President, if we — all of America — stand up and speak out.""

In closing, Biden called for ""full, fair and transparent investigations"" in the fatal shootings of Good and Pretti ""as we all mourn their senseless deaths.""

Here's where senators stand on addressing the shooting

A dozen Senate Republicans have called for an investigation into Pretti's killing in Minneapolis. This includes Sens. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, Katie Britt of Alabama, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Mike Crapo of Idaho.

Across the aisle, 11 Senate Democrats have called for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be fired, impeached or to resign. The group includes Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Alex Padilla of California.

A group of Senate Democrats, too, has said they will vote against an appropriations package if it includes DHS funding. If the appropriations package does not pass by the end of the month, the government will enter a partial shutdown.

Border Patrol commander and some agents to leave Minneapolis, a source says

Amid ongoing tensions in Minneapolis, a Trump administration official tells NBC News that an unknown number of federal agents will leave the city and border czar Tom Homan will now take over operations and replace controversial Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino. The staffing change comes amid deepening fallout over the death of Alex Pretti.

The Department of Homeland Security confirms multiple body cameras worn by the agents involved captured the shooting, which investigators are now reviewing.

GOP Rep. Mike Lawler calls for Congress and Trump to 'embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy'

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said in an op-ed for The New York Times that Congress and Trump must ""embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy that acknowledges Americans’ many legitimate concerns about how the government has conducted immigration policy.""

He urged collaboration between federal, state and local law enforcement, as well as congressional hearings with top immigration enforcement officials.

""After tensions have calmed, Congress can then piece together the rest of an immigration plan that settles the issue,"" Lawler wrote. ""Along with building on Mr. Trump’s border policies, a realistic plan would provide a path to legal status — not citizenship — for long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records.""

The Republican chairs of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have called for testimony from the leaders of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Sen. Rand Paul says officers in Pretti shooting should be put on leave

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said today the officers involved in the Pretti shooting should ""immediately"" be placed on administrative leave ""until an independent investigation is concluded.""

""For calm to be restored, an independent investigation is the least that should be done,"" Paul said in a post on X.

Paul announced yesterday he is calling the heads of three Department of Homeland Security agencies — ICE, CBP and USCIS — to testify before his Senate committee Feb. 12.

The third-term Republican has quickly become a leading GOP congressional voice calling for investigations and oversight on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota.

DHS confirms ICE will be present at Olympics

Trump on Minnesota immigration enforcement: 'If you give us the criminals, it all goes away'

Trump said in an interview this morning on the radio show ""Sid & Friends in the Morning"" that his calls with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were ""very good"" and ""very respectful.""

Asked about the possibility of a compromise with Minnesota officials, Trump said, ""I think so.""

""What we need is their criminals,"" Trump said. ""You know, they have criminals. And all I said, 'Just give us your criminals. And if you give us the criminals, it all goes away.' They’re there to pick up murderers.""

Walz said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed yesterday that ""the Minnesota Department of Corrections honors all federal and local detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn’t a U.S. citizen.""

CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott to join Homan in Minneapolis

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott will be joining border czar Tom Homan in Minneapolis, one law enforcement official and a source familiar with the decision told NBC News.

Previously, Scott had been taking a back seat in Trump’s plans for mass deportations, as Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino was commanding the agents. As we reported last night, Bovino has now been removed from that position and sent back to his job as sector chief in El Centro, California.

Minnesota federal judge orders acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to appear in court

Chief Judge Patrick Schilz has ordered acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to appear in federal court to explain why a detainee was not given a bond hearing or released from detention in Minnesota.

Schilz had ordered the Trump administration to either give the detainee, named ""Juan,"" a bond hearing or let him go following his arrest this month in Minnesota.

""The Court’s patience is at an end,” Schilz said. “The Court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed.”

The judge said he will hold a hearing Friday at 1:00 p.m. local time in Minneapolis, where Lyons ""must appear in person to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for violating the Court’s January 14, 2026, order.""

If the parties file a notice before the hearing indicating that Juan has been released from custody, the court will cancel the hearing and will not require Lyons to appear, Schilz said.

Online fundraiser for Alex Pretti's family receives $1.5 million

More than $1.5 million has been donated to a fundraising campaign for the family of Alex Pretti, who was killed in Minneapolis on Saturday.

A GoFundMe page titled ""Alex Pretti is an American hero"" and verified by NBC News has received more than 37,000 donations.

""This fundraiser is intended to support the loved ones he leaves behind with immediate and ongoing needs. Because details are still unfolding, and to ensure the money goes to the right person, funds will not be distributed until we can verify next-of-kin and identify the appropriate family representative to manage anything raised,"" the page said.

The page added that if Pretti's next of kin can't be identified, the funds will go to the Immigrant Defense Project, ""a nonprofit that provides litigation, advocacy, and community-defense resources to help immigrants defend their rights and fight deportation.""

First lady Melania Trump calls for 'unity' in Minnesota

First lady Melania Trump has called for ""unity"" amid the ongoing protests and federal immigration operations in Minnesota, during which two people have been fatally shot.

Asked about the tensions in Minneapolis while appearing on ""Fox and Friends"" this morning, she said: ""We need to unify. I'm calling for unity. I know my husband, the president, had a great call yesterday with the governor and the mayor, and they're working together to make it peaceful and without riots. I'm against the violence.""

Melania Trump also urged protesters to ""protest in peace."" Local groups have organized peaceful protests involving thousands of people in recent weeks. Vice President JD Vance said in a speech in Minneapolis last week that the protesters there had been ""mostly peaceful.""

Investigators are reviewing body-camera videos in the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti

Investigators are reviewing body-camera videos from immigration agents in the fatal shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to NBC News.

Homeland Security investigators have videos recorded by cameras worn by multiple agents, department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.

The agents involved in the Pretti shooting were part of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, a specialized force, McLaughlin said. Two law enforcement officials told NBC News that the unit has more body-worn cameras.

Pretti was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Saturday, the city’s second fatal shooting by a federal officer this month amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in Minnesota.

Trump reshuffles his Minnesota operation after backlash from second fatal shooting

The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol over the weekend has Donald Trump “concerned” about the sustainability of his administration’s ongoing Minneapolis operations, according to Trump administration officials and allies.

These individuals acknowledged to NBC News that they needed a strategic shift amid a public uproar over Pretti’s killing, though the White House is still very much focused on its original agenda of cracking down on immigration and fraud.

Still, the changes made yesterday are noticeable. Saturday’s shooting has prompted a leadership shakeup, a reduction of agents in the city, a reset with key Democratic officials in the state and an attempt to distance the president from some of the more extreme comments from some of his top advisers.

“The visuals were not playing well. He understands TV. … He saw it for himself,” said a Republican lawmaker who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly.

And we should note we asked officials from Border Patrol, ICE and the White House to join us for an interview, but they declined our requests.

Meanwhile, the crackdown in Minnesota and the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens are raising questions about the tactics used by federal immigration agents.

To discuss that, I'm joined by former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske. He also served as the chief of local police departments in multiple cities.

Gil, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for being with us.

Gil Kerlikowske, Former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner: Sure.

Amna Nawaz:

So you have seen a number of videos circulating online, some even frame-by-frame analyses by different news outlets. I'm just curious, what stands out to you from what you have seen?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, the fact that they took him to the ground.

And he is resisting. But you would think that, with the number of agents that they had, they would be able to get his hands behind his back and get him secured and get him handcuffed. And it reminded you of kind of a football scrum, where they were all at different angles. So I didn't see them doing a particularly good job of securing him and getting him in custody.

Amna Nawaz:

Based on what you know about what happened before that interaction, what should have agents done in that case, in those circumstances?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, I think what they don't do and what they should be doing is that when they're confronted with somebody who is attempting to interfere or attempting to obstruct, they should tell that person we're arresting you.

This use of chemical munitions, just bringing out pepper spray, et cetera, just makes little sense. Police officers deal with these things all the time and they make a physical arrest. And that actually then deters some other people from getting involved or obstructing.

But, remember, this is a group of people, the Border Patrol in particular, who are completely untrained and unskilled for policing an urban environment.

Amna Nawaz:

I want to ask you a little bit more about that training. But can I just pick up on something you mentioned about attempting to interfere or attempting to obstruct, which is something we have heard from administration officials.

When you see the videos, is that what you see Alex Pretti doing? Many people say they see him stepping in to help a woman who was knocked down. Is that interference to you?

Gil Kerlikowske:

I see him stepping in where the agent has already knocked this woman down. And I don't condone that. I mean, that is totally wrong.

But as a person who's there to protest, observe, record, you want to not get involved. Even the guidelines the protest groups give you say you should stay five or six or seven feet away. Alex was in the heat of the moment and he didn't do that. And I wish he had.

Amna Nawaz:

You mentioned the training that these federal agents have before they go. And I want to point out a slight distinction here. When we talked about the shooting and killing of Renee Good, that was by an ICE agent. This was -- it looks like it was a Border Patrol agent in the shooting and killing of Alex Pretti.

From what you know, are they trained to work in these kinds of environments, crowd control, urban policing?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Not at all.

Commander Bovino from the Border Patrol talked about how they have offices in some different cities like Buffalo. I was the police commissioner in Buffalo for five years. I never saw a Border Patrol agent in the city. So they don't have that kind of experience and background and training to work in an environment that can actually become a bit hostile.

And city police officers know how to handle those things. It's very obvious that ICE and the Border Patrol do not.

Amna Nawaz:

The other thing we have heard from the administration officials is this idea that Alex Pretti was someone who was intent on harming federal agents. They say he approached officers with a gun, intended to massacre law enforcement.

The DHS secretary said that officers were acting defensively in their actions. I know there's a lot of video we haven't seen yet, but have you seen any evidence of those claims in the videos that are circulating now?

Gil Kerlikowske:

I did not see any of that. The only thing I did see in his hand was a cell phone.

Amna Nawaz:

So, to follow on that, we know that there's body camera footage from the federal agents that investigators are looking into, reportedly. There's also the phone that Alex Pretti himself seemed to be recording on. What do you think we can learn from those additional camera angles?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, body cameras have become very popular, and for a number of years.

And when I was at Customs and Border Protection, we experimented and the Border Patrol agents were keen to use them. The problem was, at that time, the technology did not hold up well in the environment that they worked in. But they said, look, this body camera will protect me more. It will show that what I did is lawful and restrained.

And now the administration doesn't want to use body cameras.

Amna Nawaz:

Can I ask big picture here? Because you mentioned these are not agents who are trained in the environment in which they're currently operating.

Two American citizens have now been killed by those federal agents in Minnesota. What do you think needs to happen so there's not a third citizen killed?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, one, the Border Patrol is clearly the wrong tool to be leading this effort, to be working in an urban environment.

And, frankly, the ICE section, the removal section, ERO, they were pretty good at being able to target people who were dangerous, target people with final orders of deportation and make those arrests. This walking through Walmart and Home Depot lot makes little sense.

And all Iran really does is, one, cause chaos, but you've also pretty much eroded the trust that law enforcement has gained in the last five years after the murder of George Floyd.

Amna Nawaz:

That is the former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske joining us tonight.

Thank you so much for your time.

Key observations and summary Read the report in full Read the response of the national authorities in full","In a report released today, the Council of Europe's Committee for the prevention of torture (CPT) calls on the state, entity and cantonal levels authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to issue a clear statement of zero tolerance of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, provide targeted training on manual control techniques, introduce audio-visual recording of all police interviews, and better regulate the use of force and the independent assessment of the proportionality of its use.

The primary objective of the report, based on a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 2024, was to examine the treatment of detainees, as well as that of sentenced and remand prisoners held in prison establishments. The situation of the residents of three social-care institutions in both entities that make up the state (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska (RS)) was also examined, along with that of foreign nationals deprived of their liberty under national immigration law.

Ill-treatment in detention documented

During the visit the committee received numerous allegations of physical ill-treatment of detainees by police officers in both entities. The alleged ill-treatment generally consisted of slaps, punches, kicks, blows with batons and from the barrel of pistols or assault rifles to various parts of the body. It was primarily inflicted by members of special intervention units of the Sarajevo and Tuzla cantonal special intervention police, the gendarmerie and the anti-terrorist unit of the Republika Srpska police (SAJ). The committee concludes that persons deprived of their liberty by these law-enforcement agencies are at risk of physical ill-treatment and of suffering serious injury.

The committee notes a downward trend in the prison population across state and entity prison systems and ongoing renovation efforts but calls for an end to the use of padded cells with straitjackets at Zenica prison and highlights sub-standard conditions in the remand section of Tuzla prison, including overcrowding, poor ventilation, inadequate hygiene and maintenance, vermin, and insufficient healthcare staffing. It also reiterates concerns about the de facto prolonged segregation of female remand prisoners due to the fragmented prison system. It recommends specific medical screening to identify risks, including mental-health needs and prior sexual or other gender-based violence.

Conditions in social care homes inadequate

The CPT found extremely poor living conditions in all three social care homes visited, with serious shortcomings in maintenance, cleanliness and hygiene. The worst conditions were in pavilions IV and V in Višegrad, where dilapidated facilities, broken furniture and appalling hygiene were observed, including residents lying in soiled bedding, lacking basic items such as pillows or bedding, and in some cases being found naked. The CPT considers that conditions in these two units may amount to inhuman and degrading treatment and calls for urgent improvements. It also demanded immediate action in a case where a female resident had been attached to a bed for several years. The committee urges reduced use of restraints and alternative measures to prevent self-harm.

Conditions for foreign nationals detained in a prefabricated container at Sarajevo airport were extremely poor, including a mother with young children held for three days without activities or outdoor exercise. The committee urged the authorities to replace it with a suitable holding facility. At Lukavica immigration detention centre, several detainees alleged severe physical ill-treatment by security staff of a foreign national with a serious mental disorder, who was found in critical condition in disciplinary solitary confinement and in urgent need of psychiatric care.

In their response, the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina focused on developments such as the training of police officers on the prevention of ill-treatment, and the creation of more effective systems for the reporting and investigation of allegations of police misconduct. The response also includes an update on the establishment of a preventive mechanism for the prevention of torture within the Ombudsman of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as its staffing and operationalisation.

That was the sign I held at the Minneapolis-St.Paul airport years ago as a refugee family emerged at baggage claim. They walked toward us tired and smiling, strangers waving American flags and holding handmade signs, welcoming them to their new home in the United States. They arrived with children in arms, several suitcases, and jackets that would soon prove no match for a Minnesota winter.

Two weeks earlier, the resettlement agency had called on short notice and asked if our group could assist with this family’s resettlement. We cleaned a rundown apartment, gathered donated furniture, found car seats and coats, bought phones, and stocked the fridge. All in the hope that when they arrived, they would feel comfortable.

That is what safety looks like in real life.

And now it is at risk.

In 1968, the United States ratified the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, committing the United States to a core legal protection known as non-refoulement. In plain terms, it prohibits returning refugees to persecution or torture. The United States later reinforced that obligation by ratifying the Convention Against Torture in 1994, which separately bars returning anyone to torture, regardless of immigration status.

That promise is not symbolic; it is codified in U.S. law. If a person has a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, the government is legally barred from returning them. The exceptions are narrow and require due process.

The treaty imposes additional obligations. People may not be punished solely for seeking safety, and detention is permitted only when necessary and subject to judicial review.

A treaty is only as strong as the system that enforces it. U.S. law and international human rights law agree on a basic point: The promise not to return someone to persecution or torture has meaning only if people are given a genuine opportunity to seek protection. That requires access to asylum screening, individualized hearings and a functional legal process.

Non-refoulement is therefore not merely a rule about outcomes. It is what’s known as a process-dependent obligation. When the immigration system is pushed so far beyond capacity that individuals cannot meaningfully present their claims for protection, the United States risks violating its legal commitments. That risk exists even without intent, and even before anyone is actually removed, when access to asylum or fair process is undermined.

Immigration enforcement is an executive function, but it is defined and limited by Congress. Congress defines the system, sets limits, and implements treaty obligations. For non-self-executing treaties like the Refugee Protocol, it is Congress, not the president that must give them legal effect. Without clear laws and oversight, treaty commitments risk being undermined by unilateral executive action.

The risk is no longer theoretical; three executive actions are now compounding decades of immigration system dysfunction and placing the United States at risk of violating its treaty obligations.

First, the federal government is rapidly expanding large-scale immigration enforcement.

In Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed at least 3,000 federal immigration agents in what state and city officials describe in court filings as a sweeping operation. Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have sued DHS alleging constitutional violations, including excessive force, warrantless arrests, and racial profiling.

The surge has coincided with the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, an autopsy-ruled homicide of a Cuban immigrant held by ICE in Texas, and documented abuse in overcrowded detention facilities. While these incidents differ in cause and context, they illustrate systemic stresses created by this administration’s immigration enforcement approach and raise questions regarding compliance with constitutional laws.

This is not an argument against immigration enforcement, but an argument against enforcement approaches that outpace due process and strain the very systems responsible for ensuring lawful removals. When enforcement overwhelms courts, attorneys, and detention capacity, the risk of refoulement rises sharply. That procedural failure is illustrated by the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite a standing court order barring his removal. It is also illustrated by the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, asylum seekers with active pending cases who are protected under both international and federal law.

Second, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has begun reopening settled refugee cases at scale.

In November, USCIS announced a review of refugees admitted between 2021 and 2025. On Jan. 9, it launched an operation targeting already-vetted and resettled refugees for what it terms “intensive verification.”

The initial focus is on 5,600 people in Minnesota who remain in refugee status while awaiting green cards. Resettlement agencies report that refugee families, including children, have been detained, separated and transferred out of state without access to counsel.

At the same time, a new USCIS policy is effectively preventing refugees from adjusting to lawful permanent resident status, undermining the requirements of the 1967 Protocol.

Under federal law, refugee determinations are made on a case-by-case basis and are considered settled unless the government proves fraud, material misrepresentation or a national security risk. The government must submit evidence and follow established legal procedures. To date, the administration has not pointed to any systemic failure in the refugee screening process, demonstrated patterns of fraud or any national security lapse that would justify reopening cases at this scale.

Courts have repeatedly held under administrative law that agencies must respect reliance interests and cannot reverse settled determinations without reasoned explanation, evidence and procedural safeguards. Large-scale reopenings of settled refugee cases are therefore legally vulnerable to challenge.

Third, the administration is moving to normalize denaturalization, the stripping of American citizenship.

On June 11, 2025, the Department of Justice instructed its attorneys to “prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings,” authorizing pursuit of any case officials deem “sufficiently important” and, according to internal guidance, setting targets of up to 100-200 denaturalization cases per month, a scale without modern precedent.

Denaturalization is an extraordinary remedy. It can occur only through federal court and only after the government meets a very high evidentiary standard, a process that typically takes years. Treating it as routine fraud enforcement transforms the nature of citizenship itself.

For refugees and asylees who later naturalize, citizenship is intended to be the final safeguard against return to persecution. Once revoked, a person becomes deportable and subject to the United States’ non-refoulement obligations. Even where citizenship is revoked for fraud, that determination does not resolve the separate legal question of whether removal would expose a person to persecution or torture, which requires its own evidentiary showing and individualized assessment under U.S. law. By expanding the pool of people subject to removal without clarifying evidentiary standards or selection criteria, the administration is placing new pressure on the courts and potentially re-exposing individuals to the very harms citizenship is meant to prevent.

The constitutional concern is not the existence of denaturalization authority, but its transformation from a rare remedy into a volume-driven enforcement tool.

Taken together, these actions reflect an executive branch pushing against judicial limits and setting the stage for a surge of constitutional challenges and denaturalization proceedings in federal court. At the same time, current executive enforcement approaches are overextending a federal immigration system carrying roughly 3.4 million immigration cases, a volume that strains due process and protective treaty compliance. When courts cannot hear claims in time, or access to counsel collapses under volume, non-refoulement is at serious risk of being violated in practice even if it remains intact on paper, a risk heightened as enforcement mechanisms grow more complex and removal pathways more indirect.

Congress exists to restrain executive power. Instead, it has underfunded immigration and federal courts through appropriations and largely abandoned its oversight role, leaving the judiciary to absorb the fallout of executive action under mounting capacity constraints.

When the system falters, the consequences do not remain in Washington. Raids happen in neighborhoods. Detentions overwhelm county jails. Arrests unfold on city streets. Requiring governors, mayors, police chiefs, judges, and local leaders to manage the fallout from federal decisions they did not make and congressional inaction they did not choose.

Some of these actions have already resulted in documented violations of court orders, statutory protections, and constitutional limits. Others are placing the system under conditions where further violations are not speculative but structurally inevitable.

The question now facing the country is simple: Will executive power remain bound by the Constitution, and will the United States honor its legal commitments at home and abroad?

This question cannot be answered by the courts alone. It requires a Congress willing to reclaim its constitutional authority before executive power hardens into unchecked rule. The Constitution is not a backdrop. It’s an active constraint that requires maintenance. As James Madison warned, the accumulation of power in a single branch of government is the definition of tyranny.

For constituents, this isn’t abstract. Members of Congress decide how many immigration judges are hired; whether DHS is meaningfully overseen; and whether agencies can reopen settled refugee cases without clear statutory limits. When those guardrails fail, treaty protections fail with them. Voters should press their representatives to explain how a system Congress designed became incapable of carrying out the law Congress enacted.

That means demanding oversight hearings on Homeland Security enforcement practices, statutory limits on post-admission refugee case reopenings, clear protections against routine denaturalization, and appropriations sufficient to restore due process in the immigration system.

Minnesota once met refugees at the airport with flags and handmade signs. We met them with coats, stocked fridges, and open doors. We told them that even in the coldest winters, they would not be alone.

That is the Minnesota they came to, and the Minnesota I remember.

That same Minnesota stands in the cold today, patrolling school drop-off points to protect children, delivering food to neighbors, and standing between fear and families as federal agents sweep through residential streets.

Minnesota kept its word.

Now the federal government must honor its law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trumpjan132026-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:22:08.636527

The administration is facing scrutiny after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, on Saturday, which came weeks after another fatal shooting in Minneapolis by a federal agent.

On Monday, President Trump announced he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee the operation. Meanwhile, despite internal scrunity from the Trump administration, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to keep her job, CBS News reported Tuesday, while her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the country's interior to securing the southern border and other priorities.

The Pennsylvania governor said the administration's tone appears to be changing, ""but the tactics haven't.""

""I will believe this president when he calls off the mission, when he ends it, when he sends these federal troops home and out of Minnesota and stops wreaking havoc on our communities,"" Shapiro added.

Asked whether Noem should be impeached, following growing support for the move among House Democrats, Shapiro said ""she was wholly unqualified when she got the job.""

""Trump should fire her,"" Shapiro added. ""And if Trump doesn't fire, the Congress should act.""

But Shapiro said he's most focused on ""whether or not Congress is going to stand up"" to oppose funds for immigration enforcement within the DHS funding measure, which is part of a six-bill package set to move through the Senate this week to avert a partial government shutdown at week's end.

""Congress needs to step up,"" Shapiro said. ""It's one thing for Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott and others to begin to show a little bit of spine here and standing up to the president. It's a whole other thing for them to vote to stop funding these kinds of missions. That's the most important vote this week.""

Shapiro argued that a shutdown wouldn't be necessary, citing some ""bipartisan consensus that the manner in which this deployment in Minnesota has been carried out is wrong and needs to end.""

""All the Congress needs to do is pull back on the funding and put specific language in the bill that says you can't fund an operation like what's going on in Minnesota,"" Shapiro said. ""There should be bipartisan consensus for that.""

Get the Facts: What is due process?

Due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

In the United States, due process is meant to safeguard against government overreach. The clause states that no state may deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of the law. The concept dates back to the Magna Carta of 1215, and due process remains at the core of the U.S. Constitution. ""One of the founding principles of the United States is that folks should be treated fairly, and due process ensures that,"" says CUNY constitutional law professor Jared Trujillo.This week, the chief federal judge in Minnesota said the Trump administration failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him on Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.What is due process? In simple terms, due process is what it means to have a fair trial. The due process clause, found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, is applied at the federal and state levels. It states that the government must follow certain procedures before depriving a person of their life, liberty or property. These procedures include, but are not limited to:Providing reasoning for legal action, such as an arrest.Being granted a chance to challenge any accusations made against you.Receiving a fair and impartial jury of your peers, should you go to trial.Under the U.S. Constitution, due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status. Two types of due processThere are two types of due process. Substantive due process determines whether a law violates fundamental rights such as the right to marry or privacy. While these rights are not directly stated in the Constitution, they are so fundamental to human welfare or well-being that we follow them anyway. Procedural due process refers to how laws are carried out in legal proceedings. This includes key protections in the 5th Amendment such as protection against double jeopardy (cannot be tried for the same crime twice), the right against self-incrimination or ""I plead the fifth"" and the right to a grand jury indictment (if you are charged with a crime, a grand jury must determine that there is enough evidence to bring you to a trial). Civil vs. criminal legal proceedingsA civil case usually involves disputes between at least two private parties. In these cases, parties turn to civil court to resolve their disputes. An example of a civil dispute is if one party sues another for a breach of contract. Criminal cases involve actions that harm the state or people, like murder or robbery. Unlike a civil case, where defendants pay monetary damages if convicted, the defendant faces imprisonment in criminal cases.Under the 6th Amendment, which does not directly state due process but aids in the procedures that uphold it, individuals in criminal or civil proceedings have the right to an attorney. In criminal cases, defendants have the right to a public defender, meaning their attorney is paid for by the government. In civil cases, the government is not required to pay for an individual’s attorney. Immigration court is classified as a civil, not criminal. So, although individuals in immigration court have a right to an attorney, the court is not obligated to provide one for them. You might hear a judge say, they have the right to counsel “at no expense to the government.""Some organizations that assist immigrants in need of legal representation are the ACLU, Legal Services Corporation (generally limited to those with legal status), National Lawyers Guild and The Equal Justice Initiative.Violations of due processWhat happens if this constitutional right is violated? Here are some actions that would be considered a violation of your rights:Failure to be heard in courtA biased judgeA prosecutor failing to disclose evidence that suggests a defendant may be innocent of the crimeFailure to be notified before action is takenAn unreasonable delay in legal proceedings Coerced confessions used in courtIf you believe your rights have been violated, Trujillo recommends that you act urgently.""Speak to a lawyer. Immediately speak to a lawyer,"" he says. Document everything pertaining to the alleged violation, report it to the Department of Justice and consider filing a lawsuit. If you cannot afford a lawyer or want to learn more about your options, go to ACLU.org, or contact your local bar association or civil rights organizations that may provide “know your rights” training. Violations can lead to overturned convictions, dismissal of charges or reinstated benefits. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

What is due process?

In simple terms, due process is what it means to have a fair trial. The due process clause, found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, is applied at the federal and state levels. It states that the government must follow certain procedures before depriving a person of their life, liberty or property. These procedures include, but are not limited to:

Providing reasoning for legal action, such as an arrest.

Being granted a chance to challenge any accusations made against you.

Receiving a fair and impartial jury of your peers, should you go to trial.

Under the U.S. Constitution, due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

Two types of due process

There are two types of due process. Substantive due process determines whether a law violates fundamental rights such as the right to marry or privacy. While these rights are not directly stated in the Constitution, they are so fundamental to human welfare or well-being that we follow them anyway.

Procedural due process refers to how laws are carried out in legal proceedings. This includes key protections in the 5th Amendment such as protection against double jeopardy (cannot be tried for the same crime twice), the right against self-incrimination or ""I plead the fifth"" and the right to a grand jury indictment (if you are charged with a crime, a grand jury must determine that there is enough evidence to bring you to a trial).

Civil vs. criminal legal proceedings

A civil case usually involves disputes between at least two private parties. In these cases, parties turn to civil court to resolve their disputes. An example of a civil dispute is if one party sues another for a breach of contract.

Criminal cases involve actions that harm the state or people, like murder or robbery. Unlike a civil case, where defendants pay monetary damages if convicted, the defendant faces imprisonment in criminal cases.

Under the 6th Amendment, which does not directly state due process but aids in the procedures that uphold it, individuals in criminal or civil proceedings have the right to an attorney. In criminal cases, defendants have the right to a public defender, meaning their attorney is paid for by the government. In civil cases, the government is not required to pay for an individual’s attorney.

Immigration court is classified as a civil, not criminal. So, although individuals in immigration court have a right to an attorney, the court is not obligated to provide one for them. You might hear a judge say, they have the right to counsel “at no expense to the government.""

Some organizations that assist immigrants in need of legal representation are the ACLU, Legal Services Corporation (generally limited to those with legal status), National Lawyers Guild and The Equal Justice Initiative.

Violations of due process

What happens if this constitutional right is violated? Here are some actions that would be considered a violation of your rights:

Failure to be heard in court

A biased judge

A prosecutor failing to disclose evidence that suggests a defendant may be innocent of the crime

Failure to be notified before action is taken

An unreasonable delay in legal proceedings

Coerced confessions used in court

If you believe your rights have been violated, Trujillo recommends that you act urgently.

""Speak to a lawyer. Immediately speak to a lawyer,"" he says.

Document everything pertaining to the alleged violation, report it to the Department of Justice and consider filing a lawsuit. If you cannot afford a lawyer or want to learn more about your options, go to ACLU.org, or contact your local bar association or civil rights organizations that may provide “know your rights” training.

Violations can lead to overturned convictions, dismissal of charges or reinstated benefits.

Today, a coalition of researchers and immigrants rights’ and environmental organizations published a new report detailing conditions at Glades County Detention Center (Glades) in Moore Haven, FL, and documenting ongoing, widespread environmental and human rights concerns. This report draws historic parallels between the exploitative sugarcane industry and current carceral land use and documents the jail as a site of environmental and carceral violence. The report examines the years between 2008–2022, when thousands of immigrants spent hundreds of cumulative years detained at Glades, a county jail on the western shore of Lake Okeechobee, close to the Everglades Agricultural Area.

According to the report, the Glades County Detention Center promised jobs and economic development for this rural county. But instead of bringing economic benefit to Glades County, the jail drew from public funds to siphon money to out-of-state bondholders. Rather than generating local prosperity, Glades drained and diverted public money and harmed detained people, who were systematically exposed to environmental hazards.

Through exhaustive documentation, research, and interviews, this report shows three major sources of concern of toxic exposures and human rights abuses at Glades.

Industrial Chemical Disinfectant Misuse: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, two disinfectant sprays were used at Glades: Mint and Maxim Neutral. Both contain antimicrobial quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), a highly toxic industrial pesticide. Both were administered at much higher concentrations than allowable by the manufacturer or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Complaints and testimonies detail that people detained inside Glades experienced painful, burning, red, and swollen eyes, nose, and throat; difficulty breathing, accompanied by sneezing and coughing that sometimes produced blood; severe nausea; stomach pain; and headaches as a direct result of hazardous chemicals being sprayed on them.

Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: In 2021, a carbon monoxide buildup in the Glades County Detention Center kitchen poisoned nine people: six detained kitchen workers and three Glades staff members. The poisoning incident was so severe that four detained men (and at least one Glades Sheriff’s Office employee) were hospitalized following the exposure. Carbon monoxide poisoning is easily preventable, but the Glades detention center lacked a carbon monoxide monitor. The failure to install carbon monoxide monitors was part of a pattern of neglect that rendered the air inside the jail unbreathable.

Pepper Spray: Pepper spray was systematically deployed as a form of punishment, and in retaliation when detained people asked for basic necessities like water and toilet paper. In addition, a series of complaints and legal cases established that pepper spray was disproportionately used against Black people detained at Glades.

Even if detained only for a short time, the negative health impacts on those detained from these toxic exposures can last a lifetime.

The Glades County Detention Center exemplifies a broader trend in Florida: the repurposing of state and local infrastructure, capacities, and resources to criminalize, confine, and punish immigrants. Florida has long been a laboratory for diverting public money and political will away from community needs and towards the criminalization of immigrants. The state has redirected unprecedented public resources toward the surveillance and confinement of immigrants, embedding immigration policing into government at every scale. Beyond Florida, and across the U.S., immigration detention increasingly relies on county jails to detain people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

Guadalupe de la Cruz, Editor and Program Director of AFSC Florida said:

“This report reveals a detention system that dehumanizes people and harms them in profound ways. Glades is not an anomaly; it reflects how immigrant detention inflicts deep and lasting suffering on people and communities. The Glades County Detention Center exemplifies a broader trend in Florida: the repurposing of state and local infrastructure, capacities, and resources to criminalize, confine, and punish immigrants. Florida has long been a laboratory for diverting public money and political will away from community needs and towards the criminalization of immigrants. That is why we are calling on state and local leaders to end their participation in immigrant detention and permanently close the Glades County Detention Center.”

Emma Shaw Crane, lead author and Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University, said, “This report documents widespread and systemic environmental violence at the Glades County Detention Center. Extensive testimony documents that detained people were sprayed with antimicrobial sprays at toxic concentrations, exposed to a disabling carbon monoxide leak, and pepper sprayed as punishment for asking for necessities like water and toilet paper. These hazards made the air inside the jail unbreathable and collectively punished detained people who could not breathe freely inside this facility. When Glades County built this jail, they inadvertently opened a black hole: one that disappeared detained people, who experienced profound environmental violence at Glades, and devoured and diverted public funds, which should have instead been used to support the health and wellbeing of Glades County residents.”

Nanci Palacios Godinez, Organizing and Membership Director at Detention Watch Network, said: “This timely report adds to the overwhelming evidence bank illustrating how immigration detention is inherently inhumane and abusive in Florida and beyond. In no uncertain terms, ICE has repeatedly proven that no one is safe in its custody. This report details the record of abuse at Glades, which exemplifies the realities people face in detention across the country. As the Trump administration continues to ruthlessly pursue detention expansion, including growing ICE partnerships with local sheriffs and county jails, we need real leaders who aren’t afraid to unite against Trump and advocate for the rights and dignity of everyone.”

“This is just one of several immigration detention facilities in Florida in recent years in which we’ve seen a troubling disregard for the health of people detained or the surrounding environment,” said Dominique Burkhardt, Earthjustice attorney. “The courageous effort by advocates and those detained to expose these conditions is vital in an immigration detention system that would otherwise operate as a black box.”

“Led by immigrants detained in Glades County, communities successfully organized to run ICE out of town before, and will do so again,” said Jeff Migliozzi, communications director at Freedom for Immigrants. “As this report makes clear, the Glades County Detention Center will perpetuate the ugliest chapters of U.S. history as long as it remains standing. On top of this facility’s heinous record of brutality and human rights abuses against Black and brown people, immigration detention is a bad deal for local communities. Across the country, there are hundreds of rural counties like Glades in need of healthy and sustainable investments and jobs. And as is the case in so many other places, the promised economic growth from incarceration has not materialized for local residents. The story of Glades County is a potent reminder that our struggle for clean air, good jobs, and freedom are all interconnected.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2026-01-27 12:22:18.713863

""This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,"" Schiltz wrote Monday.","A top federal judge in Minnesota ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to personally appear at a hearing in Minneapolis on Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court after his agency repeatedly violated judicial orders related to immigration enforcement actions.

The three-page order issued late Monday to ICE acting Director Todd Lyons by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz was scathing, accusing federal immigration authorities of failing to comply with ""dozens of court orders"" in recent weeks, including one issued by the judge mandating a bond hearing for a detained immigrant.

""This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,"" Schiltz wrote in the order.

""This Court's patience is at an end,"" Schiltz wrote.

The judge said that the Department of Homeland Security and Lyons' agency, which is a division of DHS, ""have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders,"" and that they would take steps to honor those orders.

""Unfortunately, though, the violations continue,"" Schiltz wrote.

""Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court,"" Schiltz wrote.

CNBC has requested comment from ICE on the order.

The judge called his order ""an extraordinary step.""

""But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,"" Schiltz wrote.

The order comes as Minnesota state officials press for ICE and other federal immigration authorities to cease aggressive actions rounding up undocumented people in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state.

Schiltz's order also came two days after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse on a Minneapolis street, and weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed mom of three Renee Good in her car. Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens.

Those, and other incidents, have sparked widespread outrage in the state and nationally.

The judge's order does not relate to either shooting but to his previous order that DHS and ICE grant a detained immigrant a bond hearing by last Wednesday.

That man remains detained despite Schiltz's directive, according to a court filing by the man's lawyer.

""This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,"" Schiltz wrote Monday.

""The practical consequence of respondents' failure to comply has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong): The detention of an alien is extended, or an alien who should remain in Minnesota is flown to Texas, or an alien who has been flown to Texas is released there and told to figure out a way to get home,"" the judge wrote.

Schiltz said that if, before the hearing, the parties inform him that the detained man ""has been released from custody, the Court will cancel the hearing and will not require Lyons to appear.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108220731-1762195354742-gettyimages-2244371866-AFP_82W4627.jpeg?v=1769528507&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-27 14:59:45.716577

Sources at the US embassy in Rome confirmed a statement from ICE, the agency embroiled in a brutal immigration crackdown in the US, saying that federal agents would support diplomatic security details during the Milan-Cortina games but would not run any enforcement operations.

The statement said: “At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations.

“All security operations remain under Italian authority.”

Speculation in Italy over ICE’s involvement in the Games, which begin on 6 February, had been brewing for days and mounted further on Monday after the president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said on Monday that the US vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would be protected by ICE “bodyguards” at the Olympics.

The speculation fuelled outrage in Italy over ICE’s immigration operations, especially after the fatal shootings this month of the US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

The daily newspaper La Repubblica claimed Italy’s far-right government, which has nurtured friendly relations with Donald Trump’s administration, had briefly looked into blocking the participation of ICE agents in the delegation, but that would have required a departure from how US officials are usually protected during similar high-profile visits abroad.

Milan’s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, told RTL radio that the agents would not be welcome in the city “because they don’t guarantee they’re aligned with our democratic security management methods”.

“This is a militia that kills,” he said. “It’s clear that they are not welcome in Milan, there’s no doubt about it. Can’t we just say no to Trump for once?

“We can take care of their security ourselves. We don’t need ICE.”

Alessandro Zan, a member of the European parliament for the centre-left Democratic party, said the presence of ICE agents would be unacceptable.

“In Italy, we don’t want those who trample on human rights and act outside of any democratic control,” he wrote on X.

Two small opposition parties – the Green and Left Alliance (AVS) and Azione – have started petitions calling on the Italian government and the Olympic organising committee to prevent the ICE agents’ entry and involvement in the security operations.

“ICE is the militia that shoots people on the streets of Minneapolis and takes children away from their families,” AVS said.

Speaking on the sidelines of a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony in Rome, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, sought to play down concerns.

“It’s not like the SS are coming,” he said, referring to the Nazi paramilitary organisation. “Let’s be clear. They’re not coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets.

The decree, expected to come into effect in April, will apply to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and people in Spain with irregular status.
Saiz said the programme, which is being brought in by royal decree meaning it does not require parliamentary approval, would benefit Spain as a whole.
“The key is in managing it well.” The announcement was welcomed by the Brussels-based Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (Picum).
“For thousands of undocumented people who have built their lives in Spain, this could mean dignity, stability and access to basic rights.","Spain’s socialist-led coalition government has approved a decree it said would regularise 500,000 undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, rejecting the anti-migration policies and rhetoric prevalent across much of Europe.

The decree, expected to come into effect in April, will apply to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and people in Spain with irregular status. To qualify for regularisation, applicants will have to prove they do not have a criminal record and had lived in Spain for at least five months – or had sought international protection – before 31 December 2025.

Announcing the decision after Tuesday’s weekly cabinet meeting, Elma Saiz, Spain’s minister for inclusion, social security and migration, said it was a “historic day”, adding the initiative was designed to “break the bureaucratic barriers of the past”.

Saiz said the programme, which is being brought in by royal decree meaning it does not require parliamentary approval, would benefit Spain as a whole. “We’re reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, on integration and on coexistence that’s compatible with both economic growth and social cohesion,” she said.

The decree followed pressure from the socialists’ former allies in the leftwing Podemos party, which has a fraught relationship with the government.

“We reached a deal with the [socialist party] for the extraordinary regularisation of undocumented people,” Podemos’s leader, Ione Belarra, wrote on social media on Tuesday morning. “No one else has to work without rights … Today and always, yes we can!”

In recent years, Spain has become a European outlier on migration. Addressing parliament in October 2024, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country was at a demographic crossroads and needed migration to grow its economy and sustain its welfare state.

“Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations,” he said. “The key is in managing it well.”

The announcement was welcomed by the Brussels-based Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (Picum).

“Today’s decision by the Spanish government to adopt a broad regularisation measure is a powerful reminder that regularisation is not only possible – it works, and it’s the right thing to do,” said Laetitia Van der Vennet, a senior advocacy officer at Picum.

“For thousands of undocumented people who have built their lives in Spain, this could mean dignity, stability and access to basic rights. At a time when a hostile environment against migrants is spreading on both sides of the Atlantic, this move shows both humanity and common sense. We hope more governments will follow this example and invest in policies that protect, empower and include people, and make societies stronger.”

The decision also drew approval from Spain’s Regularisation Now! movement, which added it had come “in an international context marked by the tightening of immigration policies, border closures, and the criminalisation of migrants in much of Europe”.

However, the move has been bitterly criticised by the conservative People’s party (PP) – even though the party ordered similar initiatives when in government – and by the far-right Vox party.

The PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, accused the prime minister of using the announcement to deflect attention from the government’s response to last week’s deadly rail crash, in which at least 45 people died. “Sánchez’s first response is a massive regularisation to distract attention, to increase the pull effect and to overwhelm our public services,” he said. “In socialist Spain, illegality is rewarded.”

Vox, which is rising in the polls and outflanking the PP on the right with an explicitly anti-migrant discourse, went further by using familiar tropes about the great replacement theory and urging the mass deportation of migrants, euphemistically referred to by the far right as “remigration”.

“Five hundred thousand illegals!” said its leader, Santiago Abascal. “Sánchez the tyrant hates the Spanish people. He wants to replace them – that’s why he’s using a decree to promote the pull effect and to accelerate the invasion. He must be stopped. Repatriations, deportations and remigration.”

Regularisation programmes have long been used across the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008. In Spain, nine such programmes have been carried out since the country’s return to democracy, with the PP conducting more regularisation programmes than any other party.

The roots of the current push lie in a citizens’ initiative, signed by more than 700,000 people and backed by about 900 social organisations, presented to parliament in 2024.

Unemployment levels have fallen to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis, and Spain’s economy is outperforming those of its neighbours.

Sánchez hailed the unemployment news in a post on X on Tuesday, saying: “For the first time since 2008, unemployment falls below 10%. Spain has almost 22.5 million people with jobs, a new record.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c8b789e0fd10c68ebc61454599ae37b8afc0e6/0_0_3445_2756/master/3445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42a7d39b8a328ccf291efd7e6cf5176b",N,,2026-01-27 12:22:21.626863

Lawyers for Minnesota and the governments of the Twin Cities argued that the surge is violating the 10th Amendment, which protects states from encroachment by the federal government.
“They’re trying to hijack the state’s legislative process,” Brian Carter, a lawyer with the Minnesota Attorney General’s office, said of the Trump administration.
She also challenged the state’s lawyers about when a federal law enforcement operation would become so large or oppressive that it would amount to a 10th Amendment violation.","Menendez declined to rule on the matter immediately and seemed to agonize over how to draw a line between legitimate federal law enforcement and an unconstitutional incursion on Minnesota’s sovereignty. Complicating the matter were signals of deescalation by Trump, who spoke Monday with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and suggested they were on the same “wavelength” about the way forward.

“Not all crises have a fix from a district court injunction,” the Biden-appointed judge said. “It must be that work is being done elsewhere … not just counting on a single district court issuing a single injunction.”

But the judge faced demands from Minnesota’s leaders to act quickly, in light of the killing Friday of VA nurse Alex Pretti by a federal agent, amid an escalating federal presence.

“We ask the court to issue a [restraining order] today,” said Lindsey Middlecamp, a lawyer for the state. “Not tomorrow. Not next week, but today.”

During the nearly three-hour hearing in Minneapolis federal court, the judge repeatedly focused on Trump’s vow on social media earlier this month to bring “a day of reckoning and retribution” to Minnesota, and on a Saturday letter from Bondi to Walz that appeared to set conditions for the administration to wind down the surge. Lawyers for the state described Bondi’s missive as a “shakedown” and a “ransom note.”

While one of Bondi’s demands involved access to immigrants being released from state jails and prisons, two others seemed to link the surge to issues not related directly to immigration enforcement such as fraud in the SNAP program, better known as food stamps, and a dispute over the Trump administration’s demand for access to Minnesota’s voter rolls.

Lawyers for Minnesota and the governments of the Twin Cities argued that the surge is violating the 10th Amendment, which protects states from encroachment by the federal government. The provision has been held both to prevent the federal government from “commandeering” local officials and from using coercion to force a state to comply with federal demands.

“They’re trying to hijack the state’s legislative process,” Brian Carter, a lawyer with the Minnesota Attorney General’s office, said of the Trump administration. “They’re trying to get us to turn over voter rolls. What does that have to do [with immigration?] The federal government is attempting to bend the state’s will to its own and that is not allowed under the Constitution.”

Lawyers for the state also complained that the surge seemed intended to sideline the courts by forcing the state to knuckle under on matters that are currently being litigated.

“This administration … is not content with the rule of law,” Carter said. “They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. Instead, they put violence into the streets of Minnesota to get what they want. That has to violate the 10th amendment.”

Menendez seemed to accept some aspects of the state’s case, but expressed concerns about how to fashion an order that would end the surge without tying the federal government’s hands to carry out more traditional immigration enforcement. She also challenged the state’s lawyers about when a federal law enforcement operation would become so large or oppressive that it would amount to a 10th Amendment violation.

Justice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said the surge wasn’t a form of retaliation but instead a response to lawlessness engendered by the state and local policies.

“The state cannot use the 10th Amendment as a shield and say, ‘We’re not going to help you,’ and then when we come to enforce federal immigration law, then turn around and say, ‘The 10th Amendment would actually prevent you from [doing that.]’ That would turn federalism on its head,” Mayers said. “We are here because of this law enforcement vacuum.”

Menendez pressed Mayers for a tally of the number of federal officers involved in the surge, which has been estimated at 3,000 to 4,000 people. The attorney said he didn’t have a current number but would provide one to the court.

Acting in a separate lawsuit earlier this month brought by anti-immigration-enforcement protesters and observers, Menendez issued an order barring Homeland Security agents from using chemical irritants against peaceful protesters. Her order was quickly paused by a federal appeals court.

Menendez made no promise Monday about when she would rule on the state’s request for a broader restraining order ending the surge, but made clear the case is now her highest priority.

“I’m so confused, why on earth would ICE agents come to Italy?","Outrage is growing in Italy over the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to assist US security operations at the Winter Olympics next month.

Current and former lawmakers have urged Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to intervene to block the agents’ presence in the wake of two fatal shootings during an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the reports in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.

ICE will serve “a security role” at the Olympics, a DHS spokesperson said. “They don’t do immigration enforcement (operations) in a foreign country obviously,” the spokesperson said.

The agency is “supporting” the US diplomatic security service at the Games, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin added later Tuesday, saying that, “All security operations remain under Italian authority.”

“At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,” McLaughlin told CNN in a statement.

Federal agencies have supported security for US diplomats in previous Olympics, including Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of ICE, a State Department spokesperson told CNN on background. The State Department also specified that its Diplomatic Security Service is leading security effort in Milan.

Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi met with US Ambassador Tilman Fertitta on Tuesday, according to the Interior Ministry, which confirmed that ICE’s investigative arm, not the operational arm, will be present at the Milan-Cortina Olympics. “The agency will work exclusively within their diplomatic missions and not on the ground,” the ministry said in a social media post.

“It is important to reiterate that Homeland Security Investigation investigators will not be represented by operational personnel like those engaged in immigration controls in the US, but by representatives exclusively specialized in investigations,” the ministry added.

Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, sought to placate his colleagues’ concerns over the use of ICE by the US diplomatic security detail, following increasingly aggressive tactics by the agency in the US.

“Let’s be clear: it’s not like they’re coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets. They’re coming to collaborate in the operations rooms,” Tajani told Italian radio station RAI on Tuesday.

“It’s not like they’re the ones on the streets of Minneapolis,” the foreign minister said. “It’s not like the SS are coming.

“The problem isn’t that those with machine guns are coming with their faces covered. They’re coming from a specific unit. They’re coming because it’s the unit responsible for counterterrorism,” Tajani added.

‘A militia that kills’

The former Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged the country’s government to “set our own limits” and “make clear decisions.”

“After street violence and murders in the US, we now learn from their spokesperson that ICE agents will come to Italy to ensure security at the Milan-Cortina Olympics,” Conte posted on X on Tuesday, referring to reports quoting ICE in Italian media.

“We cannot allow this,” he added. “Our government tried to downplay the situation, but these latest statements speak clearly of ICE’s determination to come and ensure ‘security’ in Italy as well. Enough with the bowing,” Conte added.

That same day, the Mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, declared that authorities “don’t need ICE” to implement security at the Olympics, telling local radio, “They’re not welcome in Milan.”

“This is a militia that kills,” Sala told Italian radio station RTL 102.5 on Tuesday. “Could we ever say ‘No’ to Trump? This isn’t about severing relations or creating a diplomatic incident, but could we say ‘No?’”

“I believe they shouldn’t come to Italy because they don’t guarantee they’re aligned with our democratic security management methods,” added Sala.

Another Italian lawmaker warned ICE agents “must not set foot in Italy.” “It is a violent, unprepared, and out-of-control militia,” Carlo Calenda, a veteran politician, told RTL 102.5 on Tuesday.

Over the weekend, Italian media reports of ICE’s deployment to the northern city of Milan drew criticism and prompted petitions, amid increased scrutiny over the jurisdiction and force leveraged by immigration officers in the US.

In recent weeks, ICE federal law enforcement agents killed two US citizens in the city of Minneapolis – against the backdrop of intensified protests demanding a halt to sweeping immigration raids by the White House.

Several Americans living in Milan reacted to the move by US authorities with incredulity, expressing concern over their country’s reputation on the world stage under US President Donald Trump’s domestic and foreign policy agenda. They spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.

“I’m so confused, why on earth would ICE agents come to Italy? They don’t have jurisdiction here,” one person said on Tuesday.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256091466.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-27 13:59:16.911892

Get the Facts: What is due process?

Due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

In the United States, due process is meant to safeguard against government overreach. The clause states that no state may deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of the law. The concept dates back to the Magna Carta of 1215, and due process remains at the core of the U.S. Constitution.

This week, the chief federal judge in Minnesota said the Trump administration failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him on Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

What is due process?

In simple terms, due process is what it means to have a fair trial. The due process clause, found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, is applied at the federal and state levels. It states that the government must follow certain procedures before depriving a person of their life, liberty or property. These procedures include, but are not limited to:

Providing reasoning for legal action, such as an arrest.

Being granted a chance to challenge any accusations made against you.

Receiving a fair and impartial jury of your peers, should you go to trial.

Under the U.S. Constitution, due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

Two types of due process

There are two types of due process. Substantive due process determines whether a law violates fundamental rights such as the right to marry or privacy. While these rights are not directly stated in the Constitution, they are so fundamental to human welfare or well-being that we follow them anyway.

Procedural due process refers to how laws are carried out in legal proceedings. This includes key protections in the 5th Amendment such as protection against double jeopardy (cannot be tried for the same crime twice), the right against self-incrimination or ""I plead the fifth"" and the right to a grand jury indictment (if you are charged with a crime, a grand jury must determine that there is enough evidence to bring you to a trial).

Civil vs. criminal legal proceedings

A civil case usually involves disputes between at least two private parties. In these cases, parties turn to civil court to resolve their disputes. An example of a civil dispute is if one party sues another for a breach of contract.

Criminal cases involve actions that harm the state or people, like murder or robbery. Unlike a civil case, where defendants pay monetary damages if convicted, the defendant faces imprisonment in criminal cases.

Under the 6th Amendment, which does not directly state due process but aids in the procedures that uphold it, individuals in criminal or civil proceedings have the right to an attorney. In criminal cases, defendants have the right to a public defender, meaning their attorney is paid for by the government. In civil cases, the government is not required to pay for an individual’s attorney.

Immigration court is classified as a civil, not criminal. So, although individuals in immigration court have a right to an attorney, the court is not obligated to provide one for them. You might hear a judge say, they have the right to counsel “at no expense to the government.""

Some organizations that assist immigrants in need of legal representation are the ACLU, Legal Services Corporation (generally limited to those with legal status), National Lawyers Guild and The Equal Justice Initiative.

Violations of due process

What happens if this constitutional right is violated? Here are some actions that would be considered a violation of your rights:

Failure to be heard in court

A biased judge

A prosecutor failing to disclose evidence that suggests a defendant may be innocent of the crime

Failure to be notified before action is taken

An unreasonable delay in legal proceedings

Coerced confessions used in court

If you believe your rights have been violated, Trujillo recommends that you act urgently.

""Speak to a lawyer. Immediately speak to a lawyer,"" he says.

Document everything pertaining to the alleged violation, report it to the Department of Justice and consider filing a lawsuit. If you cannot afford a lawyer or want to learn more about your options, go to ACLU.org, or contact your local bar association or civil rights organizations that may provide “know your rights” training.

Violations can lead to overturned convictions, dismissal of charges or reinstated benefits.

Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.","A growing number of Republicans are questioning or criticizing the Trump administration's response to the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.

The criticism has extended beyond the handful of Republicans who are known for periodically differing from President Trump. Some Trump allies are also among those questioning immigration agents' tactics or the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting. At minimum, they are calling for an investigation into Pretti's shooting.

GOP lawmakers accuse Trump administration of rushing to judgment

Some Republicans have chafed at the fact that top Trump administration officials almost immediately argued the shooting was justified and accused Pretti of threatening federal agents.

Hours after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged Pretti ""approached"" Border Patrol agents with a gun and ""violently resisted"" after officers tried to disarm him. But videos show Pretti was holding up a cellphone, not his gun, when he was approached by agents. Pretti was being held on the ground when an officer appeared to remove a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a ""would-be assassin"" and a ""domestic terrorist,"" without offering any evidence, and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino accused Pretti of trying to ""massacre law enforcement."" Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry. He had no criminal record.

GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on his podcast that the Trump administration could improve ""the tone with which they're describing this.""

""Escalating the rhetoric doesn't help, and it actually loses credibility,"" the senator said on Monday's episode of ""Verdict with Ted Cruz."" ""And so I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy and to say, we don't want anyone, anyone's lives, to be lost, and the politicians who are pouring gasoline on this fire, they need to stop.""

Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah specifically criticized Noem.

""I disagree with Secretary Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,"" Curtis wrote on X, calling for a ""transparent, independent investigation"" and for ""those responsible"" to be ""held accountable.""

GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said administration officials rushing to judgment and trying to ""shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.""

Focus on Pretti's gun frustrates some Republicans

A few Trump administration officials have highlighted the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a handgun before he was shot — drawing pushback from gun rights groups and their traditional GOP allies in Congress.

Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, argued on X that law enforcement is often ""legally justified"" in shooting someone who approaches with a gun. And FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that ""no one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines.""

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested the FBI was ""adopting every leftist gun-banner talking point"" and said Essayli may not be fit for the job.

""Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,"" Massie said.

Essayli's comments were also criticized by the National Rifle Association, which called them ""dangerous and wrong.""

Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he also supports ""a full and impartial investigation"" into Pretti's death, and pointed specifically to gun rights.

""His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,"" he said.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana wrote, seemingly in response to the shooting: ""Your Second Amendment rights don't disappear when you exercise your other rights. The Constitution is crystal clear: 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.'""

Shooting described as ""shocking"" and ""disturbing""

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called Pretti's killing ""shocking"" and said it should ""raise serious questions"" about ""the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.""

Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge this year, wrote on X: ""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska called the shooting a ""horrifying situation.""

""My support for funding ICE remains the same. Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security. But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble,"" said Ricketts. ""I expect a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident.""

And GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said he's ""troubled by the events that have unfolded.""

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called Pretti's death a ""real tragedy"" in an interview on CNN. He argued most Americans want Mr. Trump to address immigration, but urged the administration to define its ""endgame,"" which he said can't be to ""deport every single non-U.S. citizen.""

""I think the death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,"" he said. ""Americans don't like what they're seeing right now.""

When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked on a talk radio show about ICE's rocky approval ratings, the Trump-allied governor said the White House should ""recalibrate"" and ""maybe work from a different direction.""

He said immigration agencies should ""go about their job in a more structured way to make sure that they are going to remove these people without causing all the kinds of problems and fighting in communities that they are experiencing right now.""

Chris Madel, a Republican who was running for Minnesota governor, ended his bid on Monday. He cited the administration's immigration crackdown in the state as an ""unmitigated disaster.""

""United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That's unconstitutional and it's wrong,"" he said.

In his announcement, Madel noted he has provided legal advice to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.

GOP Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania called for a ""full investigation"" and said that ""we must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust.""

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she's ""appalled at the violence in Minneapolis"" before turning her attention to an impending fight over a bill to fund DHS for the rest of the fiscal year. She noted that the bill includes funding for body-warn cameras, law enforcement de-escalation training and more oversight for detention facilities — provisions she said ""would make such incidents less likely to occur.""

In the wake of Pretti's death, a growing list of Senate Democrats have said they won't vote for the DHS funding bill unless changes are made, posing a problem for lawmakers' plan to bundle it with five other funding bills that have already passed the House. If the Senate doesn't pass that package of bills by the end of the day Friday, a partial government shutdown will begin.

Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation

Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.

Patel has said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch will lead a federal probe into the shooting. Current and former agency officials told CBS News that approach is unusual since it tasks ICE with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.

Meanwhile, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have requested that the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services appear before the panels in the coming weeks.

The letters, sent by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Andrew Gabarino of New York, did not mention the killings of Pretti and Good, but would provide a chance for lawmakers to question officials about the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.

""As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,"" Paul said in the letters, which were dated Monday. ""Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people.""

Noem, meanwhile, is expected to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 3, according to a spokesperson for GOP Sen.

Paul KirbyEurope digital editor

The US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in two fatal shootings in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.

Confirmation of the agency's role came from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy.

""This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan,"" the city's mayor, Beppe Sala, told Italian radio on Tuesday.

An ICE spokesperson stressed that ""all security operations remain under Italian authority"".

US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if the customs and enforcement agency had itself taken part.

The agency's statement on Tuesday explained that ""ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations"".

It would ""obviously"" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, it said.

Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: ""I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.""

But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets.

In the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot on the streets of Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.

The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.

The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide ""yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump"".

The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that ""ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory"".

The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Other judges in Minnesota have been raising alarms for weeks. U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, a Bill Clinton appointee, similarly accused the administration of “an undeniable move … to defy court orders or at least to stretch the legal process to the breaking point in an attempt to deny noncitizens their due process rights.”

Several of Schiltz’s colleagues are weighing broader lawsuits that would sharply curtail federal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota or end Operation Metro Surge altogether. Those lawsuits gained new urgency last week after the shooting death of Alex Pretti by federal officers.

Minnesota also went to court to preserve evidence from the Saturday shooting of Alex Pretti after its own investigators were blocked from the scene by federal authorities.

Experts say the line being drawn between Minnesota and the U.S. government goes against years of cooperation between local and federal agencies on law enforcement missions.

But they also said the state’s hand has been forced by an administration that has acted against decades of practice — from declining to allow state officials access to evidence gathered by federal authorities to barring its own Civil Rights division from probing the shootings of Pretti and Renee Good, who was shot to death by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7.

Former federal prosecutors under Republican and Democratic presidential administrations said the divide was deeply troubling, though a call Monday between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and President Donald Trump may signal a way forward after both expressed that progress was made.

An unusual website launch

The Minnesota Department of Corrections launched a website its leaders said was dedicated to combatting Department of Homeland Security misinformation after Pretti was killed. The site includes examples where Minnesota officials honored federal requests to hold people under deportation orders to refute the Trump administration claim that those people are routinely allowed to go free.

Department officials also published videos showing peaceful transfers of custody from prison to federal authorities of several individuals the Trump administration had claimed were arrested by immigration agents as part of the ongoing immigration enforcement action.

The department also issued a news release trying to dispel federal claims about the criminal records of people sought by federal agents, including the person at the center of an operation Saturday near where Pretti was shot. The release said the department never had custody of the man and could only find decade-old misdemeanor traffic-related violations. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino had said at a news conference Saturday that the man had a significant criminal history.

Jimmy Gurulé, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said he saw turf battles and other disagreements when he was a federal prosecutor working with local authorities on task forces in Los Angeles, and again when he was an undersecretary at the U.S. Treasury Department overseeing law enforcement operations under George W. Bush. But, he said, the situation in Minnesota is “unprecedented” in his experience.

“The disagreements were always handled behind the scenes. There were never any public statements criticizing other agencies,” Gurulé said.

“It’s not even a question of collaboration at this point. It’s such a broken relationship,” he said. “How did it get to this point, where state and local law enforcement have such little trust in the federal agencies they feel they need to go to court?”

Seeking relief in court

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit in federal court after the shooting Saturday seeking to preserve evidence collected by federal officials from the Pretti shooting. A federal judge granted a motion blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence.”

Federal officials called the lawsuit and claims the federal government would destroy evidence “ridiculous.”

But state officials are not alone in having concern over a departure from decades of standard practice, which has been the Department of Justice and its Civil Rights Division investigating the constitutionality of an officer’s use of force, especially when fatal. DHS officials have instead said their own department would investigate the two Minneapolis shootings.

“What you would expect in normal times is the Justice Department would open an investigation into the circumstances of the shooting,” said Chris Mattei, a former federal prosecutor in Connecticut under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “They have been the independent body that would investigate it. But it would seem that this Justice Department and this Civil Rights division have zero interest in enforcing constitutional rights for citizens in the immigration context.”

Mattei, now a partner at the Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder law firm that represents several former FBI employees in lawsuits over their terminations, said under Trump it appears the justice department doesn’t want to change the wide latitude agents have been given to conduct immigration enforcement.

“These are career investigators,” he said. “They may have different opinions on how to pursue an investigation or how certain evidence should be handled. But usually in my experience they have the same objective to conduct a credible investigation.”

Gurulé called the state lawsuit, specifically the motion over preserving evidence, “shocking.”

“The implication was they are not just keeping evidence from them but possibly destroying it,” he said. “Clearly the state attorney general and the Minneapolis police have grave distrust with ICE and DHS. Clearly there are strong disagreements with the tactics that ICE has used.”

Signs reconciliation might be possible

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt Monday moved to distance President Trump from statements made by deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller characterizing Pretti as an assassin, saying the situation had moved quickly since Saturday and noting Trump had never used those words.

Gurulé said statements like that erode the public’s confidence that investigations are impartial.

“You don’t express your conclusion before an investigation and make it public. That is unheard of and upside down,” he said.

In his call with Trump, Walz’s office said the governor made the case for an impartial investigation of the shootings and that Trump had agreed to talk to DHS about ensuring state investigators would be able to conduct an independent investigation.

Trump and Walz also discussed working in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement. The governor’s office reiterated the state would continue honoring requests to hold incarcerated individuals who are not U.S. citizens until federal authorities can take them into custody.

No matter where you stand on immigration enforcement, the shootings show that what the country has been doing is not working.

The loudest voices on each extreme have retreated to their usual corners. They have an interest in keeping our immigration problems unsolved and politically divisive. Everyone else must see that Congress and the president need to embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy that acknowledges Americans’ many legitimate concerns about how the government has conducted immigration policy.

That starts with reviewing how we got here. During President Joe Biden’s term, lenient border policies and foolish state and local laws offering shelter and benefits to illegal immigrants resulted in millions of migrants entering the United States, overwhelming our cities, our legal and public education systems, and our social safety net.

Americans demanded action, electing Donald Trump in 2024. Now, just months from the November midterm elections, polls suggest that Americans are increasingly concerned about the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement operations, including in Minneapolis. Americans do not want chaos. They want a common-sense bipartisan solution.

During the Biden and Trump administrations I have helped write bills with anyone from any party who would collaborate with me on finding that solution. A workable plan requires a secure border. Thankfully, the Trump administration has effectively stopped illegal border crossings and deported, by its own count, over 675,000 illegal immigrants. Any balanced immigration policy would preserve and expand on this progress — but humanely.

Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are conducting forceful operations in American communities. They should reassess their current tactics.

Irresponsible politicians have increased the danger by delegitimizing ICE — with some calling to abolish it — and standing behind sanctuary city policies that restrict necessary cooperation between immigration enforcement officers and state and local police. Local police departments are better suited to interact with the public. Collaboration among federal, state and local law enforcement officials might have prevented some of the chaos in Minneapolis.

Collaboration should start now. The F.B.I. and state and local departments should together investigate the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. A transparent and accountable process that protects the rights of everyone involved, including the deceased and their families, would ensure all relevant evidence is collected and bolster the public’s confidence in immigration enforcement and our justice system.

Congressional scrutiny would help, too. Lawmakers should immediately convene hearings with the leadership of Homeland Security, ICE, the Border Patrol and Citizenship and Immigration Services — not to provide a platform for partisan grandstanding, but to promote an honest national conversation about immigration enforcement.

After tensions have calmed, Congress can then piece together the rest of an immigration plan that settles the issue. Along with building on Mr. Trump’s border policies, a realistic plan would provide a path to legal status — not citizenship — for long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records. This path would be rigorous and fair, and it would aim to keep families together. Fair means those who benefit would face mandatory work requirements, forgo public assistance and pay fines and any back taxes they might owe.

Congress would have to change the legal immigration system, too. Lawmakers should create a system in which applicants’ merit matters more than it does now, better accounting for the country’s economic needs. I am the husband of a naturalized citizen. My wife came to the United States in pursuit of a better life. I will always fight to provide opportunity to others who have the potential and desire to contribute to America’s success.

We must be a nation of laws but also one that offers dignity and compassion to those seeking to pursue their American dream. The events of the past several years show that there will be no Democratic or Republican solution on immigration, only an American one.

After 40 years of failure — and, now, two more deaths that did not need to occur — my colleagues and I should feel only more profoundly the responsibility to rebuild trust and act in America’s common interest.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27lawler-gvbq/27lawler-gvbq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:21:25.444647

At least six immigrants have died in the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency already in 2026, and a seventh person was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE officer.

Last year, 32 deaths were reported in ICE custody.

While most of the deaths were due to health complications, some of the late detainees’ families have made accusations of abuse and medical neglect against ICE.

Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, was killed by immigration officers on Saturday morning in Minneapolis. Good was shot on January 7, also in Minneapolis, after she tried to drive away from federal agents who surrounded her car.

Here are the stories of the others whose death is linked to immigration law enforcement:

Keith Porter

On New Year’s Eve, an off-duty ICE agent shot Porter, 43, to death in Los Angeles.

The exact circumstances of the shooting remain contested, and there are no known videos of the incident.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described Porter – who was Black – as an “active shooter”, but his family insists that he was merely firing his gun to welcome the new year, which is an illegal but widely observed US tradition.

“No parent should ever have to bury their child, and the pain of this loss is something I would not wish on anyone,” Porter’s mother, Franceola Armstrong, said in a statement on an online fundraiser.

“My son leaves behind two beautiful daughters, ages 10 and 20. They were his heart. Everything he did, every plan he made, was for them.”

No charges have been filed in the case.

DHS has pushed to justify the shooting, accusing Porter of shooting at the officer.

The department said the agent went outside his apartment complex to investigate the sound of gunshots, and when he encountered Porter, he ordered him to drop his weapon.

“When the subject refused to comply, the officer fired defensively with his service weapon at the subject to disarm him. The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The ICE agent was not harmed in the incident.

Porter’s family lawyer has raised questions over the DHS account, calling for evidence that the slain father of two fired at the officer.

Jamal Tooson, the lawyer, also criticised the ICE agent for confronting Porter with his weapon instead of involving the local police, who are well-trained and familiar with the community.

“Had he just stayed in his apartment for five minutes, Keith would be with us,” Tooson said in a news conference.

Geraldo Lunas Campos

Earlier this month, ICE announced that Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on January 3 at the agency’s largest detention facility – Camp East Montana in Texas.

Since then, contradicting details have emerged about his death, which a medical examiner has ruled as a homicide – meaning caused by another person.

ICE initially said Lunas Campos “became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm” and was placed in segregation.

He then became distressed, according to the agency.

“Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services. Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS,” ICE said in a January 9 statement.

The agency repeatedly highlighted Lunas Campos’s criminal record.

The authorities later changed their own story, claiming that Lunas Campos tried to kill himself.

“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS’s McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”

But an autopsy report found that Linas Campos was killed by someone.

“Based on the investigative and examination findings, it is my opinion that the cause of death is asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,” Adam Gonzalez, deputy medical examiner for El Paso County, said in the report, according to The Washington Post.

“The manner of death is homicide.”

Lunas Campos’ three children have filed a legal petition aiming to block the deportation of any detainees who may have witnessed the incident, as they prepare to file a wrongful death lawsuit.

“According to an eyewitness to Mr Lunas Campos’s death, guards at the facility choked him to death,” the petition said.

Victor Manuel Diaz

Immigration authorities arrested Nicaraguan immigrant Victor Manuel Diaz on January 6 in Minneapolis as part of their immigration crackdown in Minnesota. Eight days later, he died in ICE custody at Camp East Montana in Texas.

“Contract security staff found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room,” ICE said in a statement. “He died of a presumed suicide; however, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.”

But Diaz’s family is questioning the government’s story.

“I don’t believe he took his life,” Diaz’s brother Yorlan told ABC News. “He was not a criminal; he was looking for a better life and he wanted to help our mother.”

The family has also raised concerns over how the authorities are handling the investigation.

According to several US media reports, Diaz’s body was transferred to William Beaumont Army Medical Center for an autopsy, instead of the county medical examiner.

“This, taking of the body and doing the autopsy report and not letting the medical examiner do it? You’re then having the fox guarding the henhouse,” Randall Kallinen, the family’s lawyer, told the local outlet KTSM.

“It was with the federal government where the individual was staying and where he was killed. And now it’s the federal government who is controlling the investigation and the information included in the autopsy report.”

Parady La

Cambodian immigrant Parady La, 46, had been in the US since 1981. He had come to the US legally as a child but lost his Green Card due to criminal convictions.

Immigration authorities arrested him on January 6 and sent him to the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in Philadelphia, where he started experiencing “severe drug withdrawal” symptoms, according to ICE.

“The next day, La was found unresponsive in his cell. FDC officers immediately administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance,” the US agency said.

NARCAN is a drug used for people experiencing a drug overdose, not withdrawals.

La was transferred to a hospital and diagnosed with “anoxic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest, shock and multiple organ failures” before he died, ICE said.

But La’s family is voicing scepticism about the level of care he received.

His nephew, Michael La, said ICE’s version of the events leading to his uncle’s death “didn’t add up”.

“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” Michael La told local public radio WHYY. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”

Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz

A father of three, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, had been in the US for more than 20 years when ICE picked him up in New Jersey in November and transferred him to a detention centre in California.

He died on January 6 of “heart-related health issues” after being transferred to a hospital.

But his family has said that he was feeling ill for weeks and was only given pain medication.

“As a father, he was an excellent dad,” his daughter, Josselyn Yanez, told the news website northjersey.com. “As a grandfather, the best grandfather of all. We hoped our father would get out of that place, that he would come out alive – not the way he did.”

Heber Sanchez Dominguez

Seven days after ICE picked up Heber Sanchez Dominguez, the 34-year-old Mexican national was found dead in his cell at the Robert A Deyton (RAD) Detention Facility in Georgia on January 14.

“RAD medical staff discovered Sanchaz (sic) hanging by the neck and unresponsive in his sleeping quarters at approximately 2:05 am,” ICE said in a statement.

The lack of details has prompted calls for investigation, including from Mexican officials.

Sanchez Dominguez was arrested in Georgia for driving without a licence before being transferred to ICE custody.

“In coordination with the relevant US authorities, the Consulate General has requested that the circumstances of the incident be clarified and is cooperating in the necessary steps to ensure that the investigation is carried out promptly and transparently,” Mexico’s consulate in Atlanta said after Sanchez Dominguez’s death.

The Clayton County Democratic Committee in Georgia also called on state officials to push for an investigation.

“We further demand the immediate release of all records and documentation related to Mr. Sanchez Dominguez’s detention, medical treatment, and the events leading up to his death. Transparency is not optional, it is a moral and legal obligation,” the group said in a statement.

Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres

ICE has said that Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, a 42-year-old immigrant from Honduras, died on January 5 at a hospital in Houston, Texas, after being admitted for “chronic heart-related health issues”.

Nunez did not have a criminal record, but he had entered the country irregularly. ICE nabbed him during an immigration enforcement operation in November 2025 and transferred him to the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas.

“ICE is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments,” the agency said in a statement, after Nunez’s death.

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-27T014324Z_1431659653_RC249JAB28MK_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1769510651.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-27 13:03:22.465593

Last Saturday in Minneapolis, a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, during an altercation between federal immigration officials and protestors.

In a statement immediately following the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security said Pretti was shot after he “approached” Border Patrol officers with a handgun.

According to the Associated Press, Pretti is the sixth person to die during the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign in the U.S.

VA Secretary Doug Collins confirmed on Sunday that Pretti was a nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center.

“As President Trump has said, nobody wants to see chaos and death in American cities, and we send our condolences to the Pretti family. Such tragedies are unfortunately happening in Minnesota because of state and local officials’ refusal to cooperate with the federal government to enforce the law and deport dangerous illegal criminals,” Collins wrote.

VA employees expressed outrage over Pretti’s death. Coworkers remembered him as someone who cared deeply for his patients.

An internal document obtained by Federal News Network shows that Pretti recently received a “VA gratitude” email message from his supervisors.

“Thanks for staying on your day off and helping out taking care of the veterans,” the email to Pretti states. “You are an invaluable member of the team!”

“Alex Pretti was a great nurse and researcher,” a VA employee told Federal News Network on Saturday.

Doug Massey, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 17, which represents VA Central Office employees, said members are “generally upset and very concerned following” the shooting. Massey said it was a “senseless” shooting, and that Pretti was trying to assist a protester on the ground moments before the shooting.

“I know a lot of nurses, and they tend to be that type where they like to help people. He saw the woman getting pushed down,” Massey said.

Daniel Amyx, a rehab and extended care nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, said he spoke with some of Pretti’s ICU coworkers following the shooting, and that they described him as “very kind and gentle,” and a “great guy to work with.”

“Alex was a dedicated nurse. He was science-minded, evidenced by the fact that he moved from research into becoming a nurse, and I heard that he very much cared for his patients,” Amyx said in a virtual meeting hosted by the Federal Unionists Network on Sunday. Amyx said the Minneapolis VAMC is planning a memorial service for Pretti.

Sharda Fornnarino, a VA registered nurse in Colorado and secretary of the VA division for National Nurses United, called Pretti’s death a “blatant attack on federal workers.”

“VA workers, we’re shocked, stunned and now we’re getting angry,” Fornnarino said.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the shooting a “tragedy,” during a briefing with reporters on Monday, but said it “occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.”

“This incident remains under investigation and nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives in American streets,” Leavitt said.

Matthew Silverman, national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said in a statement that “respect for lawful authority and adherence to the rule of law are essential to preventing further tragedies.”

“In an era of rising threats against law enforcement, it is critical that officers are supported, not second-guessed in real time, as they carry out their duties under extraordinary pressure,” Silverman said.

Before the shooting, a comprehensive spending deal for the rest of fiscal 2026 was slated for a full Senate vote. But following Pretti’s death, Senate Democrats are calling on the Senate to pull DHS funding from the six-bill package.

This package currently includes the full-year funding bills for DHS and the departments of Defense, Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services, State, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, as well as several other agencies. The House of Representatives approved these six bills last week.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), ranking member of the Senate Appropriation Committee’s subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, called on the Senate to pull the DHS funding bill from the final package of spending bills for the rest of fiscal 2026.

Van Hollen told Federal Drive with Terry Gerton that this would allow lawmakers to “dive in and make necessary changes to the Department of Homeland Security budget.”

“There’s no reason that Republicans should hold all of those bills hostage as we work to rein in and dramatically reform the parts of DHS that need to be dramatically reined in. That will be the question — whether or not Republicans in the Senate are willing to do that,” Van Hollen said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Monday that Senate Democrats plan to advance five of the spending bills, separately from the DHS funding bill, before the Jan. 30 deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown.

“The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,” Schumer said in a statement.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-Maine) urged her colleagues on Monday to vote for the full six-bill package that includes DHS funding, to “show that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to finish the job.”

“It is so important that we do so, because looming is a government shutdown — another harmful, unnecessary and disastrous government shutdown if we do not complete our work,” Collins said on the Senate floor.

Collins said more than 80% of the DHS spending bill covers non-immigration and non-border security functions — such as cybersecurity and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration.

Democrats have awakened to what they see as a moral moment for the country, refusing funds for the Department of Homeland Security's military-style immigration enforcement operations unless there are new restraints. Two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, have broken from retirement to speak out.

At the same time, Republicans who have championed President Donald Trump's tough approach to immigration are signaling second thoughts. A growing number of Republicans want a full investigation into the shooting death of Alex Pretti and congressional hearings about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

“Americans are horrified & don’t want their tax dollars funding this brutality,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., wrote on social media. “Not another dime to this lawless operation.”

The result is a rapidly changing political environment as the nation considers the reach of the Trump administration's well-funded immigration enforcement machinery and Congress spirals toward a partial federal shutdown if no resolution is reached by midnight Friday.

“The tragic death of Alex Pretti has refocused attention on the Homeland Security bill, and I recognize and share the concerns,"" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the GOP chair of the Appropriations Committee, in brief remarks Monday.

Still, she urged colleagues to stick to the funding deal and avoid a “detrimental shutdown.”

Searching for a way out of a crisis

As Congress seeks to defuse a crisis, the next steps are uncertain.

The White House has indicated its own shifting strategy, sending Trump's border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis to take over for hard-charging Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, which many Republicans see as a potential turning point to calm operations.

“This is a positive development — one that I hope leads to turning down the temperature and restoring order in Minnesota,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune posted about Homan.

Behind the scenes, the White House is reaching out to congressional leaders, and even individual Democratic senators, in search of a way out of another government shutdown.

At stake is a six-bill government funding package, not just for Homeland Security but for Defense, Health and other departments, making up more than 70% of federal operations.

Even though Homeland Security has billions from Trump's big tax break bill, Democrats are coalescing around changes to ICE operations. ""We can still have some legitimate restriction on how these people are conducting themselves,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.

But it appears doubtful the Trump administration would readily agree to Democrats' demands to rein in immigration operations. Proposals for unmasking federal agents or limiting their reach into schools, hospitals or churches would be difficult to quickly approve in Congress.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that while conversations are underway, Trump wants to see the bipartisan spending package approved to avoid the possibility of a government shutdown.

“We absolutely do not want to see that funding lapse,” Leavitt said.

Politics reflect changing attitudes on Trump's immigration agenda

The political climate is a turnaround from just a year ago, when Congress easily passed the Laken Riley Act, the first bill Trump signed into law in his second term.

At the time, dozens of Democrats joined the GOP majority in passing the bill named after a Georgia nursing student who was killed by a Venezuelan man who had entered the country illegally.

Many Democrats had worried about the Biden administration's record of having allowed untold immigrants into the country. The party was increasingly seen as soft on crime following the “defund the police” protests and the aftermath of the death of George Floyd at the the hands of law enforcement.

But the Trump administrations tactics changed all that.

Just 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in January, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a ICE officer in Minnesota.

Last week, almost all House Democrats voted against the Homeland Security bill, as the package was sent the Senate.

Then there was the shooting death of Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis.

Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, who was among the seven Democrats who had voted to approve the Homeland Security funds, reversed course Monday in a Facebook post.

“I hear the anger from my constituents, and I take responsibility for that,” Suozzi wrote.

He said he “failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis.”

Voting ahead as shutdown risk grows

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday the responsibility for averting another shutdown falls to Republicans, who have majority control, to break apart the six-bill package, removing the homeland funds while allowing the others to go forward.

“We can pass them right away,” Schumer said.

But the White House panned that approach and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has blamed Democrats for last year's shutdown, the longest in history, has been mum. The GOP speaker would need to recall lawmakers to Washington to vote.

Republicans believe they will be able to portray Democrats as radical if the government shuts down over Homeland Security funds, and certain centrist Democrats have warned the party against strong anti-ICE language.

A memo from centrist Democratic group Third Way had earlier warned lawmakers against proposals to ""abolish” ICE as “emotionally satisfying, politically lethal.” In a new memo Monday it proposed “Overhauling ICE” with top-to-bottom changes, including removing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from her job.

GOP faces a divide on deportations

But Republicans also risk being sideways with public opinion over Trump's immigration and deportation agenda.

Republicans prefer to keep the focus on Trump's ability to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, with illegal crossings at all-time lows, instead of the military-style deportation agenda. They are particularly sensitive to concerns from gun owners' groups that Pretti, who was apparently licensed to carry a firearm, is being criticized for having a gun with him before he was killed.

GOP Sen. Rand Paul, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Oversight Committee, demanded that acting ICE director Todd Lyons appear for a hearing — joining a similar demand from House Republicans over the weekend.

At the same time, many GOP lawmakers continue to embrace the Trump administration's deportation strategy.

“I want to be very clear,” said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., in a post. “I will not support any efforts to strip DHS of its funding.”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6bab0e/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fdf%2F7f90ed7ff9d2bc29894b82a3e6f3da%2F108f8bd226364d31b5f981965d0f1c44Winter_Weather_Washington_29779.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:03:11.768072

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) highlighted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests of national security threats since January 20, 2025.

“Just a year ago, under Joe Biden, our border was wide-open and criminals, gang members, and terrorists were released into our communities,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst, including national security threats. In one year of the Trump administration, ICE has arrested national security threats—making America safe again. We are delivering on the American people’s mandate to make America safe again, and we’re just getting started.”

Some of the worst of the worst national security threats arrested include:

The shooting and killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis this weekend may have a big effect on Congress. Funding for several federal agencies expires midnight Friday. Senate Democrats have now mobilized to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security in response to Pretti's death. And if lawmakers are unable to break the impasse, that could lead to a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. Joining us now to discuss all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hey, Claudia.

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: So the Senate was on track to pass this final round of funding bills, with bipartisan support. How has the death of Alex Pretti changed that?

GRISALES: Right. And to recap, the House passed this $1.3 trillion spending package to fund big areas of the federal government past Friday night, and it would include funding for the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services and others, and it did draw bipartisan votes. But Senate Democrats, on their end, had signaled this would be easily passed in their chamber this week. However, with the death of Pretti, we saw a 180. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats will block this entire funding package unless the DHS funding is split off from it. And Schumer said that the legislation, as written, is, quote, ""woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,"" end quote.

DETROW: Now, let's turn our head back to the last shutdown. There was that split among Democrats about holding out for health care subsidies. Are you seeing similar tension, similar splits in the caucus when it comes to what to do with Homeland Security funding?

GRISALES: No, this is very different, even as Republicans push back on Democrats' plans to block this entire funding package if DHS is not pulled out of it. One aide told me that when we saw the killing of Renee Good earlier this month, that some said this was a one-off. But they argue that with the death of Alex Pretti, this is now part of a disturbing and alarming trend. And for Democrats, the intensity of the resolve is higher this time. And the Democrats we saw defect last time to end the government shutdown, such as Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, have already said they're nos this time. And so far, we've just seen one Democrat say he'll vote for the package. That's John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. He says he doesn't vote for shutdowns. So he may be on an island for his party this time around.

DETROW: What are Republicans saying?

GRISALES: Well, most Republicans are standing by the administration's policy in general, but we're seeing more and more call for answers. That includes Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick, who said he agreed with a statement issued by the NRA that there needs to be a full investigation. The NRA had taken issue with comments from Trump officials saying that Pretti was armed, so his killing may have been justified. We also know that the chair of House Homeland Security, New York's Andrew Garbarino, is also calling for an oversight hearing with DHS officials. We know DHS Secretary Kristi Noem will go before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but that is not soon enough for many.

As for leadership, we're hearing Senate Majority Leader John Thune applaud Trump's decision to send Tom Homan to Minneapolis. He is hoping that will cool down temperatures there. And a spokesman for Thune said Monday, Republicans do not plan to separate the DHS funding bill out. So at this rate, we could be headed for a partial shutdown come this weekend.

DETROW: That is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Claudia, thanks so much.

GRISALES: Thank you.

Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, is also weighing a request by Minnesota state officials for an order pausing the deployment of thousands of immigration enforcement officers in the state.

Menendez told lawyers at a hearing Monday that she was wrestling with the broad scope of the state’s request to pause Operation Metro Surge and order officers off the street while the legal fight continues. US officials have “a lot of power” to carry out immigration laws, she noted.

But the judge also questioned the Justice Department’s assertion that the goal of the surge isn’t to force Minnesota to change its policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, highlighting a disconnect between US officials’ public statements and the government’s arguments in court.

The poll, conducted between Friday and Sunday, comes amid an outcry over a US border agent’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, over the weekend.

Pretti was the second person to be killed by a federal agent in the city in less than a month, following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, on January 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.

Facing growing backlash, Trump said on Monday that he would send his border tsar, Tom Homan, to Minneapolis and struck a positive tone on his administration’s relations with Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, following what he described as “a very good” telephone conversation between the two men.

In the new poll, 58 percent of respondents said US Immigration and Customs agents had gone “too far” in their crackdown on unauthorised migration, compared with 26 percent who said their actions were “about right” and 12 percent who said they did not go far enough.

The polling mirrors the findings of several opinion surveys carried out before Pretti’s killing.

In a poll conducted by The New York Times/Siena University and released on Friday, 61 percent of respondents said ICE’s tactics had gone too far, compared with 26 percent who said they were “about right” and 11 percent who believed they did not go far enough.

In a written statement Monday, a spokesperson characterized those arrested as ""illegal aliens.""

But in many cases, immigration lawyers, employers and family members of those detained say many are pursuing lawful immigration pathways such as asylum, and have legal documents to work in the U.S.

The DHS statement highlighted four people it says have criminal records — the same four people it highlighted in a press release last Wednesday announcing the operation.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills continued to criticize the ongoing surge of immigration enforcement in the state.

The governor said ICE's tactics are unnecessarily confrontational with observers and that it's detaining people who are lawfully present in the U.S.

Speaking on Maine Calling Monday, Mills said ICE is pursuing detention quotas instead of targeting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.

She said businesses are calling her office because their workers are getting detained and that they are asylum seekers and others authorized to work and live in Maine.

""I'm getting calls from employers. They're saying, 'my people are getting ... kidnapped and taken out of their homes and their cars and they're just gone,"" she said.

Mills, a Democrat, has also been critical of Republican Sen. Susan Collins, whom she hopes to challenge in this year's midterm election.

Mills said Collins isn't using her position on the Senate budget committee to hold ICE accountable.

Collins was not available for an interview. In response to questions about ICE's conduct in Maine and Minnesota, her spokesperson said the senator has asked the Department of Homeland Security to explain how it's targeting detainees and why ICE is allowing agents to enter homes without judicial warrants.

""Senator Collins has contacted the Department of Homeland Security about the ICE activities occurring in Maine, including with respect to the specific detentions as reported in the Maine press,"" the spokesperson said. ""She has asked for answers about the legal bases for these actions and about how ICE is prioritizing its activities to target what it calls 'the worst of the worst.'""

She requested additional court filings from Trump administration lawyers by Wednesday.","MINNEAPOLIS — After ""very good"" phone calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, President Trump announced that border czar Tom Homan will be heading to the midwestern state to lead federal immigration enforcement efforts there.

The surge of agents to Minneapolis has resulted in waves of protest, legal action, and political backlash against the Trump administration, especially after the shooting deaths of two American citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, at the hands of federal immigration agents.

In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters on Monday, Gov. Walz described a ""more collaborative tone"" from Trump, and said the president agreed to consider reducing the number of federal immigration agents in the Twin Cities. He further confirmed that Gregory Bovino, the bombastic and controversial Border Patrol chief leading the surge, will soon leave the state.

Bovino's exit may help to turn down the temperature of protests in Minneapolis, which have been peaceful but fraught in the days since Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot by CBP officers. Bovino repeatedly defended the actions of his officers, saying without evidence that Pretti intended to ""massacre"" federal agents, and that he ""assaulted"" them.

The video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far contradict that assertion. The Trump administration has not provided evidence to support Bovino's claims.

State officials say they were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's killing on Saturday, and have sued over access to DHS-controlled evidence, which includes body camera footage from the officers involved.

The state is also trying to end the surge through legal avenues. On Monday, state officials sought an immediate restraining order to end what the Trump administration has dubbed ""Operation Metro Surge"" and return the number of federal immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis to pre-surge levels.

""They tell us, and this is their words, this is the single largest deployment of immigration officers in one place at one time,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told reporters outside federal court in Minneapolis on Monday. ""What justifies this disproportionate flood? Nothing legitimate.""

The state's legal team pointed to a social media post from President Trump in which he promised a day of ""RECKONING & RETRIBUTION"" for Minnesota, and to a letter sent to the state over the weekend by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, which they characterized as a ""ransom note"" offering to end the DHS surge in exchange for voter registration records and the end of the state's sanctuary policies.

Representatives for the Trump administration told the judge that the letter simply acknowledges the fact that, without sanctuary policies, the federal government would not have to send as many officers into the state.

The U.S. District Court judge overseeing the case, Katherine Menendez, declined to grant a restraining order in the state's case.

Bovino is expected to depart Minneapolis tomorrow, and President Donald Trump said he is sending border czar Tom Homan to lead the operation there.","Approximately 26 people were arrested Monday night during a protest outside a suburban Twin Cities hotel, police told CNN.

Video from the Associated Press showed dozens of protesters gathered at the SpringHill Suites in Maple Grove, where they believed top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino was staying. The protesters used pots, pans and kitchen utensils to make noise outside the building.

“The situation escalated when individuals in the crowd engaged in unlawful behavior,” the Maple Grove Police Department said in a statement on Facebook. “Property damage occurred and objects were thrown at officers.”

Police issued a dispersal order and “those who failed to comply with lawful orders or committed crimes were arrested,” the statement said.

By 10 p.m., the crowd had dispersed, the police statement read.

Police told CNN they were still processing the arrests and the final number may change.

CNN has reached out to CBP an DHS for more information. The hotel declined to comment.

Micayla Pretti, Alex Pretti’s younger sister, remembered her brother in a statement Monday as a “kind, generous” person who “had a way of lighting up every room he walked into,” and calling him her hero.

“All Alex ever wanted was to help someone––anyone. Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that,” she went on to say, apparently referencing videos showing the ICU nurse putting himself between immigration officers and a woman they’d just shoved before they spray him with a chemical irritant and, moments later, shoot him.

“When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?” Micayla Pretti said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he felt “a definite change of tone” during his phone conversation with President Donald Trump Monday, telling MPR News, “I’m going to take them for their word right now.”

During the conversation, Walz said he asked Trump to allow the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to conduct an independent investigation into the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti – both US citizens shot by federal officers during the sweeping immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities. “He said he would look into it,” Walz said of Trump’s response.

The president also agreed to consider reducing the number of immigration enforcement agents in the state, Walz told MPR.

The governor said he plans to speak with Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, and strike a collaborative plan. Homan is expected take over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino leaves the state.

“We’ve laid out the case that we do the right thing. We don’t want criminals here, but we also recognize that someone coming here to find a better life should be treated with dignity, that Americans shouldn’t be fearing for their lives to go out of their house just because of the color of their skin,” Walz said.

“I think Donald Trump understands it, too,” he added.

FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday his agency is looking into Signal group chats allegedly used by Minneapolis residents to share sightings of federal agents, warning that people cannot “create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm’s way.”

Patel told conservative influencer Benny Johnson in a podcast interview the FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken in Signal group chats.

Patel did not elaborate on specific instances where Signal groups allegedly led to a crime being committed. CNN has reached out to the FBI for more information.

Signal is a messaging app known for its robust security features, such as end-to-end encryption, meaning data is scrambled in transit and can only be seen by the sender and recipient.

As the Trump administration deploys thousands of federal officers to carry out turbocharged immigration operations across the country – with the Minneapolis area now the epicenter – growing networks of volunteers who call themselves ICE observers appear to be intensifying their efforts, CNN previously reported.

Volunteers document arrests, some tail ICE agents in vehicles, while others blow whistles warning community members of ICE enforcement.

The Justice Department has formally withdrawn its request for the chief judge in Minnesota’s federal court to issue arrest warrants for journalist Don Lemon and four others for their alleged involvement in an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a church service in Minnesota.

Their request was made after a lower court judge refused to approve criminal complaints against several people the department claims were part of the protest. A person familiar with the matter said that Lemon is one the individuals whose arrest warrants were declined.

Despite their withdrawal, the DOJ can still attempt to bring charges against Lemon, including through a grand jury indictment. Officials have not publicly said what their plans are moving forward.

Lemon has said that he was present at the demonstration as a journalist and not as a protester. In a video of the episode that he posted on YouTube, Lemon says “I’m just here photographing, I’m not part of the group … I’m a journalist.”

Three other people have been charged in connection to the protest.

The Department of Homeland Security on Monday said approximately 3,000 officers and agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are currently conducting immigration operations in the Minneapolis area.

The agency’s response, noted in a court filing, comes after a federal judge earlier Monday requested details of the current scale of “Operation Metro Surge.”

During the earlier hearing, the Justice Department said a total of 4,000 federal agents had been surged statewide, with roughly 2,000 coming from ICE and 2,000 from CBP.

Some agents are expected to leave Minneapolis Tuesday, along with top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, sources say.

Patient of Alex Pretti describes moment she found out he was shot and killed

06:05

Alex Pretti was inspired to start protesting against ICE in Minneapolis after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, according to Marta Crownhart, a Navy veteran who was treated by Pretti earlier this month.

Crownhart said she’d discussed Good’s killing with Pretti while she was his patient at the Minneapolis VA hospital.

“He just knew that she was a good person, from what he had heard, and that she was killed for no good reason,” she said in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.

Pretti “felt so strongly about how Renee Good had died,” Crownhart said, and had described “the difference that he wanted to make in the world and in Minneapolis.”

Crownhart remembered him as a “very caring, kind-hearted” person who treated each patient like they were his only responsibility.

“He was never preoccupied,” she said. “He never was thinking about anybody else. He was always there for you.”

Returning to the Minneapolis VA, where she volunteers, it was “very difficult to look at the doors and know that he’s not there.”

But what hurt the most, according to Crownhart, was hearing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem call Pretti a “domestic terrorist” shortly after he was killed.

“I can’t imagine his parents listening to that or hearing what she had said about him,” she said, tearing up. “I think that hurt worse than anything.”

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he’s happy with the news that top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will be leaving Minneapolis, but he still maintains “zero trust” that the Department of Homeland Security will “do the right thing” in the investigation into Alex Pretti’s death.

“There’s no way I can trust anything that they say or do, including preserve evidence,” Ellison told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “Why would they preserve evidence of a crime … in a case where they’re denying that there was any crime committed by these officers at all? I just don’t believe it.”

Ellison’s comments follow a federal judge’s Saturday ruling in Minnesota granting a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agencies from destroying or altering evidence related to the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Pretti.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office requested the order after suing the Trump administration earlier Saturday.

“I don’t trust them at all, and I hope the court rules in our favor to protect this evidence,” Ellison said.

A Monday afternoon hearing ended without a decision from the judge on whether to keep the TRO in place, though he said he would rule “forthwith.”

CORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated the day the judge granted the temporary restraining order. It was Saturday.

Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, one of the Democrats who said she will block a government spending bill following the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent, cast doubt on the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to fairly investigate the death of the 37-year-old ICU nurse and pushed for more cooperation between state and local officials.

Pointing to how Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was prevented from accessing the scene of Pretti’s shooting to collect evidence in its own investigation, Smith said it was unusual because state and federal investigators typically collaborate “to gather the evidence and understand what’s happening” in probing officer-involved shootings.

“And it’s one of the reasons why people in Minnesota and I think around the country are just saying, this looks like a cover up. How could you have any credibility when you have the department investigating itself?” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

Smith’s comments come hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said today that President Donald Trump had agreed to allow the state’s investigation to continue. The BCA was granted an order from a federal judge over the weekend prohibiting DHS from destroying or altering any evidence gathered around the shooting.

Dr. Aasma Shaukat, a co-worker and mentor of Alex Pretti at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, said the 37-year-old ICU nurse was full of empathy and compassion and easily connected with the veteran patients he cared for at work.

“He really connected with patients, particularly veterans, that he thought were a vulnerable group, and he truly believed he was helping them. Not everybody can do that as easily as Alex,” Shaukat told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

Shaukat, who worked alongside Pretti for six years, said she wasn’t surprised to learn that he was engaged in peaceful protests in the community.

“He was all about being a good citizen, standing up for your neighbors, your community, and standing up for what he believed was unjust or unfair,” she said. “That would be very much Alex.”

After news broke that top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will be leaving Minneapolis, the city’s police chief told CNN some of Bovino’s actions have “not been helpful.”

“He was riding around in the city with a caravan and stopping at places and kind of just shaking things up — that’s not been helpful,” Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara said.

The chief said he hopes Bovino’s departure signals deescalation of the tense situation in Minneapolis.

“Nobody in law enforcement is saying federal law enforcement should not be enforcing federal law. That’s ridiculous, right?” he said. “But I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think that federal law enforcement should operate by the same standards and professionalism that the rest of law enforcement in the state does.”

Chris Madel was rising quickly in the polls as a GOP candidate in Minnesota’s governor’s race. But now he’s no longer running because he said he cannot be part of the Republican “retribution” going on in his state.

“The president posted something on Truth Social saying that it was a time of reckoning and retribution on the citizens of my state, and I’ve seen that happen, and I cannot be a part of it — and I can’t be a part of a party that’s a part of that,” he told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

He initially supported the immigration crackdown and “the idea of getting rid of the worst of the worst,” he said, but several law enforcement officers told him they got pulled over by federal agents because of the color of their skin.

With tensions rising, Madel said, it has “just gotten to a point where it’s just so incredibly out of hand.” In the end, he said, he wants to lead by example for his daughters, and show them you have to stand up for things that aren’t right.

“We need to treat everybody with a measure of humanity, and that’s what it really means to be an American. That’s what we are. We are a nation of immigrants,” he said.

The idea of people walking around with their papers or photos of their passports because they are scared of being swept up by federal agents is “antithetical to everything our country is about,” Madel said.

The Department of Homeland Security has underscored that Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who became the face of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, has not been removed from his duties.

“Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X today.

Bovino “is a key part of the President’s team and a great American,” she added.

Some background: Bovino and some of his agents are expected to leave Minneapolis tomorrow and return to their respective sectors, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. Trump is dispatching White House border czar Tom Homan to manage Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Minneapolis in the wake of Saturday’s fatal Border Patrol shooting of a US citizen. This change will not result in Bovino’s removal from his duties, the administration has clarified.

The Department of Homeland Security has suspended border patrol official Gregory Bovino’s access to his social media accounts effective immediately, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Bovino would use one X account, @CMDROpAtLargeCA, to post multiple times a day, trolling his critics, sharing mugshots of immigrants his officers arrested, and publicizing his own appearances at press conferences and on cable news.

Over the weekend, Bovino had scrapped with lawmakers and others online, responding to their posts on X about the shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. In several recent posts to social media, Bovino had accused Pretti of assaulting federal law enforcement officers before he was killed — a claim that is not supported by video of the moments leading up to his death.

Bovino is expected to depart Minneapolis tomorrow, and President Donald Trump said he is sending border czar Tom Homan to lead the operation there.

The US Department of Education (DOE) and Health and Human Services (HHS) referred two Minnesota agencies to the Department of Justice for their “refusal to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) by allowing men to compete in women’s sports and occupy women’s intimate facilities.”

What the statement from DOE and HHS says: The state agencies — Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) — were notified in September of their Title IX violations and asked to voluntarily resolve them or risk action. But Minnesota has indicated it won’t accept the proposed resolution or negotiate.

“As Minnesota reels from a massive fraud scandal exposing Governor Tim Walz’s dereliction of duty, today’s referral to DOJ underscores the state’s ongoing failure to safeguard its citizens and uphold the rule of law. The Trump Administration will not stop until accountability is delivered for Minnesota’s students,” said Linda McMahon, US Secretary of Education, in the statement.

“Minnesota is violating Title IX, and we will not look the other way,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., US Secretary of Health and Human Services.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2026-01-25t173302z-520175463-rc2g8jayjvv3-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-minnesota.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-27 02:58:04.773502

'Out of control': Gov. Healey criticizes feds after latest deadly shooting by ICE agents in Minnesota

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey sharply criticized federal immigration enforcement practices and members of the Trump administration on Monday, following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minnesota.Healey, who was asked about the incident after she gave remarks about the winter storm affecting the Bay State, called the latest shooting ""unnecessary."" She said the incident is emblematic of what she described as an out-of-control agency operating without adequate training or accountability.Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, was fatally shot on Saturday. The Trump administration has sought to portray the 37-year-old as an armed threat who intended to harm federal agents during a Minneapolis protest, but video of the incident seems to contradict these statements. Pretti is seen holding a phone in the video and was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but was reportedly not brandishing one when he was shot by federal agents on Saturday. Border Patrol officials say Pretti resisted disarmament, leading to his shooting. On Monday, Healey rejected the administration's statements as ""lies"" and attempts to smear Pretti after his death. ""This just isn't right,"" Healey said on Monday. ""There was no need for all of that to go down in the way that it did.""The governor, a former prosecutor and attorney general, said the conduct of federal officers in Minnesota ran counter to basic law enforcement standards and posed a threat to public safety rather than enhancing it.She also raised concerns about ICE recruitment and training practices.""You would never run a law enforcement agency with online training,"" Healey said. Ultimately, Healey called for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and urged President Donald Trump to rein in immigration enforcement agencies. If the administration fails to act, she said, Congress must intervene to restore accountability.""Kristi Noem has got to go. ICE has got to get out of these communities now. And Donald Trump needs to act and step up. And if he doesn't act, then Republicans in Congress need to force that accountability here, because we cannot continue to have Americans in our neighborhoods and cities and states across this country at risk. That's what needs to happen right now,"" Healey said.

The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data.
Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.","PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal judge in Oregon dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit seeking Oregon's unredacted voter rolls on Monday in another setback to wide-ranging efforts by President Donald Trump's administration to get detailed voter data from states.

In a hearing, U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he would dismiss the suit and issue a final written opinion in the coming days. The updated docket for the case showed that Oregon's move to dismiss the case was granted.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield welcomed the move.

“The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,” he said in an emailed statement. ""Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can’t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Kasubhai scheduled the hearing after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dated Saturday, the same day federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, which has seen widespread protests over increased immigration enforcement and the previous killing of Renee Good by an immigration officer.

In her letter, Bondi asked the Democratic governor to support immigration officers and shared three “simple steps” to “help bring back law and order"" — including by giving the Justice Department the ability to “access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

Bondi also asked for the state's records of its Medicaid and food assistance programs, and for the repeal of sanctuary policies that limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Officials in many states have said turning over such information would violate both state and federal privacy laws.

The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data. Last week a federal judge in Georgia dismissed such a suit after ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city, and earlier this month a federal judge in California dismissed a suit there after finding the government’s request was “unprecedented and illegal.”

The department has said it needs to access detailed voter data to ensure election officials are following federal election laws. Election officials have disputed that and raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.

In a July letter, the department asked Oregon for an electronic copy of its statewide registration list and details on the steps it has taken to remove ineligible voters, court filings show. It sent another letter in August saying it needed the voter list to assess compliance with federal law, and that the list must include information such as full names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers.

Oregon officials responded in August that the department lacked the authority to request the list and offered to provide the publicly available list, court filings show. The department argued it has the authority to request the data under multiple federal laws and is complying with privacy laws.

Kasubhai called for the Monday hearing in Oregon's lawsuit so that attorneys on both sides could provide additional arguments on how Bondi's letter was relevant in interpreting the “basis and purpose” of the department's request for voter data.

The department argued it had authority under the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to request voter records, as the law says such records are to be made available to the U.S. Attorney General upon a demand in writing that states the basis and purpose of the request. Yet Kasubhai said the department's August letter did not satisfy the law's requirement for stating a basis and purpose when requesting voter records. He added that he read the congressional record of the time when the law was passed, and found it was “unequivocal” on the release of records being associated with investigations involving discrimination in elections.

The Justice Department’s outreach has raised alarm among some election officials because the agency doesn’t have the constitutional authority to run elections. That power is granted to states and Congress. Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1c8ec51d-b580-4bf2-9b4d-2e785a055ea9/wirestory_f0a3477a5fa061cc71e9ee6ce652ff7a_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-27 03:59:21.039158

Amy Walter: Yes.
At the beginning of President Trump's term, approval rating of handling immigration was higher than his overall handling of the job that he was doing.
Amy Walter: Right.
Geoff Bennett: Amy Walter and Tamara Keith, our thanks to you, as always.","Geoff Bennett:

It is shaping up to be a consequential week in the nation's capital, as cracks emerge inside the Republican Party over the Trump administration's handling of its immigration crackdown in Minnesota and beyond.

For analysis, we're joined tonight by our Politics Monday team. That's Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.

It's good to see you both.

Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:

Hello.

Geoff Bennett:

So, Amy, for all of the talk about this defiant Trump White House, the White House is not immune to sustained public pressure.

Amy Walter:

Yes.

Geoff Bennett:

What does the latest polling show about how the American public broadly views its immigration approach?

Amy Walter:

Yes, it's really interesting, Geoff. At the beginning of President Trump's term, approval rating of handling immigration was higher than his overall handling of the job that he was doing.

Now, as both of those have come down over the course of his presidency, still, for much of the year, immigration has been higher. But -- and it's not just because of what we have seen in Minnesota. We started to see this dip really going back earlier than this, where opinions about how Trump's handling immigration are now basically matching his overall approval rating.

What happened? I think a lot of it is that the conversation about immigration is no longer about immigration. It's no longer about the border. It's not even about this conversation about what we and how we should be handling the things that we normally talk about, like path to citizenship or DACA.

Instead, what we're talking about are very specifically the way that agents whose job it is to apprehend these folks, the ICE agents, are treating communities and, in the case of Minnesota, these two individuals who were shot by these agents.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Tam, you heard Senator Smith describe this as a coalition of the horrified, Democrats and Republicans who take issue with the way that the Trump administration is executing its immigration priorities here.

I mean, could this be one of the moments where voters who backed Trump on immigration begin to recoil from the methods, even if they still support the end goal?

Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:

I think that we are starting to see that.

NPR had a focus group that we sat in on conducted by Engagious. And there -- they were talking specifically to people who voted for President Biden and then voted for President Trump in 2024. And about a third of them raised their hands and said they thought that ICE was going too far. These were Trump voters who said that ICE was going too far.

And I think that the surest sign that the politics on this are not the best is President Trump himself.

The fact that he is trying to distance himself from what happened in Minnesota, the fact that he and his chief spokesperson are distancing him from the statements of Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, and Stephen Miller, his deputy chief of staff, the fact that they are putting some separation there is an indication of a real shift and an indication that President Trump realizes this may not be a political winner.

And I have previously said here that the Trump administration has one speed, and it is to fight. Well, they just suddenly discovered a different gear. They're in reverse. They are looking for an exit strategy from the really heightened rhetoric that -- and just really heightened situation on the ground in Minnesota.

Amy Walter:

Yes.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Amy, one of the Republican candidates for governor dropped out of the race this morning, Chris Madel.

He wrote an op-ed saying that ICE has gone too far. He accused national Republicans of pursuing retribution against the state's leaders. If even GOP candidates are worried about how the administration's enforcement strategy is landing, what does that say to you?

Amy Walter:

Yes.

I mean, the fact that you also had a lot of Republicans across the country take to social media over the weekend to say, again, the opposite of what the secretary of homeland security was saying, the opposite of what some of the folks of the administration were saying, they came out really and said, don't like what we're seeing here, this is a tragedy and that they're saying we need to have some more oversight here.

That, for Republicans, is a big push, to say we're going to have oversight over an executive branch, executive authority, executive branch. But how far this goes -- right, we always wonder how far will this go?

And that's why Lisa on here a few minutes ago made a really good -- helped us really understand what comes next, but trying to figure out what that line is between what Republicans are willing to do in terms of a funding bill, what kinds of oversight they're willing to provide and whether or not Democrats will believe that that is good enough.

When I was talking to a Democratic strategist earlier today, the frustration among Democrats is as telling as some of these rifts among Republicans. So making a deal isn't just about getting Republicans on board. It's getting Democrats to trust and to want to agree with a compromise on the Republican side.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Tam, what's the risk for Democrats here if there is one for confronting these tactics head on, given past political losses on crime and immigration?

Amy Walter:

Right.

Tamara Keith:

Yes.

So the issue that Democrats have had is that Republicans have been able to own immigration. They have won many a midterm with a Democratic president by campaigning on immigration, talking about the border. But as Amy mentioned before, this is different. This is Americans in American cities being killed by immigration agents.

So if Democrats are able to keep it focused on that and not talk about open borders or eliminate ICE, which had been something that they had campaigned on before and then that was thrown in their faces, there is a careful balance here. But the fact that these videos exist, the fact that people, like, everyone is seeing these videos really makes this a visceral issue for a lot of voters.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you see it, Amy?

Amy Walter:

Yes, I absolutely agree with that.

And that's why, again, you look at this New York Times poll that came out last week, this -- again, before what happened this weekend -- I'm sorry -- it came out last week. Do you support Trump's deportation of immigrants living here illegally? Fifty percent of Americans say, yes, they do.

But then you ask the question, do you think -- do you approve of how ICE is handling its job? Only 36 percent approve of it. So the issue isn't that people are saying, we should not be deporting people who are here illegally. What they are disagreeing with is the way that ICE is handling it.

And that, again, if we had a Congress that was working together, that is the sweet spot there. Fix the problem with the enforcement. That's where the crux of the matter sits.

Geoff Bennett:

Amy Walter and Tamara Keith, our thanks to you, as always.

A federal judge in Minnesota heard arguments today on whether to expel ICE agents from the state and put an end to the Trump administration's sweeping immigration enforcement.

The hearing comes as state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul officials warn that ICE's actions have pushed them into crisis.

We're joined now by Mary McCord, executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law.

Mary, thank you for being with us.

Mary McCord, Former Justice Department Official:

Sure. My pleasure.

Geoff Bennett:

At its heart, is this lawsuit, is this case really about immigration enforcement or is it fundamentally about the balance of power between states and the federal government?

Mary McCord:

Well, the way that it's been pled by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it does bring to issue this idea of federalism and principles of states' rights and the federal government's rights.

And they have a number of other claims, but two of the key claims in their complaint and the key claims that were in their motion for preliminary injunction that was heard by the court today is that what the government is doing here with this entire surge in the way it's been implemented has violated the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment when it comes to some of the searches and seizures, the First Amendment when it comes to retaliation against protesters, racial profiling, aggressive conduct, all those things.

They're saying that this infringes on their 10th Amendment rights because states are reserved the police power. And because of the surge and because of the pressure it's putting on the state and the cities and where it's occurring, that's impacting their ability to protect public safety, general health and welfare, all obligations of the state.

And they also argue it violates the notion of equal sovereignty between the states, because they argue that Minnesota is being targeted for political reasons, whereas other states that might even have more undocumented immigrants or the crisis of undocumented immigrants might be greater are not being targeted this way.

Geoff Bennett:

And if the judge were to grant Minnesota's request for a halt or some restriction on ICE's operations, what would that look like in a real way?

Mary McCord:

Well, that's a tough question to answer, because the complaint asks for a lot of relief.

At the heart, what Minnesota wants is for ICE to pull out of this surge, not necessarily every ICE agent to leave, but the surge to end. And that's an extraordinary relief, because, of course, the federal government argues that, under principles of supremacy of federal law, a state can't force them to stop enforcing federal law and that a judge would not be able to do that either.

So it really does pit these interests. And that relief would be pretty extraordinary. There are lesser forms of relief, though, that the judge might be considering, because she's taking this under advisement, which are things like enjoining violations of Fourth Amendment by not racially profiling when they engage in stops, enjoining them from going into sensitive locations like hospitals and schools and day cares, things like that.

So there's a whole sort of variety of relief that she could grant if she agrees with the legal arguments that have been made.

Geoff Bennett:

And on the flip side, if the court sides with the Justice Department and the Trump administration, what precedent might that set for states that challenge federal immigration enforcement and surges like the ones we've seen in Minneapolis?

Mary McCord:

Yes, this case has been different than so many of the other cases that have been brought in places like Portland and in Illinois, Chicago, when it comes to how ICE agents are actually performing their duties.

A lot of those cases, like another case actually that's in Minnesota right now, the Tincher case, those have been brought on behalf of protesters or on behalf of people who have been stopped as suspected being here undocumented. And those are making very specific other types of claims.

And this would have no impact on those lawsuits because the claims made by the state here are very different, these 10th Amendment claims. The other claims are much more personal to the individuals who have been subject to unconstitutional treatment.

So I think that you would still see those types of lawsuits in Minnesota, like there is one ongoing, the Tincher case, or in other states, if we see the type of excessive force and overreach and unconstitutional practices that we are seeing by ICE in Minnesota and that we saw in Portland and that we saw in Chicago and in L.A.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Mary, based on the arguments that you have heard and the legal issues at stake, are there any clues about how this judge might frame her decision?

Mary McCord:

Yes, I was not able to listen to it today because I was working on other things, but I understand that she did ask pointed questions along the nature of what we have been talking about, about how to balance the interest of the federal government and the Supremacy Clause and the interests of the states and the powers reserved to them under the 10th Amendment.

And so she's going to think long and hard about, I think, the legal arguments here before she answers her ruling. And I don't really want to speculate about that because that wouldn't be fair to the parties.

Geoff Bennett:

Understood.

The Minneapolis shooting is also having direct consequences on Capitol Hill. Democratic leaders say they're ready to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security and potentially other agencies.

Our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins, joins us now.

Lisa, it's good to see you.

So what are you hearing from members of Congress and is it in any way different from how they have responded in the past?

Lisa Desjardins:

Let's start with Republicans.

Notably, it was different in that very few of them actually responded initially, despite Stephen Miller and others at the White House signaling aggressive messaging.

Instead, we have something almost from another time, neutrality from some and even some concern from other Republicans, like this from Texas Republican Mike McCaul. He wrote: ""I am troubled by the events that have unfolded. I believe a thorough investigation is necessary, both to get to the bottom of these incidents, but also,"" he wrote, ""to maintain Americans' confidence in our justice system.""

Now, there are many Republicans who also criticize Democrats and say they're to blame for this kind of inciteful atmosphere and tension. Of course, Democrats deny that.

But one example is important to me, the House Oversight chairman, James Comer. He did say Democrats are to blame, but he also is not saying, ICE should double down. He's saying instead maybe ICE should pull back. Here's what he said on FOX Sunday.

Rep. James Comer (R-KY):

The situation's only going to get worse. And I really think that there are so many cities in the United States that have issues with criminal illegals, that I think they would be -- they would be better received in other cities. I hope that's something they're talking about doing right now, because Minneapolis isn't the only city.

Lisa Desjardins:

That reads to me as looking for a way out. Most notably, there are Republicans who are calling for hearings now.

One, look at this letter from Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. He's saying he wants a hearing in the next two weeks or so.

As for Democrats, I have spoken to so many. They're as incensed and also focused, as I have seen them, especially on ICE. They do not want any ICE funding to go through without changes. And indeed that funding is up for a vote potentially this week. Here's what Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, wrote on Twitter. He said that Democrats will not provide the votes needed for that.

What's that mean? Well, that funding is attached to a bunch of other agencies too. So we could be in for a shutdown.

Geoff Bennett:

And the shutdown would affect far more than DHS.

Lisa Desjardins:

Yes, let's take a look here.

These are the agencies that are part of this funding package. These are some of the biggest agencies in government, defense, HHS, transportation housing, in all, about 70 percent of the funding that Congress controls. Democrats want to pull out the HHS part of it and deal with that separately.

But my reporting is, Republicans so far are denying that. They say Trump can have executive actions to curb ICE. Well, you won't be surprised to hear that Democrats don't trust that. They want a legislative fix here, and we really are heading toward a potential shutdown.

Geoff Bennett:

And, separately, Lisa, amid all of this, there was a Democratic member of Congress who was assaulted this past weekend, and the assailant shouted racist remarks? Tell us about that.

Lisa Desjardins:

We're talking about Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost. He was at an event in Utah on Friday, and he announced he was punched in the face and that the assailant, he said, said: ""Trump will deport you.""

Someone has been arrested in this case.

Geoff Bennett:

In December, a different federal judge in California ruled that limited data sharing, including addresses and immigration status, could go forward.
Bondi makes new demand for voter data Bondi also made a seemingly unrelated request: for Minnesota's voter data.
The DOJ has claimed it needs the data to enforce federal election law.
""The law does not give the federal government the authority to obtain this private data,"" Simon said.","Minnesota officials are rebuffing a series of demands from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, as the state continues its clash with the Trump administration over the surge of federal immigration enforcement in the North Star state.

In a letter to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Bondi wrote: ""You and your office must restore the rule of law, support ICE officers, and bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota.""

The letter was dated Saturday, the same day Alex Pretti, a nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by immigration officers — the second fatal shooting by federal agents this month.

Bondi urged Walz to embrace what she called ""common sense solutions,"" including repealing what the Trump administration terms ""sanctuary policies"" and cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Minnesota state officials say the Trump administration is making false claims about its cooperation with ICE.

Walz, who's called on the Trump administration to end its operation in Minnesota, dismissed the letter in a news conference Sunday.

The letter also calls on the state to ""share all of Minnesota's records"" relating to Medicaid and food assistance programs, including SNAP, with the federal government.

The Trump administration has cited allegations of fraud, especially relating to immigrants of Somali descent, in its immigration crackdown.

Minnesota is one of more than 20 states that has so far refused to comply with a demand from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to turn over personal information about people who have applied for or received SNAP benefits over the last six years. The states have argued the demand is unlawful and a federal judge in California issued a preliminary ruling indicating they were likely to prevail in that claim.

Minnesota was also one of 22 states that sued to block the Department of Health and Human Services from sharing sensitive Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security to aid in immigration enforcement efforts. In December, a different federal judge in California ruled that limited data sharing, including addresses and immigration status, could go forward.

Bondi makes new demand for voter data

Bondi also made a seemingly unrelated request: for Minnesota's voter data.

It's not the first time the Department of Justice has sought the state's voter information — and it's an ask that's not isolated to Minnesota.

Instead, it's the latest escalation in the Trump administration's nationwide attempt to consolidate data and execute unprecedented oversight into the country's voting systems.

The DOJ is currently suing Minnesota and roughly two dozen other states — all states Trump lost in the 2020 election — trying to compel them to share unredacted versions of their voter lists with the federal government. The DOJ has claimed it needs the data to enforce federal election law.

Those suits have yet to be successful anywhere, though.

A federal judge in California recently dismissed a suit there, writing that the request was ""unprecedented and illegal,"" and another judge in Oregon signaled that he planned to do the same. A third judge in Georgia dismissed the suit in that state based on a jurisdictional issue.

Minnesota's chief voting official, Democrat Steve Simon, alluded to those outcomes in a statement declining Bondi's request.

""The law does not give the federal government the authority to obtain this private data,"" Simon said. ""It is deeply disturbing that the U.S. Attorney General would make this unlawful request a part of an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security.""

Election law expert Rick Hasen, of UCLA School of Law, echoed those concerns in a strongly worded blog post over the weekend.

""This is outrageous and reprehensible,"" Hasen wrote. ""It shows ICE is not in Minneapolis for law enforcement or immigration purposes. They are there to stir up s*** in blue states and try to extort them …""

The federal government has not been clear on exactly how it plans to use or securely store the data, but it's become clear that part of their plans include running voting lists through a revamped system at the Department of Homeland Security meant to search for noncitizens.

NPR was the first news outlet to report on the details of the system, known as SAVE, but tens of millions of records have now been run through it, and no evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud Trump has long talked about has come to light.

It's also unclear how accurate the system is.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant requests by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul to temporarily halt the immigration operation. She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Menendez questioned the government's motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

""I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?"" Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued that the situation on the street is so dire as to require the court to halt the federal government's enforcement actions.

""If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,"" Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

Brantley Mayers, counsel to the Justice Department's assistant attorney general, said the government's goal is to enforce federal law. Mayers said one lawful action should not be used to discredit another lawful action.

""I don't see how the fact that we're also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge,"" Mayers said.

Menendez questioned where the line was between violating the Constitution and the executive's power to enforce the law. She also asked whether she was being asked to decide between state and federal policies.

""That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,"" she said.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

""I can't be the global keeper of all things here. Like, presumably that will be litigated,"" she said to the state's attorney.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday added urgency to the case.

Border czar to Minnesota

In other developments, President Donald Trump said he had a ""very good"" call with Walz about the latest shooting and that they are now on a ""similar wavelength."" It was an abrupt shift from Trump, who frequently derides Walz for his actions on immigration issues in Minnesota.

Trump also said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. The president's statement comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the public face of the crackdown, answered questions at news conferences over the weekend about Pretti's shooting. Trump posted on social media that Homan will report directly to him.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their request in an effort to restore the conditions that existed before the administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit ""legally frivolous"" and said Minnesota ""wants a veto over federal law enforcement."" They asked the judge to reject the request or to at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday that the lawsuit is needed because of ""the unprecedented nature of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we're looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we've seen something like this.""

Other state implications

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,"" the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday's shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing.

The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

""The fact that anyone would ever think that an agent of the federal government might even think about doing such a thing was completely unforeseeable only a few weeks ago,"" Ellison told reporters. ""But now, this is what we have to do.""

The City has taken support positions on critical legislation to require all immigration enforcement officers to display visible identification and ban non-medical facial coverings during immigration enforcement actions.","The City of West Hollywood condemns in the strongest possible terms the recent use of deadly force by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has resulted in the tragic deaths of Renee Nicole Macklin Good and Alex Jeffrey Pretti.

Our community joins with communities across the nation in expressing profound grief and outrage over the loss of these two U.S. citizens whose lives were cut short during federal immigration operations. These deaths are not isolated or accidental tragedies, they are part of a disturbing pattern of hostile federal actions that tear families apart, destabilize communities, erode public trust, and place immigrant communities, and those who stand alongside them, at grave risk. Such actions foster fear, escalate violence, and endanger civilians, including people who are peacefully assembling and documenting events.

What has unfolded in Minneapolis over the past several days is deeply alarming and stands in direct contradiction to our nation’s most fundamental values of justice, equality, due process, and respect for decency and human rights. The City of West Hollywood reaffirms, clearly and without hesitation, that immigrants are not threats. They are essential members of our communities and vital contributors to the social, cultural, and economic fabric of our nation.

Many people in our community have asked what the City of West Hollywood is doing in response. As a local government, the City is working to take consistent and meaningful action in several specific areas, including:

Direct Services –

Through its Human Services and Rent Stabilization Department, the City of West Hollywood provides direct services to members of immigrant communities, including connections to legal assistance, rental support, food resources, crisis intervention, and referrals. The City is promoting the availability of these services through its multilingual You Are Not Alone campaign in English, Spanish, and Russian, displayed throughout the West Hollywood community. Community members are encouraged to contact the City’s Human Services Division at (323) 848-6510 for support.

Education and Awareness –

The City of West Hollywood strongly encourages immigrant community members to stay informed. The City is distributing Know Your Rights information in English, Spanish, and Russian, and is directing residents and community members to the City’s regularly updated webpage at www.weho.org/knowyourrights. The City also shares up-to-date resources from the Los Angeles County Office of Immigrant Affairs at https://oia.lacounty.gov. Clear and accurate Know Your Rights information helps individuals and families understand legal protections and options, and empowers them to protect themselves, particularly during encounters with immigration enforcement. The City has also co-hosted workshops for workers and businesses to strengthen awareness of legal rights related to immigration actions.

Legal Action –

Since the beginning of 2025, the City of West Hollywood has actively exercised its legal voice by submitting amicus briefs and joining litigation to defend constitutional rights, protect vulnerable community members, and uphold principles of equity, public safety, and local autonomy. The City has supported legal challenges to attacks on birthright citizenship and the termination of humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrant communities from Central America, the Caribbean, and beyond. The City has also advocated to protect access to essential health and safety-net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP benefits, as well as to prevent discriminatory immigration enforcement practices rooted in racial profiling. The City has taken strong positions defending state and local authority against federal overreach, including opposition to efforts that would compel local participation in immigration enforcement, threats to immigrant access to courthouses, and rollbacks of law enforcement accountability and transparency. Notably, the City has intervened as a party in Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, challenging the constitutionality of immigration raids conducted through profiling, and has supported efforts to halt large-scale federal deployments that undermine public safety and community trust. The City is continuously exploring all legal options to protect community members. An updated list of cases where the City has provided Amicus Support to the Court and/or joined in a case is provided at www.weho.org/knowyourrights.

Community Safety –

The City of West Hollywood works closely with its law enforcement partner, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, to maintain peace, uphold public safety, and protect the rights of all residents. Sheriff’s deputies do not enforce civil immigration laws and do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status when responding to calls for service. The Sheriff’s Department is not involved in federal immigration enforcement operations.

Advocacy and Lobbying –

At its last meeting, the West Hollywood City Council approved a Resolution reaffirming the City of West Hollywood’s commitment to upholding the Constitution of the United States and urging Congress to challenge unconstitutional actions taken by the Trump Administration. Through its Resist initiative, the City has established a proactive framework to oppose actions that threaten the rights and well-being of vulnerable community members, including immigrants. This initiative reaffirms the City’s core values of respect, inclusion, and social justice. It includes monitoring and responding to harmful federal policy proposals, empowering City leaders to advocate through public statements, letters, and legal action, and exploring additional programs and services to support residents if critical protections are weakened or eliminated. The City has taken support positions on critical legislation to require all immigration enforcement officers to display visible identification and ban non-medical facial coverings during immigration enforcement actions. The City has also sent letters to its federal representatives outlining the City’s responses to ICE actions and calling on leaders to advocate for the removal of ICE, military, and federal enforcement personnel from our streets. An overview of the City’s Resist initiative is provided on the City’s website at www.weho.org/resist.

Together, these efforts reflect the City of West Hollywood’s unwavering commitment to upholding human rights, advancing equity, and fostering an inclusive community. We will continue to take action, speak out, and demand accountability.",,N,,2026-01-27 02:58:09.827452

On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul called on the country’s top three immigration enforcement officials to testify before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which he chairs. He said Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of tax dollars and to protect the American people.

“As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,” Paul said in letters addressed to officials with Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Bystander videos and witness testimony show Pretti was holding a phone and helping a woman pushed by federal agents before he was sprayed with a chemical agent, pinned to the ground and fatally shot.

Trump administration officials immediately defended the agents’ actions as self-defense, calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and saying he intended to “massacre” officers. The Department of Homeland Security said Pretti was armed. However, Pretti had a permit to legally carry the gun in his holster and was at no point brandishing it in any of the bystander videos analyzed by major media organizations. One agent appeared to remove the gun moments before he was shot multiple times.

Paul’s letters don’t mention Pretti’s killing, but the hearing scheduled for Feb. 12 would be the first opportunity for senators to question Trump officials directly over the shooting.

U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie and state Rep. Savannah Maddox of Dry Ridge took issue with the Trump administration’s claims that Pretti was a threat to law enforcement because he was carrying a firearm.

“Your federal government is trying to convince you that the mere state of being armed—which is your God-given, constitutionally protected right—is a “threat to law enforcement,” Maddox said on the website X. “Subverting the 2nd Amendment was not ok under Biden, and it’s not ok now.”

Massie said carrying a firearm “is not a death sentence,” but a constitutionally protected right.

U.S. Rep. James Comer suggested in a Fox News segment on Sunday that Trump should consider sending ICE to a different U.S. city.

“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, okay, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals? Are we going to allow our governor, attorney general and mayor to get away with this?'” Comer said.

Meanwhile Rep. Andy Barr said in a Facebook post he proudly supports funding ICE and the administration’s deportation efforts.

“Democrats opened the border to millions, including hundreds on the FBI Terror Watch List. Biden failed. President Trump shut it down, 2+ million deported. We won’t back down!""

This isn’t a bunch of randoms,” and: “Follow the money and it’ll eventually lead back to the CCP.” Clearly, the Right is unable to comprehend (or unwilling to admit to) the organic strength of grassroots movement-building—the reality that neighbors are committed to showing up for each other with dedication and fortitude, out of solidarity and love.

Short for Make America Great Again, the slogan of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Learn more influencers, of course, often find it useful to amplify the imagined threat of conspiratorial, all-powerful enemies lurking around every corner. From the ‘Q drops’ of QAnon to the pages of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Rightists chase like catnip anything that promises a forbidden glimpse into the hidden heart of Leftist power.

But the Minneapolis ICE Watch signal group was no fairytale—which is precisely what scared them. Beneath their fevered calls for federal prosecution was the grudging acknowledgment that their side could never pull this kind of thing off. They’re forced to admit that they don’t really have people power—the kind that makes neighbors stand side by side in the cold, again and again, over the long haul. And they never will, because the right-wing project is genuinely unpopular, which makes it precarious and fragile.

To be sure, the Right can organize too. From January 6 and Unite the Right to the legacy of the Klan, history is replete with examples of the successful mobilization of reactionary backlash. But they can’t dream of the level of grassroots mobilization on display from just a single unvetted ICE Watch Signal-chat in one city. The solidarity on display terrifies them—as it should. So they cling as tightly as they can to the levers of state and institutional power (along with their massive funding streams) yet they’re haunted by the realization that in the long run, this may not be enough.

It’s also hard to miss the note of envy. Indeed, there’s always been a not-so-subtle thread of envy running through the history of conservatism. Whether it’s the French Revolution, 1917, the 1960s New Left or Minneapolis today, the Right has been persistently jealous that the forces of human emancipation are not only more numerous and better organized than they are, but that they’re also having more fun and have a more compelling vision of the future than they can ever dream of.",https://religiondispatches.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_share_image/public/images/ICE.jpeg?itok=NqmfiR8e,N,,2026-01-27 00:58:17.070288

As Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and some immigration agents depart, ""border tsar"" Tom Homan will begin leading on-the-ground efforts in the Minnesota city after the shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday escalated tensions.

The decision by President Donald Trump may indicate the administration's interest in walking back more aggressive federal action in his nationwide immigration crackdown.

Despite the announcement, online tracking of immigration raids shows the administration's efforts have still continued.

Bovino was the face of the operation when Pretti - an observer seen filming agents - got into a confrontation that led to him being shot numerous times on a street in Minneapolis.

The border control commander inflamed the situation on the ground in the aftermath of the shooting, claiming that Pretti intended to ""massacre"" federal agents.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading ""sickening lies"" about what happened.

Before the shooting, Bovino was key to the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration enforcement in several cities, active on social media and regularly filming raids and posting promotional videos showing his agents' action.

Homan, who will report directly to the president, advocates for Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement. But he also has experience in the role - Homan worked with immigration and deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration.

In Minneapolis on Monday, tension and frustration over the presence of federal officials remained high, despite the news that Bovino and some agents would be leaving.

""A lot of people aren't able to work right now, they aren't able to leave their house, they're afraid,"" said George Cordero, a resident of St Paul, Minneapolis', sister city.

Pretti was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state; Renee Nicole Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January.

Some media reports on Monday suggested Bovino had been let go from his role, but Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin refuted that, saying the border patrol chief ""is a key part of the President's team and a great American"".

Much of the anger in the city and from politicians on both sides of the aisle was directed at Bovino and border patrol agents sent to Minneapolis along with ICE agents at Trump's directive. In total, there are more than 3,000 immigration agents in the city.

Carol Engelheart, a retired nurse from Minneapolis, said she has been deeply emotional about the events of the past few days.

""We need to care about this country, we need to care that we have a Constitution left, and if the people organize and the people stand up, we can do this,"" she said, as she chided immigration enforcement actions in the city.

Micayla Pretti, Alex Pretti's younger sister, released a statement on Monday, the Associated Press reported, calling her brother ""my hero"".

""When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?"" her statement said.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that it is the president's ""hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos"" in Minneapolis to end.

Trump ally Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, called Trump's decision to send Homan, to Minneapolis ""a very smart move"".

Also on Monday, Trump spoke will both Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - democratic leaders who have resisted the immigration efforts and demanded agents be removed from the state. Trump has criticised both in recent weeks.

Both Trump and the local leaders characterised the talks as positive and said they discussed a pathway forward - a sign that both sides were seeking a way to end their standoff over Trump's deportation drive.

Trump said he and Walz are ""on a similar wavelength"" and said his target is ""any and all criminals that they have in their possession"".

""The President agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and to talk to DHS about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,"" Walz said after the call.

Ensuring an independent investigation into Pretti's death, has been a central focus for Walz. In its immediate aftermath, local authorities obtained a judicial warrant to gain access to the crime scene to preserve evidence.

Local officials have condemned the federal government investigation and said they were not being allowed to access the crime scene and evidence following Pretti's death.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7253/live/7b78e7f0-fb1d-11f0-a47f-d352a7d9988a.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:57:59.224709

The House and Senate quickly gaveled in and out Monday due to the ongoing winter storm, and most members were absent as West Virginia is under a state of emergency.

In the GOP-controlled House, members had been expected to vote this week — as early as Tuesday — on a bill that would expand the state’s definitions of human trafficking, smuggling crimes, forced labor and more. The measure establishes specific felony penalties for the illegal transport of adults and minors.

House Bill 4433 defines human smuggling as transporting, isolating and harboring an illegal alien to avoid law enforcement.

“I believe that the federal government is attempting to enforce laws, but that doesn’t mean that the state cannot engage in activities to either facilitate what the federal government is doing or to ensure the protection of our citizens as well,” said bill sponsor Del. Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson.

Democratic House members are concerned that the bill could penalize church groups or nonprofit organizations helping undocumented immigrants, including giving them a ride to the grocery store.

“My concern is that these types of actions will subject people of faith to criminal penalties and time in jail,” said Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia.

As the House Judiciary Committee vetted the measure, Hansen asked, “Would they be involved in human smuggling based on this bill?”

Ridenour replied, “If they’re engaged in smuggling individuals into the state, then yes, they would be.”

On the House floor Friday, Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, attempted to amend the bill by editing the definition of human smuggling to include that it required an intent of financial or material benefit. Her amendment was in an effort to carve out protections for churches and individuals helping undocumented immigrants.

“I think we all want to go after people that are breaking the law,” Young said. “I want to make sure we’re targeting people that are profiting off of exploiting other people. This amendment clarifies that there would be a financial motive for people who are doing this for a capital gain.”

House Judiciary Chairman J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, said the amendment wasn’t necessary because the bill already provided a safeguard for people working with immigrants without criminal intent.

“If you are someone who receives grant services — a church for example, who is transporting immigrants who may have illegal status — you could then be criminally liable and culpable if we adopt this amendment,” Akers said. “You do not have criminal liability under this bill if your purpose is simply to provide transportation services to someone [or] do a favor for somebody.”

Akers added that the bill is in line with federal law on human smuggling. He urged rejection of Young’s amendment, and it was voted down.

The bill also requires that perpetrators pay restitution to adult and child victims of human trafficking regardless of their immigration status after Akers amended it on the House floor last week. A judge would decide what the restitution would be.

The House passed similar measures in 2024 and last year, citing the border crisis. The bills stayed parked in the Senate.

Lawmakers are scheduled to return to committee meetings and floor sessions on Tuesday.

West Virginians are encouraged to call 211, the state’s 24/7 call center, if they need help during the winter storm.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said West Virginia is dealing with a “a very dangerous cocktail” of ice, snow, sleet and cold temperatures. He has declared a State of Emergency for all 55 counties due to the winter storm that started over the weekend.

A lot has happened on the Supreme Court’s docket since my September preview, including six criminal law opinions on the merits (two by summary reversal – that is, without additional briefing and oral arguments), and 29 new grants of review (certiorari). Eight separate writings of individual justices in criminal cases have also appeared on the “Orders” docket. And of course last week saw oral arguments about Hawaii’s private-property-versus-gun-rights law. I should also mention two significant full court decisions on the interim docket that have “related to criminal law” implications: Trump v. Illinois (decided on Dec. 23, addressing Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Chicago) and Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo (decided on Sept. 8, addressing immigration detentions in Los Angeles, about which I wrote critically at the time).

With over half the term gone by, about half of the 58 cases in which the court has now granted review for the 2025-26 term present (by my broad definition) either criminal law questions or questions related to criminal law. The criminal law cases already decided, or added to the docket, since my pre-term preview are briefly summarized below.

Today’s column is informational rather than opinionated (for the most part) and presents short descriptions rather than lengthy analysis. As the court issues more final decisions, I expect that more analysis will come. (Meanwhile, you have no idea how many clicks putting in all the hyperlinks in this column takes.)

Decided cases

The court has now issued six decisions in criminal cases. The initial 9-0 vote count in five of the six is not unusual for the start of the merits docket – the “easy” decisions usually come first. Four of the six opinions favored the criminal defendant. Most intriguing are a few concurring opinions.

Case v. Montana (Jan. 14), Fourth Amendment

The justices unanimously endorsed a standard for warrantless entries into a home for law enforcement to provide “emergency aid,” rather than to search for criminal evidence. According to the court, law-enforcement officials need an “‘objectively reasonable basis for believing that someone inside needs emergency assistance,” which is different from “probable cause” or “reasonable suspicion” to investigate possible crimes. (Precisely how it differs remains to be settled, I think, in a future case.)

Most interesting in Case is Justice Neil Gorsuch’s short concurrence, in which he attacks what he calls “the miasma” and “confusion” created by the “reasonable expectation of privacy” standard that originated in the 1967 case of Katz v. United States. Gorsuch took his seat after the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Gorsuch praised as a “towering” figure and a “lion of the law.” Gorsuch predicted that Scalia’s approach to “the judicial role … will endure.” Yet in 2001 in a case called Kyllo v. United States, it was Scalia writing for the court who faithfully applied the Katz privacy analysis to rule that using technology outside of a house to monitor heat emanating from inside the house (to detect a suspected drug lab) was a Fourth Amendment “search” subject to the warrant requirement. Does Gorsuch’s Case concurrence portend that he will part ways with his professed mentor?

Barrett v. United States (Jan. 14), Double jeopardy

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored this unanimous decision, in a somewhat complicated federal statutory context. Imposing two convictions – one for a violation of a statute prohibiting possession of a gun in connection with a federal crime of violence and one for a violation of that same statute that also “causes … death” – violates the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against being “twice put in jeopardy” for “the same offense.” Both provisions have “the same elements” under the court’s 1932 decision in Blockburger v. United States, so they meet the court’s “same offense” standard. Because the court determined that Congress has not “clearly manifested” an intention to impose two separate convictions here, however, the two-conviction judgment below was reversed. (The question “whether Congress could” constitutionally authorize two convictions was reserved in a footnote.)

As in Case, Gorsuch wrote separately to note doctrinal “confusion,” this time regarding concurrent versus successive prosecutions for lesser and greater offenses. He’s right about that, I think. But he also says that a concurrent prosecution “for greater offenses and their lesser included variants” are “no double jeopardy problem … so long as the court does not enter judgments of conviction on both.” Perhaps the difference is one trial versus two, giving dispositive power to the word “twice” in the Fifth Amendment (that is, no person shall “be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb”). But why doesn’t a single trial for two “same offense” crimes itself constitute being “twice put in jeopardy,” especially if one variation of the crime permits introduction of evidence that the other might not? Gorsuch is right that “courts often tolerate the practice,” but such toleration does not settle the constitutional question.

Ellingburg v. United States (Jan. 20), Ex post facto laws

An easy unanimous decision: “restitution is criminal punishment” when imposed as a mandatory part of a criminal sentence. For that reason, in line with the ex post facto clause of the Constitution, courts may not be able to impose restitution (the case is remanded with the court’s usual closing phrasing “for further proceedings”) as part of a federal sentence for a crime that occurred before the law at issue was passed by Congress in 1996.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion was only five pages. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with “the Court’s opinion in full,” but (joined by Gorsuch) he added 17 pages of historical analysis to suggest that the court has strayed far from the rationale of its first ex post facto opinion, 1798’s Calder v. Bull. Thomas “would restore Calder’s approach” and reconsider “what laws would have been subject to the ex post facto clause,” including “[m]any laws that are nominally civil today.”

Bowe v. United States (Jan. 9), Federal habeas corpus

A very complicated and technical 5-4 decision, ruling that federal prisoners are not barred from filing “successive” (that is, repeated) petitions for post-conviction relief even though state prisoners are, and that the court has jurisdiction to reach that question. Gorsuch’s dissent was joined by Thomas and Alito, as well as by Justice Amy Coney Barrett in part, making Chief Justice John Roberts and Kavanaugh the dispositive votes in addition to the court’s three regular “liberal” justices.

Clark v. Sweeney (Nov. 14), Habeas corpus

In Clark , the court summarily reversed, without any noted dissents, the grant of a new trial in a Maryland murder case, on the ground that “the Court of Appeals departed dramatically from the principle of party presentation” (a practice in which courts usually consider only arguments presented to them by the parties). Last month, I wrote critically about this decision, which seems to transform this “principle” into a dispositive rule. (Sidenote: court observers sometimes indicate that there were “no noted dissents,” to honor the idea that justices might silently “go along” with a decision even if they do not agree with it. How often such theoretical “dissent aversion” actually occurs, if at all, is unknown.)

Pitts v. Mississippi (Nov. 14), Confrontation clause

A five-page summary reversal of the Mississippi Supreme Court, which had affirmed a trial court’s ruling that screening a young child abuse victim from view when testifying at trial was “mandatory.” Again, no dissents were noted. Two prior Supreme Court decisions permit such screening “only if a court hears evidence and issues a case-specific finding of … necessity,” which did not happen here. Thus, the court held that the Sixth Amendment right of a criminal defendant “to be confronted with the witnesses against him” was violated.

Nine new criminal or criminal-law-related cases added to the docket since September

By my criteria, five of the new cases granted for review involve “pure” criminal law issues. Another four present questions which I think are “related” to criminal law.

Five new “pure” criminal law cases

Wolford v. Lopez (argued Jan. 20), Second Amendment

A Hawaii law makes it unlawful to carry a firearm on private property, even if that property is generally open to the public and the bearer is licensed to carry the firearm, unless the property owner has given express permission. Does that law violate the Second Amendment’s “right of the people to keep and bear Arms” because it effectively means that lawful gun carriers cannot engage in day-to-day activities like visiting gas stations or coffee shops without explicit consent? Or is it honoring the long-standing right of private property owners to exclude others from their property? Based on oral argument, the court appears poised to side with the challengers to Hawaii’s law. But as usual, the significant points will be in the nuances of separate justices’ opinions. Exactly how far will a majority go in describing the limits of gun laws within the meaning of the Second Amendment?

United States v. Hemani (scheduled for argument March 2), Second Amendment

Is the federal statute (18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3)) that prohibits possession of a firearm by someone “who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance” unconstitutional? Ali Danial Hemani may, for purposes of argument, concede marijuana use, but he was not under the influence when arrested or when carrying his weapon, factors that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit has previously ruled are required. Last week’s oral argument in Wolford may shed some light on the arguments here, particularly regarding the use and limits of history (though a decision in Wolford before the oral argument seems unlikely).

Notably, the type of controlled substance in this particular case should be irrelevant to the Second Amendment question, even if the parties skirmish a bit on the point. The solicitor general’s petition for review said that “[t]his prosecution rests on respondent’s habitual use of marijuana” and presents the question presented as an “as applied to respondent” challenge. But the solicitor general also mentions use of cocaine and promethazine. Of potential interest: marijuana use is illegal in Texas (and under federal law), but has been decriminalized in over half of the states and the Trump administration has advocated changes to legalize “the medical use of marijuana.” We’ll see whether any of this comes up on March 2.

Hunter v. United States (scheduled for argument March 3), Appeal waivers in guilty pleas

This presents a longstanding and varied “split” among the federal courts of appeals. When criminal defendants have reached a “bargain” with the prosecution to plead guilty rather than go to trial (usually in exchange for some reduction in the charges), they are routinely asked, and regularly agree, to waive any appeal as part of the bargain (with an exception, perhaps, for an appeal argument that their lawyer has been ineffective or, sometimes, that the sentence imposed exceeds a statutory maximum). Moreover, some district judges later recite, when sentencing the defendant, that the defendant “has a right to appeal,” and some prosecutors fail to object to that line.

After entering such an agreement and pleading guilty, Munson Hunter filed an appeal challenging his sentence, but the 5th Circuit ruled that he had waived any such appeal and dismissed it.

Hunter’s petition for review says that that eight of the thirteen (or so) federal circuits have reached different conclusions regarding whether any implicit exceptions to such “appeal waivers” should be recognized (and whether a boilerplate statement that the defendant “has a right to appeal” renders a prior appeal waiver unenforceable). Both questions will be argued on March 3 (and you might especially enjoy hearing the feisty and experienced Supreme Court advocate Lisa Blatt arguing for Hunter).

Abouammo v. United States (argument likely in late March), Criminal venue

May a federal defendant be charged in a district where no conduct related to the offense occurred, if an effect of the conduct is contemplated in a different state? Here, California-based FBI agents visited Abouammo in Seattle, Washington; Abouammo then emailed them two false documents from Seattle, allegedly with intent to obstruct their California investigation.

Abouammo was charged, tried, and convicted in federal court in San Francisco for a false document crime “with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence [an] investigation” under 18 U.S.C. § 1519. Section 2 of Article III of the Constitution provides that “[t]he Trial of all Crimes … shall be held in the State where the said Crimes have been committed.” Does the intent to impede a California investigation, which Abouammo allegedly had when he emailed the documents from his home in Washington, satisfy this constitutional requirement? The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that the “contemplated effects” of Abouammo’s conduct made a California venue proper. We shall see if the Supreme Court agrees.

Chatrie v. United States (April argument likely), Fourth Amendment

Are “geofence” warrants constitutional? Since the use of cellphones became ubiquitous, law enforcement officers have developed a practice of asking cell providers for information regarding what users are reported as being located at the specific time and place of a crime. In this case, a detective in Virginia submitted a sworn affidavit and a magistrate issued a warrant to Google, finding “probable cause” to examine the data of its many millions of users and, in a number of steps, produce a list of the specific time that specific users were in a particular location during a credit union robbery. The evidence produced by that “geofence” warrant led to the identification and subsequent conviction of Okello Chatrie. State and federal courts are split as to whether such warrants are a “general search” prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.

Four new cases “related” to criminal law

FCC v. AT&T, consolidated with Verizon v. FCC (likely April argument), Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in civil cases

The solicitor general is the petitioner – that is, the litigant seeking Supreme Court review – in the first case; the court granted review and consolidated the case for briefing and oral argument with a similar private petition filed by Jeff Wall, an experienced Supreme Court advocate.

The Seventh Amendment provides that “[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.” The federal Communications Act of 1934 authorizes the FCC to levy monetary penalties without a jury trial. If the target entity pays, it gets federal judicial review but no trial by jury. If the entity decides not to pay, it may then receive a jury trial in federal court if the government sues to collect the money. The 5th Circuit ruled against the government in AT&T, holding that the initial assessment of a penalty without the involvement of an Article III federal court violates the Seventh Amendment (and Article III), while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled for the government in Verizon on the same issue.

Gorsuch has recently expressed concerns about the constitutional jury trial right in civil cases, concurring in 2024’s S.E.C. v. Jarkesy decision to ask the questions now granted review, and discussing it again in a statement regarding a denial of review earlier this term. My speculation is that his views have stimulated both the petitions and the grant of review in these cases.

Bondi v. Lau (April argument likely), Immigration law

The case appears to present a question about the timing of a finding of “inadmissibility” for a lawful permanent resident who has taken a trip abroad but has also committed a removable offense against the United States. The 2nd Circuit ruled that Lau was “improperly classified” by the government as “an applicant for admission” after he had been paroled into the United States two years earlier after a “brief trip” abroad while criminal charges were pending against him. The federal government’s petition for certiorari was granted on Jan. 9, but because the case was filed under federal secrecy rules, redacted filings have not yet been publicly linked on the court’s official docket (other than Lau’s opposition to that petition, publicly linked on Jan. 15).

Sripetch v. Securities Exchange Commission(April argument likely), Federal securities law

May the SEC seek equitable disgorgement without showing that individual investor-victims suffered pecuniary harm? The 9th Circuit ruled that it could, because disgorgement “is designed to deprive the wrongdoer of his ill-gotten gains,” so there is no need to show that the victim was harmed.

In this case, Sripetch pled guilty to criminal securities fraud and agreed to civil liability including disgorgement, but the “harm to victims” point was not addressed in that agreement. He later raised the issue, and the solicitor general agreed that a division among the federal courts of appeals on the question deserves review in this case. So here we are.

Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Doe I (April argument likely), Implied or private rights of action

Falun Gong practitioners filed suit seeking damages against Cisco under two federal laws: the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act. They alleged that Cisco had aided and abetted torture against them or their relatives in China by developing surveillance and other systems used to locate the plaintiffs. Cisco filed a petition for certiorari from the 9th Circuit’s ruling allowing the case to go forward, and (in response to a request from the court for the government’s views) the solicitor general agreed that the question whether either statute allows private lawsuits for aiding and abetting deserves review by the justices.

Trump v. Barbara (March or April?), Birthright citizenship and immigration law

Does the current president’s executive order, issued the day he was inaugurated, contravene the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, which states that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside”? The solicitor general argues that citizenship does not automatically descend upon “children of … illegal aliens.” Numerous federal courts have ruled that the court’s 1898 ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark says otherwise.

Opinions regarding dissents from denials of certiorari (review) by the court

In a separate section of its website entitled “Opinions Relating to Orders,” the court collects, among other things, separate opinions of justices issued when it as a body denies an application for a stay of a judgment (for example, an impending execution), or denies a petition for review of a case. (A shorthand term for such orders is “dissents from denials,” although sometimes a separate writing is designated a “statement” or “statement respecting” a denial, when a justice agrees with the decision to deny review but nonetheless writes an opinion outlining his or her views.) In fact, this part of the court’s website is a grab bag of different types of cases; some of the other rulings here comprise the “interim” (sometimes called “emergency” or “shadow”) docket that has received so much recent attention.

By my count, eight of the twelve separate cases listed in the court’s Orders section are “criminal law or related.” But this column is already too long to detail them; you’ll have to look for yourself or wait for my Annual Summary of Criminal Cases published by the ABA every August.

In particular, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been responsible for countless civil liberties and digital rights violations since that time. In the past year, however, ICE and CBP have descended into utter lawlessness, repeatedly refusing to exercise or submit to the democratic accountability required by the Constitution and our system of laws.

The Trump Administration has made indiscriminate immigration enforcement and mass deportation a key feature of its agenda, with little to no accountability for illegal actions by agents and agency officials. Over the past year, we’ve seen massive ICE raids in cities from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis. Supercharged by an unprecedented funding increase, immigration enforcement agents haven’t been limited to boots on the ground: they’ve been scanning faces, tracking neighborhood cell phone activity, and amassing surveillance tools to monitor immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.

The latest enforcement actions in Minnesota have led to federal immigration agents killing Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Both were engaged in their First Amendment right to observe and record law enforcement when they were killed. And it’s only because others similarly exercised their right to record that these killings were documented and widely exposed, countering false narratives the Trump Administration promoted in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable.

These constitutional violations are systemic, not one-offs. Just last week, the Associated Press reported a leaked ICE memo that authorizes agents to enter homes solely based on “administrative” warrants—lacking any judicial involvement. This government policy is contrary to the “very core” of the Fourth Amendment, which protects us against unreasonable search and seizure, especially in our own homes.

These violations must stop now. ICE and CBP have grown so disdainful of the rule of law that reforms or guardrails cannot suffice. We join with many others in saying that Congress must vote to reject any further funding of ICE and CBP this week. But that is not enough. It’s time for Congress to do the real work of rebuilding our immigration enforcement system from the ground up, so that it respects human rights (including digital rights) and human dignity, with real accountability for individual officers, their leadership, and the agency as a whole.",https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/blm-phones-2c.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:58:04.242732

[MUSIC PLAYING] NINA MOINI: Our top story on Minnesota Now, all morning, a federal judge has been hearing arguments on whether to temporarily halt immigration enforcement activity in the state. MPR news reporter, Estelle Timar-Wilcox has been listening to the hearing. She joins me with the latest. Thanks for your time, Estelle.

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Hi, Nina.

NINA MOINI: There are several ongoing lawsuits related to this immigration enforcement operation. Tell us what the court is hearing this morning.

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Yeah, this hearing this morning is in a lawsuit brought by the state and Minneapolis and St. Paul against the federal government. They're asking for a blanket stop to this immigration operation, or at least a temporary one. And basically, they're saying the federal government is overstepping its bounds and violating the state's constitutional right to govern itself. Attorneys with the US Department of Justice have called this frivolous and said this operation is within the federal government's right to enforce immigration law.

And what the state wants to get out of this is a temporary restraining order stopping this current surge of agents, bringing levels of ICE enforcement back down to what they were before this particular operation started in December. And this hearing started this morning at 9:00. They just went into recess about 15 minutes ago after hearing from attorneys on both sides. Federal judge, Katherine Menendez, says she's not sure when she-- or she didn't say when she plans to issue a ruling. But she said she's juggling some constitutional questions here and wants to consider it really carefully. And attorneys for the state are urged her to issue an order soon, since the situation is so tense.

NINA MOINI: The federal government has the right to enforce immigration. But why does the state say this particular operation is overstepping?

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Well, first, they're arguing it's overwhelming state resources. They said police have seen an uptick in 911 calls as people call for help related to federal immigration operations. Schools have reported lower attendance rates. Some hospitals and clinics say federal agents inside are scaring people and interfering with care. And of course, now we've also seen three shootings of local residents by federal agents, two of those fatal. And in addition to that argument that it's overwhelming state resources, attorneys also say the federal government is essentially using this operation to coerce the state to change its immigration enforcement practices.

Lawyers for the state this morning pointed to a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Tim Walz this weekend, in which she asks for access to state records on residents and also said the state needs to end what she calls sanctuary policies. That's those policies that limit local law enforcement from collaborating with immigration enforcement. The state says that's also unconstitutional and violates the state's rights to make its own laws.

NINA MOINI: And this is one of several lawsuits in progress, again, over this current immigration operation. There's another hearing in federal court this afternoon. What can we expect out of that?

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Yeah, that's a hearing scheduled at 2:00 in a separate case. The state and Hennepin County attorneys are asking the federal government to preserve evidence related to Saturday's shooting of Alex Pretti. Federal officials have started that investigation into the shooting. But state officials have not yet been able to see that evidence. A federal judge issued an order in this case on Saturday blocking the Trump administration from destroying or altering any of that evidence. And we'll hear more about this at the hearing this afternoon.

NINA MOINI: So while officials wait for those court rulings, what is next for the federal government's operation here? Do you have a sense for that?

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Well, we've gotten a little bit of word on this this morning. President Trump announced that he's sending border czar, Tom Homan, to the state to oversee ICE operations and report directly back to the president. He's expected to get in tonight. Trump and Walz also said this morning that they had a phone call about the operation, which Trump categorized as quote, ""very good."" He said he's on the same page with the governor about toning down tension. Walz called the talk productive and said he pushed Trump to decrease the presence of federal law enforcement here and also to let federal let local law enforcement investigate the shootings in Minneapolis. And according to Walz, Trump agreed to take those requests to his administration. That's the first time they've talked to each other about this operation after a tense couple of weeks and the two trading insults back and forth.

NINA MOINI: All right, Estelle. Thanks for that update.

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: You're welcome, Nina.

NINA MOINI: That's MPR News reporter, Estelle Timar-Wilcox.

While ICE officials have been silent in confirming that such a plan exists, The Washington Post recently reported that ICE is considering converting a warehouse in Hutchins that would house 9,500 detainees.

The group on Friday expressed a call to action for residents and religious leaders in Dallas County to reach out to lawmakers, to urge them to not support ""the warehousing of thousands of migrants in inhumane conditions in our backyard.”

""We should not be housing human beings in warehouses meant for packages,"" said Eric Folkerth, lead pastor of the Kessler Park United Methodist Church, where the press conference was held.

Carl Sherman, a former Hutchins city manager and former state representative for Texas District 109, which includes Hutchins, spoke about the impact the facility would have on the community.

""I can tell you that Hutchins does not have the infrastructure, does not the water supply, or the sewage infrastructure to sustain and accommodate the more than doubling of its current population by 150%,” Sherman said.

He and other speakers asked community members to support Hutchins residents and leaders — including Mayor Mario Vasquez — who do not want the ICE detention facility in their city.

“Local leaders must be empowered to plan and approve projects in their communities,"" Sherman said. “If you just can't imagine that it would ever happen in your home, your small town like Hutchins could be the next city, the next community that faces this.""

Meanwhile, two local faith leaders — Mara Richards Bim, Justice and Advocacy Fellow at the Royal Lane Baptist Church, and T.J. Fitzgerald, reverend of the First Unitarian Church of Dallas — were in Minneapolis and St. Paul Friday as part of a larger gathering to oppose ICE activity in Minnesota. They were there to meet with hundreds of leaders from around the country.

Dallas Rabbi Nancy Kasten said it’s important to work past ideological differences to plan, collaborate and cooperate.

“We in Dallas must work together to meet the moment when, not if, it arrives in our streets and at our doorsteps,” she said.

However, repeated reports of excessive force, inhumane detention conditions, and aggressive tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have raised serious concerns about civil rights and due process. For immigrant communities, ICE brutality is not a policy debate. It is a daily reality with lasting emotional and legal consequences.

What Is ICE Brutality?

ICE brutality refers to the use of excessive force, intimidation, or abusive practices by immigration enforcement officers during arrests, raids, transportation, or detention. This can include physical violence, verbal threats, unlawful arrests, and denial of basic rights while in custody. These actions often occur during high stress enforcement operations where individuals are already vulnerable.

Common Examples of ICE Abuse and Excessive Force

Reports and client experiences reveal recurring patterns of ICE misconduct, including:

Early morning home raids without valid judicial warrants

Arrests of individuals with pending immigration applications or legal relief

Use of force against nonviolent individuals

Detention of parents in front of minor children

Failure to provide translators or explain legal rights

Denial of medical care in detention facilities

These practices can escalate quickly and cause severe psychological and physical harm.

Immigrants’ Rights During ICE Encounters

Regardless of immigration status, individuals in the United States are protected by the U.S. Constitution. These rights apply during encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including at home, in public spaces, and at the workplace. Understanding these protections can help prevent unlawful searches, arrests, and coercive questioning.

In most situations, immigrants have the right to remain silent and are not required to answer questions about their immigration status, country of origin, or how they entered the United States. Individuals also have the right to refuse to sign documents they do not understand or that have not been reviewed by an attorney. Silence cannot legally be used as evidence of wrongdoing.

ICE officers generally may not enter a home without a valid judicial warrant signed by a judge. Administrative warrants issued by the Department of Homeland Security do not authorize entry into a private residence without consent. Individuals have the right to ask officers to show a warrant and to review it before opening the door. They may also refuse entry if the warrant is not judicial or does not list the correct address or individual.

Immigrants also have the right to speak with an attorney. While the government does not provide free immigration attorneys, individuals may request time to contact legal counsel before answering questions or participating in proceedings. Access to an attorney is a critical safeguard, especially during detention or removal proceedings.

ICE officers are required to follow due process and constitutional limits when conducting arrests, searches, and detentions. This includes limits on the use of force, requirements for lawful probable cause, and obligations to respect basic civil rights. When these limits are ignored, enforcement actions may become unlawful.

If ICE violates an individual’s rights, it may be possible to challenge the legality of the arrest, detention, or evidence obtained as a result. In some cases, constitutional violations can support motions to suppress evidence or other legal remedies in immigration court. Documenting the encounter and seeking legal counsel as soon as possible is essential to protecting these rights.

Knowing and asserting one’s rights during an ICE encounter can make a meaningful difference in the outcome of a case and in safeguarding long term legal options.

ICE Detention Conditions and Human Rights Concerns

ICE detention is a civil process, not a criminal punishment. Yet many detainees are held in conditions that resemble incarceration. Common issues include overcrowding, prolonged detention without hearings, inadequate medical treatment, and the use of solitary confinement. For asylum seekers and individuals with no criminal history, these conditions can be especially harmful and retraumatizing.

Legal Consequences of ICE Misconduct

When ICE officers engage in brutality or unlawful conduct, it can impact immigration cases. Evidence obtained through coercion or abuse may be challenged. In some situations, constitutional violations can support motions to suppress evidence or terminate proceedings. Documenting misconduct and seeking legal counsel as early as possible is critical.

How an Immigration Attorney Can Help After ICE Abuse

When an individual experiences abuse, excessive force, or unlawful treatment by ICE, having an experienced immigration attorney involved as early as possible is critical. An attorney can carefully review the circumstances of the arrest, raid, or detention to determine whether ICE officers complied with constitutional protections, agency regulations, and due process requirements.

Legal counsel can assess whether the arrest was supported by a valid warrant, whether consent was unlawfully coerced, and whether any statements or evidence were obtained through intimidation or force. If violations occurred, an attorney may be able to challenge the legality of the arrest, file motions to suppress unlawfully obtained evidence, or seek termination of removal proceedings in appropriate cases.

In addition, an immigration attorney can assist with securing bond or parole from detention, advocating for release based on humanitarian factors, family ties, or lack of flight risk. Counsel can also identify and pursue available forms of relief from removal, including asylum, cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, or other protections depending on the individual’s circumstances.

Attorneys may also help document abuse or misconduct by filing formal complaints with oversight agencies and preserving evidence that may be relevant to both immigration and civil rights claims. Just as importantly, legal representation provides guidance and stability during a highly stressful and intimidating process, ensuring that individuals understand their rights and options at every stage.

Early legal intervention often makes a decisive difference. The sooner an attorney becomes involved, the more effectively they can protect an individual’s rights, prevent further harm, and build a strategic defense aimed at safeguarding their future and their family.

At Rebecca Black Law, P.A., our legal work consistently reveals the serious personal and legal consequences of aggressive immigration enforcement. Families are separated, survivors of trauma are retraumatized, and long term community members are placed into removal proceedings with little warning. Our commitment is to defend our clients and ensure their rights are respected at every stage of the process.

When to Seek Legal Help After an ICE Encounter

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has not issued a statement on the shooting and his office has not responded to ABC News' requests for comment.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune issued a statement on Monday that did not directly address the shooting but applauded the White House dispatching border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota in hopes of ""turning down the temperature,"" while encouraging Minnesota officials to work with the Trump administration in getting ""dangerous criminals off America's streets.""

At least eight GOP senators said they support an investigation into the shooting, including Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick -- a Trump ally.

ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.""

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy called for a joint state and federal investigation into the shooting -- warning ""the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

While he did not call for an investigation, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz criticized the administration's rhetoric on the shooting.

""What I think the administration could do better is the tone with which they're describing this -- that immediately when an incident like this happens, they come out guns blazing that we took out a violent terrorist, hooray,"" Cruz said on his podcast ""Verdict with Ted Cruz"" on Monday.

More than a dozen House GOP lawmakers echoed similar sentiments, including House Homeland Security Chairman Andrew Garbarino, who expects a ""full investigation"" into the shooting.

""CBP and ICE have already been invited, and I expect each to testify before the Committee in the coming weeks. It is critical that Congress conduct its due diligence to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers and the communities they protect. I take my oversight duties of the Department of Homeland Security seriously, and we expect recent events to be thoroughly discussed at our hearing,"" Garbarino said in a statement.

Moderate New York Rep. Mike Lawler called for an independent investigation into the shooting but said calls to ""abolish"" ICE are ""misguided.""

""Let this be a moment for Americans of common sense and good will to come together and work towards a solution,"" he said.

Despite this, several Republicans have also rushed to the Trump administration's defense.

Earlier this month, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem secretly imposed a policy requiring that members of Congress provide seven days’ notice before being granted access to these facilities. Under federal law, however, all members of Congress have the right to conduct unannounced oversight of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities used for immigration detention, including facilities run by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and those operated by private companies.

In a statement, Congressman Crow and other lawsuit plaintiffs said:

“The Trump administration is using billions of taxpayer dollars to carry out a violent and lawless immigration agenda with virtually no transparency or accountability. This is not only deeply dangerous — it is an affront to the rule of law and to our constitutional duty as Members of Congress. 2025 marked the deadliest year for those in ICE custody in more than two decades, with record detentions and mounting reports of abuse and inhumane conditions. We can’t turn a blind eye. We are returning to court to restore congressional oversight and hold this administration accountable to the American people.”

In July 2025, Congressman Crow sued the Trump Administration to uphold his right to conduct oversight of these facilities following his unlawful denial from a detention facility in Aurora.

Additional Members of Congress who were denied access to federal immigration detention facilities joined Crow as plaintiffs in the lawsuit: Representatives Joe Neguse (D-CO-02), Jamie Raskin (D-MD-08), Bennie Thompson (D-MS-02), Veronica Escobar (D-TX-16), Dan Goldman (D-NY-10), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY-13), Jimmy Gomez (D-CA-34), Norma Torres (D-CA-35), Raul Ruiz (D-CA-36), Robert Garcia (D-CA-42), Lou Correa (D-CA-46), and Kelly Morrison (MN-03).

Since his election to Congress, Crow has fought to promote transparency, oversight, and accountability in federal immigration detention centers. He introduced bipartisan legislation guaranteeing Members of Congress the right to conduct unannounced, in-person oversight visits of ICE detention facilities, including to check on any concerns related to public health and the humane treatment of detained individuals.

Crow regularly conducts oversight of Aurora’s immigration detention facility. Since 2019, he has visited the facility to conduct oversight ten times.

Failing to provide these basic necessities, CHIRLA says in court documents, amounts to punishment — violating detainees rights to due process.

“ We are really at a moment where we are seeing a human rights crisis right before our eyes,” CHIRLA policy director Jeanette Zanipatin said at a news conference Monday. “And the detention centers, especially the one at Adelanto, is where we are seeing it unfold in real time.”

Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.

”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.

ICE and Homeland Security have not responded to LAist about the case or claims in this article.

A question of constitutional rights

When CHIRLA announced the lawsuit on Monday, Zanipatin said there has been “a long history of unsafe and abusive conditions” at the Adelanto facility. She referenced a July 2025 report from the nonprofit Disability Rights California that found conditions at the facility were “dangerous and inadequate for all people, especially for those with disabilities.”

Court documents filed by CHIRLA also reference previous reports that found issues at the facility, including a 2018 report from the DHS Office of Inspector General that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”

Those issues included findings of nooses in detainees’ cells, improper use of disciplinary segregation and inadequate medical care.

“Based on interviews with detainees and medical staff and a review of independent reports,” the report states, “we concluded that detainees do not have timely access to proper medical care.”

CHIRLA claims in their lawsuit that Adelanto leadership rejected the findings of the inspector general report and took no corrective action.

The concerns raised by CHIRLA as they announced the lawsuit closely resemble the findings of Disability Rights California, which also claimed detainees were not provided adequate medical care, food, water or clean clothing. The organization also reported that some people had limited access to communication with their loved ones.

Huerta claimed that the conditions in the Adelanto facility are poor by design.

“ Adelanto, like most ICE prisons, is engineered to be so punishing, so relentlessly soul crushing, that people abandon their rights and accept deportation even when they have strong asylum claims or a clear pathway to legal status,” Huerta said.

He said 32 people died while detained by ICE nationwide in 2025, and at least 6 more have died in January. Two people died at Adelanto last fall, Huerta said.

Family members speak out

Mariel Garcia told LAist she would call her father, Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, nearly every day. That ended when he was detained by immigration agents in Costa Mesa on Oct. 14.

Garcia-Aviles had a work permit, his daughter said, but he was detained and taken to Adelanto. She said she tried many times to ask the facility staff to allow her to call her father, or even to get an update on his condition, but she was never able to talk to him again.

Worried, she said she got a call from the staff at Adelanto.

“ They called me the day he was passing away,” Garcia told LAist, “They're like, go tell your family and friends to come and say their last goodbyes because your father's in critical condition.”

Her brother, Gabriel Garcia, said that when they arrived at the hospital their father was intubated and “lifeless."" Still, he said, there were law enforcement officers standing outside the hospital room.

Garcia-Aviles died Oct. 23 at age 56.

Jose Ayala also talked about the loss of his brother, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, while he was detained in the Adelanto facility.

“ He was there for about a month and we knew nothing of his condition,” Ayala said at Monday’s press conference, “just that he was sick and that he wasn't getting any help when he asked.”

Ayala said his family learned of his brother’s death when the police came and knocked at their door. He said staff at Adelanto did not tell them Ayala-Uribe had been hospitalized or that he needed a surgery, which ICE said in a news release was for an abscess.

Ayala told LAist that he was able to talk with his brother over the phone a couple of times when he was detained, and Ayala-Uribe was joking with him about the poor conditions of the facility causing him to lose weight.

“ One of the last things he told me,” Ayala recalled, “was, ‘We'll see who comes out skinnier.’”

He said his brother was 39 when he died on Sept. 22, 2025.

CHIRLA alleges in court documents that staff at Adelanto were aware Ayala-Uribe was having a potentially life-threatening medical emergency three days before his death, but he was taken back to his cell after being seen by the facility’s medical team.

An ICE news release said Ayala-Uribe “was evaluated by an on-call medical provider Sept. 18, provided medication, and returned to his dormitory,” but did not mention the severity of his condition.

The cause of both deaths remain under investigation, CHIRLA said in an accompanying news release.

Big Bear’s famous bald eagle couple, Jackie and Shadow, now have a pair of eggs to look after.

Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.

More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie welcomed the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.

The season so far

Jackie laid the first egg around 4:30 p.m. Friday, with Shadow stopping by to see it for the first time about 10 minutes later, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley records.

It was almost exactly a year after the feathered duo welcomed the first egg of the 2025 season.

Jackie tends to lay eggs three days apart, and the second egg arrived right on schedule.

Jackie could be seen rousing and puffing up her feathers about a half-hour before laying the second egg. She made a high-pitched whistling tea kettle noise a little before 5 p.m. Monday.

Officials from Friends of Big Bear Valley have told LAist those behaviors are signs an egg is imminent.

“She looks almost royal, because all of her feathers are out and it's just — I cry,” Jenny Voisard, the organization’s media and website manager, said with a laugh last week. “It's usually pretty amazing.”

The eagle pair typically takes turns caring for their eggs. Shadow visited the nest for nearly three hours across nine incubation “daddy duty” sessions on Sunday, according to organization records.

What’s ahead for the nest

Jackie has laid up to three eggs in a clutch, including in each of the past two seasons, so fans could see another egg arrive this week.

A clutch refers to the group of eggs laid in each nesting attempt. Bald eagles generally have one clutch per season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. A second clutch is possible if the eggs don’t make it through the early incubation process.

For example, Jackie laid a second clutch in February 2021 after the first round of eggs was broken or destroyed by ravens the month before.

The Big Bear eagles also practice delayed incubation, which is when Jackie and Shadow don’t apply their full body heat to the eggs until the whole clutch is laid.

Waiting to incubate full time helps the eggs hatch closer together, making the chicks more similar in size and age, which the organization says gives them a better chance of survival.

Jackie and Shadow successfully delayed incubation for their trio of eggs last season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. Sunny and Gizmo hatched and later went on to fledge, or fly away from the nest for the first time, last summer.

Chicks? Chicks soon??

Once egg-laying is over, the chick countdown is on.

Jackie and Shadow's usual incubation time is around 35 to 39 days, starting when the eagles begin to fully incubate their clutch, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley.

Last season, the first egg hatched at around 40 days old, the second egg hatched around 38 days old and the third egg around 39 days old.

“Pip Watch” — short for pipping, which is the first hole an eaglet makes as it emerges from its egg — is typically announced by Friends of Big Bear Valley before chicks break through each season.

Last year’s Pip Watch kicked off in March, a few days before the first chick hatched in the nest.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

The killing of another protester by immigration agents in Minneapolis and President Trump's ongoing threats against Greenland have fueled calls to boycott World Cup matches held in the U.S. this summer — including in Los Angeles.

The suggestion from a former FIFA president and others led some in City Hall to worry that the coming 2028 Olympics could also get the cold shoulder.

""We have a national government who is setting the stage for an environment where we could have a serious boycott,"" Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson said during a committee meeting on the Olympic Games Monday.

John Harper, an executive with private Olympics organizing committee LA28, said that the organization had not discussed the possibility with the International Olympic Committee and that he was not concerned a boycott would take place in 2028.

City Council members did not seem convinced.

""This conversation around FIFA, that's just a forewarning,"" said Councilmember Monica Rodriguez. ""We need to have a Plan B.""

The city of Los Angeles stands to lose if spectators or countries opt out of the 2028 Olympics. L.A. is the financial guarantor of the Games, along with the state of California, and a significant boycott could affect the financial success of the massive sporting event.

""We could be talking about a lot more irreparable harm, financially,"" Rodriguez said.

Fresh concerns about a boycott also come as anxiety in City Hall has been growing about the role the federal government will play at the Games.

The City Council recently passed a motion requesting that LA28 provide more details on the federal Olympics task force on security that Trump announced last year, citing the ICE agents who have descended on the streets of Los Angeles and other U.S. cities

The Olympics have been a frequent arena of political protest over the decades, including in Los Angeles in 1984 when the Soviet Union led a boycott of the Games.

""We never talk about the boycott of '84, but there was a significant boycott,"" Harris-Dawson said Monday. ""It doesn't mean that you can't figure it out, but it also means we have to face it and face it directly.""",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3bd056/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9504x4990+0+755/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2Ffe%2Fc0d1a9f64bf6b96e1f980dbb7062%2Fa7r09021.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:02.883234

INK LINK ESSAYS

By Arnold Mikolo

I have always believed from the moment I was first exposed to the idea of America that no matter your race, country of origin, religion, or nationality, this nation is a place where you can write your own destiny. That belief is more than an aspiration. It sits at the very core of how the United States was founded on the bedrock principle that we are all created equal.

My journey from the Congo to the United States could only be possible here. Only in this country could someone arrive with little more than hope, determination, and faith in opportunity and begin to build a life. America made my story possible not because it is perfect, but because its promise insists that opportunity belongs to everyone.

That promise aligns deeply with the vision of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Dr. King understood that democracy could not endure if dignity was reserved for only some. That is why he supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which dismantled race-based immigration quotas that favored Northern Europeans while excluding people from Africa, Asia, and much of the Global South. He viewed those quotas as incompatible with American democracy and civil rights. For Dr. King, human dignity did not depend on nationality, accent, or place of birth.

As I reflected on this Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I am struck by how far we have come and how fragile that progress remains. Each year, we gather to recite Dr. King’s words. His speeches are quoted. His dreams are celebrated. His legacy is honored.

Yet too often, those words feel disconnected from our actions.

When I arrived in the United States in 2012, I came through what many now dismiss as ancient history, a green card process that once represented a clear pathway for people seeking opportunity. Today, immigrants are often portrayed as burdens, as takers, or as threats to the very nation they help sustain.

That narrative is not only inaccurate. It is dangerous.

The immigrants I know are hard workers. They come seeking opportunity, not charity. They come because they believe in this country. This nation was built on the backs of enslaved Africans, and it continues to be sustained by farmworkers, caregivers, laborers, service workers, and essential employees, many of whom are immigrants. Our food is grown by immigrant hands. Our economy is strengthened by immigrant labor. Our communities are enriched by immigrant families.

Dr. King understood this truth. He stood in solidarity with migrant workers, supported César Chávez and the United Farm Workers, and rejected fear driven politics that scapegoated the most vulnerable. He believed civil rights and immigrant rights were morally connected, and that justice requires solidarity across race, nationality, and class.

Today, I have the honor of leading one of the largest and oldest civil rights organizations in the United States, the Greater Manchester NAACP. Ten years ago, this was not something I could have imagined. As a young immigrant with an accent, I might have believed I was not qualified or expected to one day help lead such an institution. Yet here I am. In many ways, this is my own I Have a Dream moment.

The NAACP predates Dr. King’s time. With more than 117 years of history, it is an institution built by leaders I admire and consider heroes. It is the same organization Dr. King was a part of and worked through to secure and expand our civil rights. To now stand in that lineage is both humbling and grounding. It forces me to reflect on how far we have come and on the responsibility that comes with progress. I say this with certainty. Only in the United States of America could my story be possible. My story is the American story.

But progress is never permanent.

There is a poem that has stayed with me over the years. First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for me.

That poem is not simply a warning from history. It is a mirror held up to our present moment.

Today, immigrants are targeted. Asylum seekers are vilified. Communities are divided by language, legal status, and fear. Too often, silence follows because the people being targeted do not look like us, do not speak like us, or do not share our background.

But Dr. King warned us plainly that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

If we do not stand up when our immigrant neighbors are targeted, when their rights are stripped away, and when families are separated, we weaken the very foundation of civil rights for everyone. Today, it may be your neighbor. Tomorrow it may be you, and there may be no one left to stand up or speak out on your behalf.

Still, I hold on to hope.

When I was young in Congo, during a time of unrest and violence, rebel groups advanced, and communities lived in fear. I do not remember every detail, but I remember this. Neighbors protected one another. When rumors spread that foreigners were being targeted, people stood together. They refused to let anyone be taken. They chose community over fear.

That memory shapes my hope today.

It reminds me that even in moments of uncertainty, we can choose solidarity. We can choose courage. We can choose to protect one another.

As we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day and prepare to enter Black History Month, we must ask ourselves what we will say about this moment five years from now. Will we say we remained silent, or that we stood together? Will we say we allowed fear to divide us, or that we honored Dr. King’s legacy through action?

This is the unfinished work of Dr. King. This is the fight he waged not only for those born here, but for people like me, someone who came to this country with one hundred dollars in his pocket and an unshakable belief in what America could be.

The sun still rises. And with it comes another chance to live up to the promise we so often quote, but must now work together to keep.",https://media-manchester.inklink.news/app/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26075400/mikolo2.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:58:18.113936

The surge of agents to Minneapolis has resulted in waves of protest, legal action, and political backlash against the Trump administration, especially after the shooting deaths of two American citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, at the hands of federal immigration agents.

In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters on Monday, Gov.

The video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far contradict that assertion. The Trump administration has not provided evidence to support Bovino's claims.

The state's legal team pointed to a social media post from President Trump in which he promised a day of ""RECKONING & RETRIBUTION"" for Minnesota, and to a letter sent to the state over the weekend by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, which they characterized as a ""ransom note"" offering to end the DHS surge in exchange for voter registration records and the end of the state's sanctuary policies.

Representatives for the Trump administration told the judge that the letter simply acknowledges the fact that, without sanctuary policies, the federal government would not have to send as many officers into the state.

The U.S. District Court judge overseeing the case, Katherine Menendez, declined to grant a restraining order in the state's case. She requested additional court filings from Trump administration lawyers by Wednesday.

The U.S. District Court judge overseeing the case, Katherine Menendez, declined to grant a restraining order in the state's case.

Maher Tarabishi has been in ICE custody since late October and remains at the Blubonnet Detention Facility in Anson, about 200 miles west of Dallas.

HIs son, 30-year-old Wael Tarabishi, died over the weekend after a month in the ICU at Mansfield Medical Center from complications related to Pompe disease, a rare genetic condition. He had been hospitalized in December for a stomach infection.

According to a news release sent to KERA from the Tarabishi family, Wael became unconscious after his second surgery.

“He passed without his beloved father, primary caregiver and constant life companion, Maher by his side,” read a statement by Tarabishi family on social media.

Maher Tarabishi was detained after his annual check-in at the Dallas ICE Field office on Oct 28. He came to the U.S. from Jordan in1994.

His family is now asking for Maher’s humanitarian release so he can attend his son’s funeral.

Tarabishi’s daughter-in-law, Shahd Arnaout has asked via social media for a call to action for people to reach out to elected officials, to help Maher attend his son’s funeral.

“I feel like this is all on ICE, because if my father-in-law was next to him right now, none of that would happen,” Arnaout told KERA last month.

A statement from the Tarabishi family on social media said they recently found out Maher’s asylum case had been denied because the attorney that filed his original asylum case had been fraudulently practicing law without a license.

It was uncovered during a thorough review of the case following the start of Tarabishi’s current ICE detention, read the statement. The family’s attorney Ali Elhorr filed a motion with the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen the case.

“Like the other victims of this fraudulent attorney, Maher’s immigration case was denied and he was ordered removed based on the asylum application that was filed on his behalf,” the statement read.

In a statement last month, an ICE representative alleged Tarabishi was a “self-admitted member of the Palestine Liberation Organization,” the internationally recognized representative of Palestinians.

The family has called ICE’s allegations “untrue, defamatory claims” to keep Maher from his son during the last moments of his life.

The options include potentially having the House return at the end of the week to approve a modified package of bills to avoid a partial government shutdown should it come to that. The House left Washington last week, expecting the Senate to pass the package of bills this week. Then, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend — significantly changing postures on Capitol Hill.

Aides emphasized that the dynamics fundamentally shifted over the last 72 hours. On Friday, no one was anticipating a government shutdown. By Saturday night, it became clear that there may be little way to avoid one.

The White House and GOP senators have begun initial outreach to Democrats to find a way out of shuttering the major federal agencies by week’s end, according to senior aides, but so far there’s no indication a shutdown crisis will be averted by the January 30 deadline.

Democrats want major changes to how US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is operating as a condition for voting on a funding package that would provide money to major federal agencies, such as the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services.

“Republicans and the White House have reached out but have not yet raised any realistic solutions,” one Senate Democratic leadership aide said.

There are several potential options to avoid a shutdown, including stripping out funding for the Department of Homeland Security and separately moving the rest of the bills. But that would require the consent of all 100 senators after they return to Capitol Hill Tuesday — and would hinge on an agreement being reached by Senate Democrats and the White House, which has said it opposes separating the bills in the package.

Maine Republican Susan Collins, the Senate’s top appropriator, said that removing the DHS bill from the broader package “certainly would not be [her] first choice.”

“I think there might be a way to add some further reforms or procedural protections, but those discussions are ongoing,” she told reporters in the Capitol Monday, adding they would involve Senate Majority Leader John Thune.

Still, Republicans say they are exploring all options as it relates to Democratic demands to strip the DHS bill out of the six-bill appropriations package already passed by the House. A top goal, they say, is to prevent a shutdown of what amounts to 75% of the government’s spending.

For their part, Democrats are trying to coalesce around a single set of demands, but a source familiar with those talks said conversations about what kinds of reforms Democrats will seek as it pertains to DHS are still ongoing. Democratic leaders are still soliciting suggestions and ideas from their members.

A quick compromise between the parties on changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be difficult, however. Many Republicans would likely oppose the types of changes to ICE that Democrats are demanding.

Nothing is at all finalized and discussions on next steps are preliminary.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress.","Updated January 26, 2026 at 7:07 PM EST

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown are condemning President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota and say they’re preparing legal options to fight back if a similar operation ramps up in Washington.

At a news conference Monday morning, Ferguson said state officials cannot stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement from operating here.

But he denounced ICE’s tactics — including masked agents snatching people off the streets and breaking into homes without judicial warrants — as “deeply un-American” and “most certainly unconstitutional.”

Ferguson and Brown warned that they’ll be ready to file lawsuits and take other actions to hold the Trump administration — and individual ICE agents — accountable if they violate the rights of people in Washington state.

The news conference at the state Capitol had been scheduled before the weekend killing in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old man who was shot to death by federal immigration agents.

Ferguson and Brown said Pretti’s death, and the dishonest response to it by Trump and his allies, reinforces how dire a spot the country is in.

“The recent events in Minnesota have taken this un-American activity to an entirely different level,” Ferguson said. “Now, they are killing Americans for holding a camera. ICE is, to be blunt, completely and totally out of control.”

Brown said Trump’s deportation actions in Minnesota have only made that state less safe.

“America is weaker because of the operations in Minnesota, and real people all across this country are now traumatized, injured and dead because of this president’s fascist tendencies,” Brown said.

“What we’re seeing right now coming from Washington, D.C., is motivated by hate and bias, and it’s guided by the whims of the president, not the facts, not the courts, and certainly not the United States Constitution,” he said.

King County and the City of Seattle on Monday signed on in support of Minnesota’s lawsuit seeking to halt the massive deployment of immigration agents to the state. Minnesota, in a court hearing Monday morning, argued that the enforcement was a campaign of “retribution” and asked a judge to stop the federal operation.

In an amicus brief joined by dozens of cities and local governments, Seattle and King County wrote that ICE’s surge in Minnesota amounted to “a military occupation of the Twin Cities.”

They argued ICE’s actions exceed the authority granted by the Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

“The presence of militarized, unidentifiable agents is not making our communities safer,” King County Executive Girmay Zahilay said, “and is instead creating chaos and distrust.”

While Ferguson said he had no new information about any Minnesota-like ICE escalation in Washington, he outlined several steps, some that had already been announced, that his office is pursuing to hold ICE accountable.

He urged state lawmakers to quickly pass a bill that would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks. He said he’s adding the head of the state’s office of immigration assistance to his cabinet meetings and has hired a senior immigration policy adviser.

Ferguson also said he met with Maj. Gen. Gent Welsh, the head of the Washington National Guard, about options for deploying the guard as a “buffer” between federal agents and protesters in the event of a federal ICE escalation here.

He and Brown also rebuked Trump and top administration officials for lying about the Pretti shooting.

Ferguson said he supports people who are tracking ICE activities, pointing to videos that have contradicted the administration’s claims about the Minnesota shooting. He said footage shot by observers is “deeply helpful” in the face of “the lies that came from federal officials.”

Pretti was armed with a pistol, for which he had a legal permit, but video shows he was holding a phone when confronted by agents, who wrestled him to the ground, removed the gun from his hip, and then shot him several times.

His death spurred renewed national protests, including in Seattle, where hundreds took to the streets on Saturday.

Pretti was the second person to be killed by a federal agent in Minneapolis in recent weeks amid major protests over an aggressive immigration crackdown carried out by masked agents.

Renee Good, an unarmed 37-year-old woman, was killed on Jan. 7 as she attempted to drive away from agents in her Honda Pilot.

Trump administration officials have defended the shootings and reportedly moved to block independent investigations into the deaths, asserting that federal agents have broad legal immunity. They’ve also blamed the killings on protesters and on Democratic leaders in Minnesota and nationally.

On Sunday, Trump doubled down on his deportation tactics, demanding that Democratic-led states cooperate with the federal government to “enforce our nation’s laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of division, chaos and violence.”

Ferguson and Brown had initially scheduled Monday’s news conference to respond in large part to a leaked ICE memo that claims its agents do not have to wait for a signed judicial warrant before busting into people’s houses.

Federal immigration officers have asserted they have the power to forcibly enter homes without a judge’s warrant, The Associated Press reported last week, citing an internal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement memo.

The stance is a sharp reversal from longstanding guidance meant to respect the constitutional rights of people during government searches.

The memo says ICE officers can use force, such as breaking down doors, to enter a residence based solely on narrower administrative warrants to arrest someone with a final order of removal.

Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown have issued a strong condemnation of recent federal immigration enforcement actions following the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota.

During a news conference held Monday morning in the Governor’s Conference Room at the Capitol in Olympia, Ferguson described the events as “un-American” and “outrageous in the extreme.”

""ICE is, to be blunt, completely and totally out of control,"" Ferguson said.

The controversy stems from the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, and Renee Good, also 37, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis in January.

These incidents have sparked national outrage and protests, including in Washington.

""We are focused on preparing, to the fullest extent possible, for a similar escalation by ICE, against our will, here in Washington state,"" the governor stated during the conference.

Ferguson further emphasized the need for political and community preparedness against potential escalations by ICE in Washington state.

""I cannot stop ICE from being in our state,"" he said. ""But we are not passive bystanders. We are prepared to use every tool at our disposal to mitigate against the harm inflicted by ICE,"" said Ferguson, ""And if ICE escalates their presence in our state, we will need even more Washingtonians to step up and help.""

Attorney General Nick Brown said public reporting is essential and pointed to the counter-narrative after the fatal shooting death of Pretti. The Department of Homeland Security said border agents acted in self-defense, but conflicting accounts from eyewitnesses, video evidence, and local politicians have called that narrative into question.

""My concern is an individual might hear this rhetoric from the governor and decide to physically confront a federal law enforcement agent in the midst of executing an immigration warrant, and that's when people get shot,"" said Republican State Rep. and WAGOP Chair Jim Walsh.

He called the Monday news conference 'troubling' concerning the governor's comments on immigration. ""And some of these tracks back to his social media posts of the last few days, where he was encouraging people to get active and not sit there, and calling authoritarian drift in our public policy. This is inflammatory language,"" Walsh said.

He also challenged the Governor and Attorney General, calling out what they describe as an unconstitutional memo from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that directs ICE agents to use force to enter homes without judicial warrants.

""They've always been able to operate with an admit what's called an administrative warrant. Now you can argue on the fine points of law here, but that is not a new thing,"" said the GOP Chair.

In the joint news conference, Ferguson went on to outline five steps the government is taking to counter federal immigration enforcement:

Criticizing the internal memo instruction ICE agents to enter homes without a warrant, Ferguson said he and AG Brown sent a letter to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem outlining how that memo is unconstitutional. The letter states that if ICE attempts any such unconstitutional actions in Washington, the state government would use every legal option available to fight the federal government.

The Chief of the Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will begin attending Ferguson's cabinet meetings to optimize responding to threats against immigrants. And the recent hiring of a senior advisor to work specifically on immigrant and refugee policy issues.

Mentioning Minnesota Gov. Walz's deployment of the National Guard in response to the killing of Pretti, Ferguson said he will take ""whatever steps are necessary"" to keep Washingtonians safe.

State and local partners are having ongoing conversations to coordinate tools and response plans.

Ferguson has asked that Senate Bill 5855, which would restrict when law enforcement officers can cover their faces while interacting with the public, be expedited in the legislature.

Ferguson also said he, Brown, and the state government would also legally push to hold individual ICE agents accountable.

Senate Bill 5855 would prohibit local, state, and federal officers — including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — from wearing masks that obscure their identities, with limited exceptions for undercover work and certain tactical operations. Supporters argue the measure is needed to ensure accountability and public trust, particularly following reports of masked immigration enforcement actions, while opponents argue it would endanger law enforcement officers.

McGovern (D-MA), Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee and top Democrat on the bipartisan Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, released the following statement encouraging global human rights leaders to continue forcefully speaking out about the death of Alex Pretti at the hands of U.S. government agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota:

“This weekend in Minneapolis, the United States government shot and killed Alex Pretti—an ICU nurse with no prior criminal history who was observing and documenting an interaction between federal officers and local residents. His last act was taking care of a woman who had been pushed to the ground by federal agents. Alarmingly, the agents who shot Mr. Pretti have not been put on leave, and it is unclear whether a thorough and transparent investigation will take place—signaling that federal officers would be acting with impunity, and denying Mr. Pretti’s family access to justice or appropriate reparations.

“To be clear, Mr. Pretti was legally and peacefully exercising both his First and Second Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. He was working to promote and protect human rights while taking actions that are specifically protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—the latter of which is the Supreme Law of the Land under Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution.

“As Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, named in honor of the only Holocaust survivor to ever serve in Congress, I call on governments and human rights leaders around the world to continue speaking out and sounding the alarm about what is going on in the United States. I call upon all relevant UN bodies, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and global human rights organizations and defenders to forcefully condemn Mr. Pretti's death and demand an immediate and impartial investigation.

Here are some takeaways from the hearing: Minnesota officials pushed for immediate action.
The state has not sought an end to all immigration enforcement in Minnesota, only a return to the levels seen before the surge.
Mr. Mayers, the federal government’s lawyer, argued that immigration agents were “here enforcing federal law” and were acting within their authority.
Judge Menendez noted that the state of Minnesota “has one set of values” around immigration enforcement, and the Trump administration has another.","A federal judge in Minnesota asked a lawyer for the Trump administration on Monday whether the surge of federal officers to the state was really just about immigration enforcement, or whether it might also be motivated by political retribution and coercion.

But the judge, Kate M. Menendez of the Federal District Court, also had pointed questions about the state government’s request that she issue a sweeping order blocking the surge of agents.

Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, filed a lawsuit two weeks ago claiming that the Trump administration’s campaign, called Operation Metro Surge, violates state sovereignty under the 10th Amendment and should be blocked. The surge has brought some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, resulting in thousands of arrests, three shootings and tense protests.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the bench by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., did not rule from the bench on Monday and did not provide a timeline for issuing a written decision. She indicated that she would move quickly.

“If I had a burner in front of the front burner, this would be on it,” the judge said as the hearing ended.

Here are some takeaways from the hearing:

Minnesota officials pushed for immediate action.

For two weeks, lawyers for the state and the cities have pressed Judge Menendez to immediately issue a temporary restraining order blocking the surge. But the judge has moved more slowly, giving the Trump administration time to reply to the lawsuit in writing, and then scheduling oral arguments.

Since her first hearing on the case, federal agents have shot two people in Minneapolis, including the nonfatal shooting of a Venezuelan man accused of resisting arrest and the killing on Saturday of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen and nurse. An earlier fatal shooting, of Renee Good, also a U.S. citizen, took place days before the suit was filed.

Lindsey Middlecamp, a lawyer for the state, reiterated the call for swift action on Monday, asking the judge to stop what she called an “invasion” of federal agents. She called on the judge to “issue a temporary restraining order today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Today.”

Sara Lathrop, a lawyer for the city of Minneapolis, said on Monday that the events over the weekend showed that the “situation is absolutely untenable.”

But Brantley Mayers, a lawyer for the Trump administration, described the request for an order blocking the surge as “a pretty staggering remedy.”

Judge Menendez asked where the line should be.

Judge Menendez said in court that “I think it goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times.” But she pressed lawyers for the state to explain when, in its view, the federal government deploying federal agents to enforce federal law could become a constitutional affront.

“How do I decide when a law enforcement response crosses the line from a legitimate law enforcement response to a response that violates the 10th Amendment?” the judge asked.

The state has not sought an end to all immigration enforcement in Minnesota, only a return to the levels seen before the surge. But its lawyers were reluctant to provide a specific number of agents or amount of enforcement that they believed tipped the scales into unconstitutional behavior.

“This is so far beyond the pale of legality,” said one of the state’s lawyers, Brian Carter.

The judge also expressed some concern about the sweeping nature of the lawsuit, and asked whether some of the claims of unconstitutional behavior might be better addressed through separate, more focused lawsuits, like one she is hearing on agents’ actions toward protesters.

“It seems that part of the solution for this set of wrongs that you describe is to bring cases about those wrongs,” Judge Menendez said, “rather than to say all of these things together means the federal government has to leave the state of Minnesota.”

The Trump administration defended the surge.

Mr. Mayers, the federal government’s lawyer, argued that immigration agents were “here enforcing federal law” and were acting within their authority.

He noted that Congress had passed immigration laws and that President Trump had campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration. Judge Menendez said that might be true broadly, but that the surge of thousands of “troops to the state of Minnesota has not been vetted in any democratic forge, so to speak.”

Mr. Mayers said the administration had found that Minnesota officials were not doing enough to help with immigration enforcement, and that more federal enforcement was needed “to address the law enforcement vacuum.”

Mr. Mayers argued that was not allowable for a state “to use the 10th Amendment as both a sword and a shield.” His point was that Minnesota officials were choosing not to cooperate with aspects of federal immigration enforcement, and then also objecting when the federal government decided to devote more resources to that issue in the state.

Judge Menendez noted that the state of Minnesota “has one set of values” around immigration enforcement, and the Trump administration has another. She told a lawyer for the state that “we’re at risk of asking me to decide who’s right there.”

The judge asked about possible ulterior motives.

State and city officials claimed that the motives for Operation Metro Surge reached beyond immigration enforcement and were part of a broader campaign of payback against the president’s perceived political enemies.

Mr. Carter said that “it is personal animosity, it is retribution” that was motivating the Trump administration’s campaign in Minnesota. He also accused the administration of trying to strong-arm the state into changing its policies on immigration.

“The federal government is attempting to bend the state’s will to its own,” Mr. Carter said, “and that is not allowed under the Constitution.”

Judge Menendez referred to a social media post by President Trump that mentioned Minnesota and said “THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” She also asked repeatedly about a letter sent over the weekend by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Gov. Tim Walz that outlined several policy demands for the state related to immigration enforcement, welfare programs and a request to hand over voter rolls.

Ms. Middlecamp, a lawyer for the state, had referred to Ms. Bondi’s letter as “a ransom note.”

Pressed on those issues, Mr. Mayers, the federal government’s lawyer, insisted the operation was about enforcing immigration laws.

“There is nothing to back up this claim that we’re here for another reason,” he said.

There is limited precedent.

While other states have brought 10th Amendment lawsuits against the federal government over the years, lawyers for both sides struggled to find direct parallels for the claims being made in this case.

Mr. Carter said that “this situation is unprecedented in the 250-year history of our country.” He claimed the deployment of immigration agents — which he called “essentially an army” — was intended to “basically stir the pot with conduct that is pervasive and includes widespread illegal violent conduct.”

Mr. Mayers countered that it was well within the president’s rights to deploy federal law enforcement agents within the country as he saw fit.

Fred Smith Jr., a Stanford law professor, said in an interview that Minnesota’s lawsuit “makes novel claims,” but that the “central government is doing novel things, and so there’s not a lot of precedent.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26minneapolis-ice-gun-fplk/26minneapolis-ice-gun-fplk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 19:57:51.296906

This is essentially asking a federal judge to sift into different buckets that which is federal power and that which is state power.
And I can say there’s not a lot of case law on this issue.
In the 10th Amendment argument, one of the arguments that Minnesota has made is the equal sovereignty principle.","A federal judge heard arguments on Jan. 26, 2026, as the state of Minnesota sought a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operation in the state. The administration has sent some 3,000 immigration agents to Minnesota, and attorneys for the state have argued, in part, that it amounts to an unconstitutional occupation, on 10th Amendment grounds. Alfonso Serrano, a politics editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Andrea Katz, a law scholar at Washington University in St. Louis, about the Minnesota lawsuit and its possible legal implications.

What’s the legal issue at stake in this court case?

In Minnesota v. Noem, attorneys for the state are arguing that the federal government is acting illegally by intruding on a sphere of state power (the police power). They’re claiming violations of the 10th Amendment, which is this idea that under the U.S. Constitution, states are reserved powers that existed before the Constitution was drafted, powers that are not delegated to the federal government.

They’re also making this rather new claim under what’s called the equal sovereignty principle, which is that states all have to be treated equally by the federal government. There’s also a First Amendment claim, and an Administrative Procedure Act claim, which is that the government is acting illegally in an arbitrary and capricious way. I think the 10th Amendment arguments are ones that I would say are kind of unprecedented, rather untested waters.

On that note, when does a federal law enforcement response cross the line and violate the 10th Amendment? Is there precedent for this?

The question you just posed is one that the district judge, Kate M. Menendez, seems to be nervous about having to hear. This is essentially asking a federal judge to sift into different buckets that which is federal power and that which is state power. And I can say there’s not a lot of case law on this issue.

The most filled-out doctrine under the 10th Amendment is the anti-commandeering doctrine. It holds that the federal government cannot use the state government as a sort of puppet. The federal government can’t use state officers forcibly against the state’s will to enforce the law. Now that is not, strictly speaking, what’s going on here, because Minnesota is complaining about the presence of federal agents enforcing the laws in ways that it thinks are illegal.

And so it seems to me that the 10th Amendment has been most developed in this area that Minnesota is not touching on, and so for that reason, I think their invocation of it is pretty unusual. They’re essentially claiming that the 10th Amendment protects their police powers and that the federal government is intruding on that. I think that’s a novel argument in court, and my suspicion is that it is not likely to be a winning argument in court.

The Trump administration has dismissed the state’s legal theory, saying the president is acting within his authority, correct?

Yeah, I think that’s correct. Again, I want to make clear that Minnesota has made many arguments against the Trump administration, and I’m just focusing on the merits of this 10th Amendment argument.

There was a sort of undeveloped strand of cases in the mid-20th century where the Supreme Court tried to develop this idea of core state powers. And so it said the federal government couldn’t act in a way that violated a state’s core powers, like where to put your state capital, or control over natural resources, or defining salaries for state government employees. The court said these are core state powers.

But then in a famous case called Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, in 1985, the court overruled itself and said – and this is still where we are – federal courts cannot be in the business of defining what constitutes a core state power. It’s too open-ended, undefined. It’s a political inquiry. It’s not something that’s appropriate for a judge.

And so I think on this 10th Amendment argument, Minnesota is essentially asking the courts to revive this core state powers doctrine, which I think the court is unlikely to do.

What repercussions could the judge’s ruling have?

Minnesota has already filed, in a case called Tincher v. Noem, a more conventional set of claims, which is that ICE agents broke the law, are violating rights, acting in excess of their authority. They have already gotten preliminary relief on this first set of claims, although Judge Menendez’s order is now on hold, pending appeal before the 8th Circuit court.

That is different from this 10th Amendment claim. In the 10th Amendment argument, one of the arguments that Minnesota has made is the equal sovereignty principle. The equal sovereignty principle was articulated in the 2013 case, Shelby County v. Holder. This is the famous case where the Supreme Court struck down an important part of the Voting Rights Act that prevented Southern states from restricting the vote, apparently on the basis of race. In Shelby County, the court said that the Voting Rights Act, which subjected certain states with a pattern of racial discrimination on the vote to a preclearance process where the federal government had to approve their laws before they passed them, treated different states differently.

Of course, in that case, the federal government said those are states that have a history of discrimination, so the federal government was justified in treating them differently.

But Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the Shelby County opinion, said the 10th Amendment means that the government can’t treat different states differently.

Now it’s not a well-regarded doctrine, so it’s kind of shocking that Minnesota is invoking it here. For one reason, the equal sovereignty principle has not been well developed since Shelby County. The second reason it would be a big deal – quite shocking to me, if the judge enforced it – is that Shelby County was talking about legislation that treated different states differently.

If we pass a rule where the executive branch can’t treat different states differently, you’re essentially denying the existence of discretion in enforcement, which is very quintessentially an executive power, right?

It could, for example, lead to states saying that federal agents can’t come in to help people in a natural disaster. So again, I think this argument, like the rest of the 10th Amendment arguments, suffers from being undeveloped in the case law and potentially carrying a risk of kneecapping the federal government’s ability to enforce the law, which sometimes does, for totally good-faith reasons, require treating different states differently.

Any final thoughts?

The first Trump administration was highly disorganized and didn’t take concerted action for a while. The second Trump administration was the precise opposite of that. They acted quickly and in a very organized fashion, pushing power as far as it can go in a number of agencies.

And I think the question this gets back to is how the federal courts have reacted to this barrage of executive orders, of new applications of old laws, of new forms of government power exercised in a way that threatens federalism.

The federal courts usually grant deference to the president when the government issues statements in the context of litigation. Court doctrine is to defer to those statements as being entitled. It’s a presumption of regularity, of accuracy. And I think we’re already seeing in the district courts some suspicion by the judges of the government’s version of things.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/714482/original/file-20260126-56-x6kals.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C250%2C3000%2C1500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-26 18:58:30.753466

Frey said he asked Trump in a phone call to end the immigration enforcement surge and that Trump agreed the present situation cannot continue.

Frey said while some agents will begin leaving Tuesday, he will keep pushing for others involved in Operation Metro Surge to go.

Trump posted on social media that he had a good conversation with Frey. ""Lots of progress is being made!"" he wrote.

Among the agents who are expected to depart was senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.

Bovino has been at the centre of the administration's aggressive enforcement surge in cities nationwide. His departure marks a significant public shift in federal law enforcement posture amid mounting outrage over the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents.

Earlier in the day, Trump said he ordered his border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee the immigration crackdown there.

Bovino's leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.

Criticism has increased around Bovino in the last few days after his public defence of the Pretti shooting and disputed claims about the confrontation that led to his death.

Trump speaks to the governor

Trump and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz also spoke by phone earlier Monday and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they have exchanged in the past, with Trump declaring in a social media post that he is now on a ""similar wavelength"" as the governor.

Walz, in a statement, said the call was ""productive"" and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for ""any and all"" criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honours federal requests for people in its custody.

The two conversations came the same day a federal judge heard arguments in a lawsuit aimed at halting the federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

Attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul appeared Monday before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant requests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.

She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Judge Menendez questioned the government's motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

""I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?"" Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Video contradicts Trump administration accounts of shooting

The president's decision to send Tom Homan to Minneapolis came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Bovino led contentious news conferences over the weekend about the fatal shooting on Saturday of Alex Pretti.

Both officials defended the actions of Border Patrol agents almost immediately, instead of waiting for an investigation to play out.

Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired ""defensively"" against Pretti as he ""approached"" them with a gun. While Pretti was armed, he was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, and may have been properly following state laws on carrying weapons.

Pretti appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos of the moments before his killing.

3 investigations underway

Asked during a briefing Monday if Noem had made a mistake that led Trump to send Homan to Minnesota, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said no.

She said that Homan ""is in a unique position to drop everything and go to Minnesota to continue having these productive conversations with state and local officials."" Homan would be ""catching a plane in just a few hours to do just that, at the at the request of the president,"" Leavitt said.

The Press Secretary said the shooting and killing of Pretti ""occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.""

The White House continues to say that resistance to Trump's agenda is what led to the shootings and killings of Pretti and Renee Good after ICE agents have engaged in aggressive operations in Minnesota.

Both Pretti and Renee Good, fatally shot on Jan. 7, were bystanders who were not targets of federal operations.

Leavitt said that a trio of ""active investigations"" and internal probes of the shooting were underway by federal agencies. Leavitt said that the Department of Homeland Security and FBI were investigating the shooting and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was ""conducting their own internal review.""

State, cities update suit against DHS

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request in an effort to restore the order that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota on Dec. 1.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to the Pretti shooting.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul, Minn.

The unrest, largely in Minneapolis-St. Paul, could have political ramifications that affect Americans outside of the state. Democratic anger over the tactics of the immigration blitz have led many of the party's senators to oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, a stand that increases the prospect of a partial government shutdown by the end of the week.

Six of the 12 annual spending bills for the current budget year have been signed into law by the president. Six more are awaiting action in the Senate, and if senators fail to act by midnight Friday, funding for Homeland Security and the other agencies covered under the six bills will lapse.

Trump and Democratic

Gov. Tim Walz spoke in a phone call and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they have exchanged in the past. Their conversation happened on the same day a federal judge heard arguments in a lawsuit aimed at halting the federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

“We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president wrote in a social media post.

Walz, in a statement, said the call was “productive” and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for “any and all” criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honors federal requests for people in its custody.

It was unclear whether the new tone would lead to changes. Attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul appeared Monday before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant requests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.

She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued the situation on the street is so dire it requires the court to halt the federal government’s enforcement actions.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

The judge questioned the government’s motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

“I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?” Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Brantley Mayers, a Justice Department attorney, said the government’s goal is to enforce federal law. Mayers said one lawful action should not be used to discredit another lawful action.

“I don’t see how the fact that we’re also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge,” Mayers said.

Menendez questioned where the line was between violating the Constitution and the executive’s power to enforce the law. She also asked whether she was being asked to decide between state and federal policies.

“That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,” she said.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

“I can’t be the global keeper of all things here. Like, presumably that will be litigated,” she said to the state’s attorney.

Menendez made it clear that she was struggling with how to rule because the case is so unusual, and there are few precedents.

“It’s because this is important that I’m doing everything I can to get it right,” she said.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday added urgency to the case.

Border czar to Minnesota

In other developments, Trump said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. The president’s statement came after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the public face of the crackdown, answered questions at news conferences over the weekend about Pretti’s shooting. Trump posted on social media that Homan will report directly to him.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan would be “the main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis” during continued operations by federal immigration officers.

In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Other state implications

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

“If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,” the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday’s shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti’s killing.

The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday’s shooting. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

Hotel where federal agents believed to be was targeted

On Sunday night, protesters targeted a Minneapolis hotel where federal agents were believed to be staying, blocking a major avenue on the edge of the University of Minnesota campus.

A freelance photographer working for The Associated Press saw smashed glass in the hotel lobby, as well as graffiti with obscenities and threats directed at ICE.

A Minneapolis police officer was inside the hotel and tried to provide aid to a federal agent who was injured. More officers from local and state agencies planned to move in to “deescalate the situation, and make arrests,” Minneapolis police said Monday in a statement.

But as they began to reach the scene and arrested two people, federal agents arrived and “deployed chemical munitions,” the police statement said. A DHS spokesperson said a statement on the situation would be provided later Monday.

At a Minneapolis hearing on their request to temporarily suspend the deployment of several thousand additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to the state, Minnesota attorneys called the federal escalation “unprecedented” and destructive.

They called for an immediate ruling from U.S. District Judge Katherine M. Menendez to prevent any further harm to the state.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” said Assistant Minnesota Attorney General Brian Carter.

“What we have is a federal operation that is designed to cause havoc, that is designed to cause the local governments to experience pain, that is designed to cause the state of Minnesota to have to expend its resources,” he later argued, calling use of force in Minneapolis “jaw-dropping.”

Monday’s hearing comes after the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents of an anti-ICE protester in Minnesota since the beginning of “Operation Metro Surge” last month. On Saturday, immigration agents shot to death 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. On Jan. 7, an agent fatally shot Renee Good, 37.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and city attorneys have argued the crackdown is not just leading to deaths and civil rights violations, but harm to public safety, health and education in the state, as well as its businesses. They noted reports of random detainments based on racial profiling.

Administration lawyers cite lack of local cooperation

Attorneys representing the Trump administration argued the purpose of the operation, which has brought roughly 4,000 immigration enforcement agents to the state, is a response to a lack of cooperation from local officials.

They claim that the state and counties have failed to turn over people in custody for crimes who are in the U.S. illegally — something the state Department of Corrections denies. ICE has claimed there are more than 1,300 people with immigration arrest detainers in Minnesota custody. The DOC counted just 94 in the state’s county jails.

“We are here because of this law enforcement vacuum,” Justice Department attorney Brantley Mayers told Menendez when questioned about the purpose of the crackdown. Attorneys representing the federal government have characterized the state and local challenges as an attempt to thwart law enforcement and impede their federal duties.

Letter from Pam Bondi

Lawyers for the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office said a Saturday letter from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding the state comply with immigration enforcement and turn over welfare and immigration data shows that a central purpose of “Operation Metro Surge” is coercion.

“Attorney General Pam Bondi sent what can only be described as a ransom note setting out the terms on which the federal government is holding Minnesota’s public safety, public health and public education hostage,” said Lindsey Middlecamp, an attorney with Ellison’s office.

Federal access to voter and welfare data are both subject to ongoing litigation, and attorneys with the state argued the Trump administration was using its power to gain concessions from the state when it had failed to do so through legal channels.

Menendez said that although the country is in “shockingly unusual times,” she was wary of wading into what could be seen as an immigration policy disagreement between state and federal authorities, noting that the unprecedented nature of the situation did not necessarily mean she could “craft a remedy.”

She also questioned whether it was her role to control all aspects of the dispute over federal immigration action in Minneapolis with numerous lawsuits seeking to challenge various aspects of the enforcement surge.

Judge did not say when she would rule

Earlier this month, Menendez ruled that federal agents couldn’t detain peaceful protesters or use tear gas on them, though that ruling was later suspended by an appeals court.

The matter before the court on Monday was not the lawsuit itself, but a decision on whether immigration operations should be suspended pending a final decision on the case.

Menendez, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2021, did not say when she would rule, but said the matter was a high priority.

The popular backlash against ICE over killing Pretti extends well beyond Reddit and other social media platforms.
But the horror of what is happening makes it harder to compartmentalize elsewhere on the platform, this r/Minneapolis moderator thinks, leading to more people in other subreddits posting about ICE.","On Saturday morning, a Reddit user who has posted about living in Minneapolis for years shared a video on the city’s subreddit, r/Minneapolis, with the title “Another ICE murder in front of Glam Doll Donuts.”

The 40-second clip showed a group of federal agents tackling 37-year-old Alex Pretti to the ground and beating him. About 20 seconds in, one of them begins shooting Pretti. At least 10 gunshots go off, from multiple agents, and a person can be heard yelling “Did they fucking kill that guy? Are you fucking kidding me dude? Not again.” (The agents who fired on Pretti have not been charged, nor has ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good on January 7. They have been moved to “other locations,” according to CBP official Greg Bovino.)

The video was upvoted more than 60,000 times, reaching the top of Reddit’s homepage.

Over the past month, as the Department of Homeland Security has deployed thousands of armed, masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Minnesota’s Twin Cities, the r/Minneapolis subreddit has become a vital news and information hub for both residents and outsiders.

Previously, the user who shared the shooting footage posted about a missing dog poster and about trees being cut down near a local lake. “I just wanted a local subreddit to know what was happening in my city, and now all of a sudden, we’ve turned into this de facto hub of information for basically how to fight fascism,” says one r/Minneapolis moderator, who has been in the volunteer position for close to a decade and spoke on the condition of anonymity due to safety concerns.

For many of the longtime r/Minneapolis users, ICE agents have occupied their backyards. But even outside of the local Minnesota subreddits, rage against ICE has reached a boiling point. A majority of posts in r/all, where top posts across all subreddits are ranked, was devoted Saturday and Sunday to mocking and criticizing ICE for killing Pretti.

In the Reddit community for cross stitching, the top post this weekend was a “Fuck Ice” embroidery, and there were multiple variations of the same slogan in the stained glass subreddit, too. “FUCK ICE” was painted on an acrylic set in a nail polish subreddit, where other users offered dupes to get the look of a woman’s bright pink nails in a picture where her hand was pressed against a prominent right-wing influencer’s face during a downtown Minneapolis clash.

When the moderator of camera subreddit r/Leica prohibited “partisan comments” on photos of ICE officers in Minneapolis, a user wrote “HATE the censorship of this sub.” (Photojournalist John Abernathy—who went viral after tossing his camera to another photographer while being tackled by ICE agents.) Even users in r/massivecock, where most of the posts are images of erect penises, railed against ICE in their captions.

“I think it’s just like this awareness of the level of injustice taking place,” said the r/Minneapolis moderator, adding that people outside the state are increasingly worried about being targeted by ICE. “They’re testing things here. They’re coming for you next.”

Americans have become significantly more in favor of abolishing ICE since Donald Trump’s second administration began unprecedented raids of blue cities.

Before the 2024 election, polling showed only around 1 in 4 people surveyed supported abolishing ICE—now, the same polls show 43 percent support it. Anger has peaked over ICE’s brutal occupation of Minneapolis, especially after officer Ross killed 37-year-old Good. After agents killed Pretti, even people who rarely share positive sentiments about Minneapolis, like fans of competing football teams in Minnesota, Chicago, Detroit, and Green Bay, are increasingly protesting ICE in their shared subreddit. “The ruling on the field is that this is a meme football sub,” said one of the top posts this weekend in r/NFCNorthMemeWar. “HOWEVER … FUCK ICE and fuck any bootlicker who supports them.”

Even the moderator of r/catbongos, a subreddit for playfully patting your cat like you’re playing the bongos, posted an anti-ICE screed—and it quickly became the subreddit’s most-upvoted post ever. “The nice thing about owning a subreddit is I can use it as my personal soapbox, so after the blatant murder by ICE today in Minnesota, I wanted to say something,” the post, titled “If you still support Trump/ICE even slightly, you're not welcome in this sub,” began. “We are reaching a point where we can no longer tolerate the people who are supporting or making excuses for this, or have them be a part of our lives.” Many of the top replies to the post said they were joining r/catbongos because of it.

The popular backlash against ICE over killing Pretti extends well beyond Reddit and other social media platforms. Even Republican House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer suggested that Trump should pull ICE out of Minneapolis, while Fox News host Maria Bartiromo said there was no evidence Pretti was threatening law enforcement, and a guest on the channel said that the White House misrepresented the facts of the shooting. Plus, since Pretti was carrying a concealed gun, the National Rifle Association and other gun advocacy groups that are usually pro-Trump have called for a full investigation—while the subreddit for concealed-carry weapons lambasted Trump’s posts about Pretti’s setup.

The longtime r/Minneapolis moderator is reminded of what happened after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd roughly 17 blocks away from where Pretti was shot, inspiring the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement. Both times, the subreddit became a front line for news, on-the-ground footage, community resources, and supporters from around the world. She and her fellow moderators work “easily 20 hours a week,” unpaid, to keep up at peak times. They respond to reports and messages, weed out duplicate posts of the same videos, and guard the subreddit from agitators and trolls.

“We’re filtering the comments, we’re banning problematic users before they can really spread out and go into multiple threads and harass multiple people,” the moderator says. “You are literally dealing with the worst types of people ... They’re trying to misrepresent what happened or just straight up make fun of them. They find it funny.”

Another r/Minneapolis moderator who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity started volunteering around a month ago, as activity on the subreddit was ramping up. He has had to force himself to take a break after spending hours staring at screenshots of the moment when Pretti was shot. To prevent users from seeing something graphic they may not want to, the moderators require these posts to have a NSFW (not safe for work) or “spoiler” filter. But the horror of what is happening makes it harder to compartmentalize elsewhere on the platform, this r/Minneapolis moderator thinks, leading to more people in other subreddits posting about ICE.

“Logically you’re like ‘Yeah, of course, people wouldn’t post political stuff there,’ but the people who are moderating and using these communities are people and they’re still seeing that content in other places and they’re still wrestling with the moral questions of this time,” he says. “And if that means they’re going to do it in ‘catbongos’ or some ‘not safe for work’ sub, that’s where they’re going to do it.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/6977407f4869b26615030c5f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/012626_Reddit_ICE.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 18:58:22.095643

Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill last fall, demanding that the GOP include an extension to expiring Obamacare tax credits.","WASHINGTON — Most of the federal government could shut down at the end of the week. But that likely wouldn’t halt aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol operations in Minneapolis and other parts of the country.

Democrats are up in arms after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis over the weekend. That came after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, another Minneapolis resident and citizen, in her car earlier this month.

Under enormous pressure from the base, Senate Democrats have vowed to block a sweeping government funding bill unless significant restrictions are imposed on the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

With Republicans plowing ahead with a vote on the House-passed $1.2 trillion funding package later this week, a partial shutdown beginning Saturday now seems increasingly likely. Money is set to run out for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, and many other critical agencies late Friday night.

Yet, even if Democrats shut down the government, ICE operations aren't likely to be hindered in any meaningful way. Under DHS' shutdown plan, a GOP leadership source said, ICE employees would be considered ""excepted"" workers and required to continue showing up to work, though they, like other workers, would not get paid.

On top of that, even in a shutdown, ICE would continue to have ample funding since the agency received $75 billion of additional money for detention and enforcement from President Donald Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" last year, the GOP source noted.

The source also argued that if DHS is funded through yet another stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution or ""CR,"" it would have more flexibility to move money around within the agency to support ICE operations than it would under the massive funding bill at issue.

Even though she voted against the DHS funding bill in the House, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, which wrote the funding bill, made many of those same arguments upon unveiling the bipartisan legislation last week.

""ICE received $75 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In the event of a lapse in funding, ICE would be able to sustain regular operations for multiple years, while the other agencies under this bill would likely be forced to furlough workers and reduce operations,"" DeLauro's office explained.

""A continuing resolution would extend funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations at their current level, instead of reducing it by $115 million, and would exclude new guardrails contained in this full-year funding measure,"" her office said.

While DeLauro noted the negotiated funding deal did not include broad reforms to ICE, it would keep ICE funding flat for the remainder of the fiscal year, which runs until Oct. 1. It also would reduce the number of ICE detention beds by 5,500 and include $20 million for body cameras for ICE agents. (DHS is reviewing footage from multiple body-worn cameras in Pretti's killing, sources told NBC News on Monday.)

Congress has already passed, and Trump has signed into law, six out of the 12 full-year appropriations bills, meaning that some agencies are funded through Sept. 30. That includes funding for the departments of Justice, Commerce, Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs, as well as the legislative branch. The Smithsonian museums and national parks would remain open since they get their funding through Interior appropriations. SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, also would not be affected by a shutdown.

But the other six appropriations bills not yet passed by Congress account for $1.2 trillion in federal spending, or nearly 80% of the total amount Congress plans to appropriate for the 2026 fiscal year. The majority of that funding is for the Defense Department ($831 billion).

Because the House packaged those six remaining funding bills together and sent them to the Senate, a shutdown would affect many important agencies.

In addition to the Pentagon and DHS, they include the departments of State, Treasury, Transportation, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development.

Shutting down DHS — one of the most sprawling agencies in the government — would mean that Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration and Coast Guard employees would not be paid, even as they'd be required to work.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday that Democrats are willing to pass the five other appropriations bills if they are separated from the DHS funding bill. But Republicans see no incentive to go that route, believing Democrats will be blamed for voting down a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that was already agreed to by Democratic negotiators.

If the government funding lapses at the end of the week, it would mark the second federal shutdown in four months during Trump's second term in office. Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill last fall, demanding that the GOP include an extension to expiring Obamacare tax credits.

That shut the government down for 43 days — the longest shutdown in U.S. history.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260126-federal-agents-minneapolis-ew-1229p-d21bd0.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 18:57:58.706563

Texas Democrats condemn the shooting

In his first public comments on ICE since Saturday's shooting, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said his administration is ""handling that immigration issue as responsible as humanly possible [sic],"" saying other major American cities are ""in turmoil.""

""Start naming the major cities in America, they're all in turmoil, they're out on the street,"" Whitmire said on Hello Houston. ""And there's a tragedy in Minneapolis, I understand that. But for Houston to start throwing things and words at them would just draw attention to us that we don't want.""

State Rep. Gina Hinojosa, D-Austin, who is running for governor, condemned the shooting and ICE's operation in Minneapolis entirely in a statement on X on Saturday.

""Another American has been shot and killed in the street by ICE in MN,"" she wrote in a statement. ""Children are being torn from their homes and sent to taxpayer-funded private prisons in TX run by Abbott's donors. They use cruelty to mask the corruption and no one is safe. This inhumanity has to stop.""

U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and State Rep. James Talarico, who are both seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, spoke about the ICE operations in a debate on Saturday, hours after the shooting.

Crockett highlighted her vote against funding the federal agency and her support for impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

""There was no way I was going to continue to pump a historic amount of money into this rogue organization,"" Crockett said, referring to ICE, ""that is going out and is violating people's rights every single day on American cities. I was just not going to do it at the end of the day. Right now, I think that we need to clean house from top to bottom.""

Talarico likewise said he supported impeaching Noem as well as holding individual ICE agents responsible for any violations of the law. When pressed, he came closer to saying that he would vote to defund ICE.

""We need to prosecute agents who have abused their power. We have to haul these masked men before Congress so the world can see their faces,"" Talarico said. ""We have seen this historic increase in funding for ICE. That money has come out of our health care. So, what I would say is that we should take that money back and put it in our communities where it belongs.""

Thus far, eight members of Texas' House Democratic Caucus are backing a resolution calling for the impeachment of Noem, largely as a result of ICE's operations. Including Crockett, those members of Congress are Julie Johnson of Farmers Branch, Lloyd Doggett of Austin, Veronica Escobar of El Paso, Greg Casar of Austin, Al Green of Houston, Sylvia Garcia of Houston and Joaquin Castro of San Antonio.

Republicans blame Minnesota leadership

Early Monday morning, President Donald Trump announced he would send Tom Homan, the White House's Border Czar, to Minneapolis, who will report back to the president.

U.S. Sen. John Cornyn called that a ""great move,"" adding that, ""State & local officials in Minneapolis have failed to contain the chaos organized & funded by the radical left & I'm glad the Trump admin is committed to ending the lawlessness.""

Cornyn, who is facing a heated GOP primary to keep his seat in the Senate, criticized Crockett and Talarico's comments during the Senate debate as ""unhinged,"" specifically noting their criticisms of ICE. Cornyn also shared a post from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which said that Pretti had a firearm when he was killed. Cornyn added, ""Just a thought: Maybe the critics ought to wait for the facts before jumping to a conclusion. Reflexive anti-police rhetoric is dangerous.""

Analysts, including from the Washington Post, noted that agents had taken Pretti's gun away from him before shooting and killing him.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, one of Cornyn's primary challengers, also criticized Crockett and Talarico. He shared a post from Dan Scavino, White House Deputy Chief of Staff, that said, ""I stand with ICE.""

During a recording of his podcast, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he would largely hold off on weighing in on the shooting until the results of an investigation are shared. Though he called the shooting “tragic,” he blamed Minnesota's Democratic leaders for instigating demonstrators.

""The individual who was shot, he could have avoided that risk altogether,"" Cruz said. ""Number one, he could have chosen not to go to the protest, that's one choice. You might say, ‘Well, he feels passionately that he disagrees with what ICE is doing and he wants to exercise his First Amendment rights.' OK, those are protected; he has that right. Secondly, he could have chosen to go there and not bring a firearm.""

Other prominent Republican members of Congress from Texas, including Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Troy Nehls, have largely kept away from weighing in.

January 26, 2026, Washington, D.C. – Over the weekend, immigration enforcement agents killed another U.S. citizen, 37-year-old Alex Pretti. This is just weeks after the murder of Renee Good, and dozens of other violent actions that have harmed immigrants and U.S. citizens alike. The Senate will consider a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget this week that increases funding for immigration enforcement and will lead to more children and families being needlessly victimized. Members of Congress must reject any legislation that further empowers the administration to continue its attacks against families across the country.

Trump Administration officials have made clear since day one of their second term that they intended to go after children, families, and workers. Children are bearing the brunt of this hateful agenda. In just the first few weeks of this year, a five-year-old was used as bait after immigration enforcement agents followed him and his father home from school and arrested his father near their home; several children, including a six-month-old, were hospitalized after their car was tear-gassed on their way home; a 17-year-old was violently assaulted at work, abducted, and then thrown out in a parking lot miles away; and a seven-year-old and her parents were abducted in front of a hospital where they went to seek emergency care for her.

CLASP, along with other children’s advocates from the Children Thrive Action Network, have called on Congress to reject any increased funding for immigration enforcement that kidnaps entire families and traumatizes children. The devastating harms already inflicted on children and families across the country aren’t reversible, but additional harms are absolutely preventable. It is up to Congress to stand with communities and stop this administration’s crusade of violence.

Let us be clear. There is no acceptable amount of funding in this legislation for body cameras or oversight language that justifies increased or level funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The historic funding increases for these agencies included in H.R.1 have allowed the administration to rapidly onboard agents and turbocharge deportation efforts. The video recordings of these agents violently attacking and killing people and breaking the law make it abundantly clear that body cameras are doing little to deter agents from using violence, nor are they leading to meaningful consequences or changes to unlawful protocols. We have enacted laws, policies, and guidance that are supposed to prevent these abuses; yet the Trump Administration is actively disregarding them. Therefore, the Senate must not pass a budget that increases funding for ICE and CBP. Doing so would empower this administration to continue to terrorize our communities.

As an organization that’s been working for more than 50 years to advance policies that allow all children and families to thrive, we call on Congress and state and local officials to hold this administration accountable and protect our communities from further harm.",https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Minneapolis-protest-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 18:58:02.966291

A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.
Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress.","The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion dollar spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4875x2742+0+254/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb8%2F8c%2Fa04f6a8e42e88671da2b58b7eb0c%2Fgettyimages-2258308397.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:58:49.938699

Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.","Congressional Republicans showed signs of wavering on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the wake of another shooting of a US citizen in Minnesota.

While the weakening resolve was far from a full break with Trump, it signals growing unease with the administration’s aggressive actions as Democrats threaten another government shutdown and November’s midterm elections come into view. Until now, Republicans have backed Trump as he deploys federal agents and National Guard to US cities.

Hundreds of videos have shown the agents using pepper spray, shoving, punching and kicking protesters who have stayed largely peaceful and are recording the agents’ actions. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a nurse at a VA hospital, while he was subdued and on his knees after they discovered a gun he had a permit to carry.

“We’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

“I don’t like any shooting,” the president added. “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun.”

House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, suggested on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures that Trump should consider going “to another city and then maybe let the people of Minneapolis decide” how to proceed on immigration. He also defended immigration agents.

New York Republican Andrew Garbarino, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, has requested public testimony from top immigration officials, telling them in a letter Saturday that Congress “has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Other Republicans who have previously broken with Trump on other matters - including retiring Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Thomas Massie - were more frank.

“There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on X.

Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, also called in a post on X for an investigation “both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system.”

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said on CNN’s State of the Union that the agents involved in Pretti’s killing were “most likely” being placed on administrative leave and sent from Minneapolis.

Another Senate Republican, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also broke sharply from the White House’s messaging and demanded “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis “incredibly disturbing” and said the credibility of ICE and Homeland Security are at stake.

“We can trust the American people with the truth,” Cassidy said.

But silence from other leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, suggest that many in the party are still weighing how to respond to Pretti’s killing.

Shutdown Threat

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer vowed late Saturday to block a massive spending package next week unless Republicans strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security, dramatically increasing the risk for a partial US government shutdown.

Democratic opposition to the funding package potentially affects not just Homeland Security but also the departments of Defense, Labor, Education, State, Treasury and Health and Human Services.

None of the Republicans speaking on Sunday mentioned the looming shutdown fight.

The effects of another shutdown would be widespread, including possibly delaying the next Bureau of Labor Statistics report.

In the event of a shutdown, many essential workers - including the military and Transportation Security Administration agents - may have to work without pay. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol employees would likely be paid through additional funding in Trump’s tax bill signed last year.

The House passed the spending bill Thursday and left Washington until after the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.

With the White House calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and accusing him of impeding the work of Border Patrol, despite video evidence to the contrary, Senate Republican leaders will be under enormous pressure to protect DHS funding.

The spending legislation needs votes from at least seven Democrats to pass the Senate.

Several moderates in the party quickly announced Saturday they’d oppose the bill.

At least one other American, Renee Good, was killed by an ICE agent when he stopped her for partly blocking a street with her car, claiming she tried to run him over.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling -and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE.”

Forcing a shutdown risks hard-fought Democratic victories in the spending deal, including reversing many Trump cuts to medical research, foreign aid, education grants and mass transit.

The situation in Minnesota, however, has alienated key Democratic senators.

Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, each of whom voted to end the last shutdown, said in statements Saturday they would oppose funding for Homeland Security without changes. Rosen insisted she will oppose funding “until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said the resistance isn’t about his party or politics.

“It’s about our country and our Congress, and what we need to do to impose some safeguards on an out-of-control agency which is imbued with a culture of lawlessness and seems to be committing murder in Minneapolis,” Blumenthal said.

Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, called Pretti’s killing a “heartbreaking tragedy.”

“It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,” they said in a statement.

Delays Ahead

The Senate, a slow-moving legislative body, already faces potential delays from an expected snowstorm. The House’s planned absence next week complicates matters further ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

All but seven House Democrats voted against the DHS bill in the House, with many in the party seeking body camera requirements and other restraints on raids by ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Top Senate Democrat spending panel member Patty Murray said she won’t support the DHS bill as it stands, and it “needs to be split off from the larger funding package.”

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray said in a post on X. “I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

PAUL, Minn. — The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) issued this statement after the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.

“Executions in the streets. Abductions by masked security forces at gunpoint. Mass detention in an abusive and unaccountable system. Disinformation campaigns to justify it all.

“This is what a widespread assault on fundamental human rights looks like. It’s going to take a widespread human rights movement to stop it.

For a second time, the Administration has been quick to vilify the victim and defend the officer. For a second time this month, Americans can see with their own eyes ICE killing with impunity.

This is a public safety crisis instigated by an American president. If Republicans are afraid to take the lead and stand up to Trump’s abuse of power, Democrats will.

Trump’s ICE has demonstrated itself to be reckless, dangerous, and lawless towards Americans and immigrants alike. Democrats must condemn these abuses and advocate for immediate reforms, while also remembering who is to blame first: this is Donald Trump and Kristi Noem’s ICE. Most Americans want immigration laws enforced reasonably, responsibly, and humanely. But they do not want this.

To help Democrats to meet the gravity of this ever-evolving moment, this memo highlights: 1) the current public safety crisis, 2) key steps to immediately rein in its abuses, and 3) the major elements of what a humane interior enforcement strategy should look like. In short:

This is a public safety crisis.

ICE abuses must end.

ICE and CBP should be immediately withdrawn from Minnesota and pause at-large operations in urban areas until they prove they can conduct them safely.

Masks on federal law enforcement should be a rare exception, not the rule.

Trump must rein in his out-of-control ICE everywhere, end the chaos, restore professionalism, and hold bad actors accountable.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must be removed.

The weaponization of ICE by Trump to settle political scores and vendettas must stop.

ICE enforcement and deportations must be targeted at dangerous undocumented immigrants based on previous violent criminal activity.

A top-to-bottom reform of Trump’s ICE must commence at once.

ICE Has Caused a Public Safety Crisis

Trump’s ICE is off the rails. What Americans have seen since Donald Trump took office for a second time a year ago is not “targeted” immigration enforcement to get the “worst of the worst.” It is a national dragnet that is intentionally making our communities less safe.

Masked agents are roaming neighborhoods, refusing to identify themselves, and arresting people without explanation. They are smashing windows, dragging people from their cars, and detaining them without saying who they are or why they are doing it.

Local law enforcement is now regularly speaking out against ICE’s endangerment of local communities, including Hennepin County, Minnesota, Sheriff DaWanna Witt, who said, “We demand more from our federal government, more professionalism, more accountability, more humanity. We demand lawful policing that respects human dignity.”

The President and Republicans are floundering, scrambling to blame the recent chaos on so-called “sanctuary” policies that allow local law enforcement to make careful decisions about how and when they aid federal immigration enforcement. Overriding them would do nothing to restore order—it would simply be another example of Washington overreach into local law enforcement decisions on how best to maintain public safety.

What’s worse, the danger posed by this force has only grown more severe. The recent deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were carried out by experienced federal agents, not by the thousands of new ICE officers this Administration has rushed through recruitment and training in the last few months. With 12,000 of these new recruits now being pushed out into the field, the risk that even more unprepared officers will make deadly mistakes can’t be dismissed. If seasoned agents are already lethal in Minneapolis, imagine how much more dangerous this blanket enforcement will become as these rookies hit the streets.

Talking Points on ICE Abuses

Trump’s ICE is off the rails. This is not targeted enforcement against serious threats—it is a nationwide dragnet that is intentionally making American communities less safe.

We must immediately end the use of ICE as a political weapon and the abuse of federal law enforcement to settle Trump’s political and personal vendettas.

Masked federal agents operating without identification, explanation, or transparency are not restoring order—they are creating chaos.

Local law enforcement is sounding the alarm—and Washington should listen. Sheriffs and police chiefs across the country are warning ICE’s tactics are endangering their communities and undermining legitimate policing.

Blaming sanctuary policies for this chaos is a joke. What’s new isn’t sanctuary policies; it’s an Administration that has lost control and is now trying to scapegoat the people actually responsible for public safety.

This Administration didn’t inherit chaos—it created it, and now it’s trying to undermine local authorities to avoid accountability.

The danger is escalating—not receding. The killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were carried out by experienced federal agents—not new, untrained recruits.

Yet the Administration has rushed 12,000 newly hired officers through shortened training and lowered standards and is now deploying them into communities.

If seasoned agents are already using deadly force, it is reckless to pretend that flooding neighborhoods with less-prepared officers will make anyone safer.

People are being stopped, questioned, and taken away with no probable cause, no warrants, and—in too many cases—no explanation at all.

Some victims are released hours later with bruises and trauma. Others disappear into detention with no explanation.

Americans should not have to fear being stopped, grabbed, or harmed by their own government.

This is what it looks like when a government stops respecting the rule of law.

Steps to Immediately Rein in ICE Abuses

Democrats must call this what it is: a crisis of the Administration’s own making. That starts with calling for an immediate halt to dangerous operations and a restoration of basic law and order—steps Minnesota Democrats have already demanded. It also means refusing to write a blank check for ICE. Senate Democrats are right to oppose DHS funding that lacks real guardrails against abuse, and Senator Cortez Masto has put forward a smart alternative: redirecting the extraordinary funding windfall Republicans handed to ICE to instead fund local law enforcement.

Accountability must follow. The leadership of DHS, ICE, and CBP should be compelled to testify before Congress, as Democrats in both chambers are demanding. If Republicans refuse to exercise meaningful oversight, Democrats should do it themselves—through hearings and aggressive fact-finding, as the Minnesota delegation has already demonstrated. That includes demanding records and evidence related to serious abuses, as Representative Pressley recently did for all records related to the killing of Renee Good. And it also means pursuing impeachment where warranted, as many Democrats are now urging with respect to Secretary Noem.

Finally, Democrats, and all who truly value public safety in this country, should insist on independent scrutiny. ICE and CBP cannot be allowed to investigate themselves. Congress should demand the creation of an independent investigative body—or the appointment of a special prosecutor—to examine cases of serious abuse. And until ICE can demonstrate that it can operate lawfully and safely, at-large enforcement in dense urban areas should be paused. Public safety must come first.

Talking Points on Reining in ICE Abuses

This is a crisis of the Administration’s own making—and it demands immediate action.

Trump must rein in ICE and CBP, halt dangerous at-large operations, restore professionalism, and end enforcement tactics that are clearly spiraling out of control.

We must refuse blank-check funding for DHS without real guardrails, accountability, and enforceable standards.

Pouring billions into ICE without real guidance or oversight has weakened public safety and left communities more vulnerable, not more secure.

No one is above oversight and accountability.

Secretary Noem is incompetent and must go. Where misconduct rises to the level of abuse of power, impeachment is not radical—it is a constitutional responsibility.

DHS is asserting powers that no democratic society should tolerate: warrantless home entries, detention of US citizens, denial of counsel, and routine violations of constitutional rights.

ICE’s refusal to cooperate with local law enforcement has heightened danger for communities and officers alike.

ICE Needs a Top-to-Bottom Overhaul

Beyond the immediate and urgent need to halt dangerous operations and restore order, this moment demands something deeper: serious reform of ICE and the broader immigration enforcement system. The last few months have stripped away any remaining illusions about the risks of granting an agency extraordinary autonomy while holding it to lower standards than the rest of American law enforcement. Immigration enforcement is necessary—but it must be safe, disciplined, and professional. Show Americans that accountability and professionalism are not optional in federal law enforcement.

ICE and CBP have long operated with a degree of independence that would be unacceptable anywhere else in American policing. That lack of guardrails—combined with vague mandates, shifting political directives, and weak oversight—has produced an enforcement culture untethered from public safety norms. The result is not precision or control, but chaos: masked agents, unclear authority, dangerous tactics, and a growing conflict with the local police departments who are primarily responsible for keeping communities safe.

First, Democrats must set firm, non-negotiable standards for how immigration enforcement is conducted. If ICE and CBP are going to operate in American communities, they must do so visibly, lawfully, and with restraint. That means no masks, no anonymous operations, no intimidation tactics, and no enforcement that undercuts or conflicts with local police. Officers should clearly identify themselves, state their authority, and explain the reason for an interaction—just as any other law enforcement officer is required to do. Federal immigration authorities should also be held to the same liability standards as state and local law enforcement. These are not activist demands; they are policing fundamentals.

Democrats are already showing how this could be done. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act, introduced by Representatives Peters, Goldman, and Krishnamoorthi, and Senators Kelly and Gallego, sets clear limits on dangerous tactics and weapons. It restricts the use of chokeholds and reinforces basic standards of transparency and accountability. The Bivens Act in the House and the Constitutional Accountability Act similarly bring the standards already placed upon state and local law enforcement to federal officers—making federal officers civilly liable for certain egregious abuses, consistent with standards applied to state and local law enforcement. These reforms would send an important signal: immigration enforcement is not exempt from the rules that govern every other law enforcement officer in our country.

Second, Democrats must insist that ICE and CBP meet modern law enforcement training and professionalism standards. No officer should be interacting with the public—much less using force—without rigorous, standardized federal law enforcement training. The current approach of rushing thousands of recruits through shortened training pipelines is reckless. It endangers civilians, officers, and the integrity and legitimacy of law enforcement itself.

Here again, Democratic leadership is pointing the way forward. Proposals to strengthen training requirements, limit who can conduct at-large interior operations, and ensure officers are properly prepared before deployment reflect a commitment to public safety—not ideology. And they must be heeded.

Third, Democrats must force real oversight and independent accountability. An agency with the power to detain, arrest, and use force cannot be allowed to police itself. Democrats should continue demanding independent oversight, regular audits, and meaningful consequences for abuses—up and down the chain of command. That means, among other things, restoring the oversight bodies that the Trump Administration shut down.

Fourth, Democrats must reset enforcement priorities around real public safety. Immigration enforcement should focus on individuals who pose genuine safety threats, recent immigration violators, and those with final orders whose removal is imminent. Dragnet tactics that sweep up families, long-time residents, and bystanders do not make communities safer—they erode trust and divert resources from real crime.

Senator Gallego and 29 other Senate Democrats have made this point powerfully by calling out the diversion of thousands of law enforcement officers away from violent crime, human trafficking, and child exploitation and into mass immigration enforcement. That diversion has consequences. Democrats should keep drawing that line clearly: every hour spent chasing indiscriminate deportation quotas is an hour not spent keeping Americans safe.

Fifth, Democrats must reject the use of wartime authorities in immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement does not justify the abuse of extraordinary wartime or foreign policy authorities like the Alien Enemies Act or the Insurrection Act. Democrats are, and should be, unequivocal in opposing the use of these tools against civilian communities and in routine law enforcement situations.

Finally, Democrats must lead with reform—not retreat—because the cost of inaction is already measured in lives. This is no longer an abstract policy debate; it is a public safety emergency unfolding in real time. Restoring order means reasserting control over an agency that has been allowed to operate without sufficient standards, oversight, or accountability. By advancing serious, enforceable reforms—rigorous training requirements, independent oversight, clear limits on force, and a public safety-first enforcement strategy—Democrats can demonstrate that the rule of law is strengthened, not weakened, when federal law enforcement is disciplined, professional, and answerable to the public it serves.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant requests by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul to temporarily halt the immigration operation. She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Menendez questioned the government's motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

""I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?"" Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued that the situation on the street is so dire as to require the court to halt the federal government's enforcement actions.

""If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,"" Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

Brantley Mayers, a Justice Department attorney, said the government's goal is to enforce federal law. Mayers said one lawful action should not be used to discredit another lawful action.

""I don't see how the fact that we're also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge,"" Mayers said.

Menendez questioned where the line was between violating the Constitution and the executive's power to enforce the law. She also asked whether she was being asked to decide between state and federal policies.

""That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,"" she said.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

""I can't be the global keeper of all things here. Like, presumably that will be litigated,"" she said to the state's attorney.

Menendez made it clear that she was struggling with how to rule because the case is so unusual, and there are few precedents in case law to guide her.

""It's because this is important that I'm doing everything I can to get it right,"" she said.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday added urgency to the case.

Border czar to Minnesota

In other developments, President Donald Trump said he had a ""very good"" call with Walz about the latest shooting and that they are now on a ""similar wavelength."" It was an abrupt shift from Trump, who frequently derides Walz for his actions on immigration issues in Minnesota.

Trump also said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. The president's statement comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the public face of the crackdown, answered questions at news conferences over the weekend about Pretti's shooting. Trump posted on social media that Homan will report directly to him.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan would be ""the main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis"" during continued operations by federal immigration officers.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their request in an effort to restore the conditions that existed before the administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit ""legally frivolous"" and said Minnesota ""wants a veto over federal law enforcement."" They asked the judge to reject the request or to at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday that the lawsuit is needed because of ""the unprecedented nature of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we're looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we've seen something like this.""

Other state implications

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,"" the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday's shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing.

The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

Hotel where federal agents believed to be was targeted

On Sunday night, protesters targeted a Minneapolis hotel where federal agents were believed to be staying, blocking a major avenue on the edge of the University of Minnesota campus.

A freelance photographer working for The Associated Press saw smashed glass in the hotel lobby, as well as graffiti with obscenities and threats directed at ICE.

A Minneapolis police officer was inside the hotel and tried to provide aid to a federal agent who was injured. More officers from local and state agencies planned to move in to ""deescalate the situation, and make arrests,"" Minneapolis police said Monday in a statement.

But as they began to reach the scene and arrested two people, federal agents arrived and ""deployed chemical munitions,"" the police statement said. A DHS spokesperson said a statement on the situation would be provided later Monday.

Associated Press writers Jack Brook in Minneapolis and Mike Catlaini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

This story has been corrected to show the judge's name is Katherine Menendez, not Kathleen.

In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights.
In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents.
The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law.
“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney.","Connecticut state lawmakers said Monday that they will propose a bill allowing CT residents to sue federal law enforcement agents for violations of their constitutional rights.

The bill’s proposal is in response to the shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti is the second protester killed by federal immigration authorities in Minnesota this month, after Renee Good was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7.

“I’ve heard from many of my constituents who are concerned that this could happen here and who are looking to the state and our state leaders and to provide some assurance that Connecticut is doing what we can to protect our residents,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, during a press conference on Monday.

Connecticut would join several other states that have enacted similar laws, including California, Massachusetts, Maine and, most recently, Illinois.

“This is a well-established thing that we can do to make sure that if constitutional rights are violated, that the residents of the state can do something about it and can bring a lawsuit and can achieve justice,” said Lesser.

In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights. But there is no equivalent law allowing people to sue federal officials. In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents.

The 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics found that individuals do have a right to sue federal officials for damages relating to violations of people’s constitutional rights. But the court has not allowed a lawsuit under Bivens to proceed in more than 30 years, and a 2017 Supreme Court decision tightened its use even further.

Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Westfall Act, a 1988 law that protects federal employees from personal lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their professional duties, further limits individuals’ recourse.

“I think it’s important for folks to be able to rest assured that the Constitution of the United States means something. If that doesn’t mean something, I don’t know who we are, what this country is,” said Winfield.

Sen. President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said it was possible the law could be challenged by the federal government. The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law.

But Looney disagreed that the proposed Connecticut law was at odds with the U.S. Constitution.

“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney.

Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, welcomed debate on the proposed law in a statement he issued Monday.

“Anyone who breaks state or federal laws should be held accountable for their actions. In the meantime, the amped up rhetoric and the violence must end. Anyone who doesn’t like how the law is enforced is free to advocate for different laws, and to protest peacefully,” said Harding.

Democratic lawmakers said they had been working with the Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to draft the legislation.

There have been constitutional violations in Connecticut as ICE increased its presence here, said Chelsea Infinity-Gonzalez, ACLU-CT’s director of public policy and advocacy.

“ There’s operations ramping up all around us, in New York and Massachusetts, most recently in Maine. And so it truly is only a matter of time,” said Gonzalez.

Gonzalez said the ACLU was also working on legislation that would regulate the use of license plate readers so that the data collected was not used to assist federal law enforcement.

At the federal level, Connecticut politicians have widely criticized the shootings in Minnesota, and several have called for an independent investigation into the shooting. State investigators were not allowed access to evidence in the shooting of Good, and Drew Evans, superintendent of Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates police shootings, told reporters Saturday that federal officers had blocked his agency from the scene of Pretti’s shooting even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, calling on him to share records on the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to repeal “sanctuary policies” and allow detention centers to cooperate with ICE, and to provide the federal government with access to the state’s voter rolls.

Connecticut, along with 22 other states, has been sued in federal court by the Trump Administration for its voting records. The state in July joined 20 other states in a lawsuit pushing back against a directive from the federal government to provide data on people enrolled in SNAP.

In response to a question from CT Mirror, spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office Elizabeth Benton said the state “has not received such a letter” from Bondi and referred to earlier comments in which she said that any statements about hypothetical requests for data from the federal government would be “premature” and depend on the exact data requested.

Duff said during the press conference that the federal government was targeting Democratic-led states, and that Connecticut would “resist feverishly.”

“The federal government does not run elections, and we’re not going to give them data in order to try to make a mockery of our residents, our voters, and anyone else for their cruel and dangerous policies,” he said.

Connecticut’s congressional delegation last week voted against a bill that would fund the federal Department of Homeland Security. The bill passed the House of Representatives and is now headed to the Senate.

Hundreds of demonstrators braved freezing weather to take to the streets over the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, during a confrontation on Saturday.

Videos from the scene show the scuffle between federal officers and Pretti. Federal and state authorities have offered conflicting versions of what happened in the moments leading to the shooting.

Trump ordered federal agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants.

The Trump administration has described Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist"".

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said he was there ""to perpetuate violence"", saying he approached federal agents with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun.

Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man just before the shooting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti resisted their attempts to disarm him.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading ""sickening lies"" about what happened.

BBC Verify analysed multiple videos showing the moments just before the shooting. They show Pretti filming agents with his mobile phone. One of the agents pushes another person over, and Pretti then stands between that person and the agent.

The agent pepper-sprays him in the face and, as he tries to help the woman on the ground, more agents join and he is wrestled to the ground. None of the available videos shows Pretti holding a gun.

An agent in a grey jacket can be seen empty-handed as he reaches to remove something from Pretti's waist. He then turns away from Pretti, now holding what appears to be a pistol in his right hand.

Less than a second after this, an agent shoots Pretti. Ten shots are heard.

In filed testimony, two witnesses challenged the DHS account of what happened, both saying they did not see Pretti brandish a weapon.

But Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the videos were unclear and ""there is a lot we don't see"" in them so it was important to have an investigation.

President Donald Trump said local and state officials were ""inciting Insurrection"", suggesting they had called off local police from protecting federal immigration officers at the shooting scene.

Governor Walz strongly disputed the federal government's account of the incident. ""I've seen the video from several angles and it's sickening,"" he told reporters.

""Thank God we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It is nonsense, and it's lies,"" he said

Walz reiterated his call for trump to end ICE operations in Minnesota and urged protests to remain peaceful.

(COLORADO SPRINGS) — Thousands gathered in front of the Colorado Springs City Hall on Sunday, Jan. 25, in a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following the fatal shooting of VA Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

Protesters waved signs and yelled chants with sentiments such as telling ICE to “get out of everywhere” and repeating the names of Pretti and Renée Good, who died in a shooting involving ICE on January 7.

“What’s happening in America is not ok; I’m a mother of two small kids, and I don’t feel safe every day,” said protester Shannon Groom. “Alex Pretti is my exact same age.

Trump agrees to 'look into' pulling some ICE agents out of Minnesota, says Walz's office

We have more on the phone call that took place today between Donald Trump and Minnesota governor Tim Walz, which we covered per Trump’s perspective earlier.

According to a statement from Walz’s office, the two held a “productive” call where the president “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”.

Trump also agreed to talk to the Department of Homeland Security “about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case”, the statement says.

Per my colleague Hugo Lowell, Trump’s call with Walz comes amid widening public backlash to the aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota, which could be compounded with further bad news if a federal judge finds as early as today that Operation Metro Surge was broadly illegal.

The day so far

Good afternoon and thank you for reading our live coverage today.

Most of Monday’s political news stems from the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s death at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this weekend. State officials are trying to stop Donald Trump’s deployment of 3000 immigration agents to Minneapolis. Some local law enforcement are claiming that the feds are already blocking investigation of Pretti’s killing.

Here is a quick recap of where things stand.

Two federal judges are weighing cases that involve the legality of federal agents’ activity in Minneapolis. One case, which was argued this morning, challenged the legality of this surge. Another case, which will be argued at 2 pm local time, involves local officials’ claims that federal agents are getting in the way of their investigation of Pretti’s death.

Donald Trump is sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota on Monday night. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” the president said in a Truth Social post.

Chris Madel, an up-and-coming Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota, dropped out of the race because of the GOP’s “stated retribution on the citizens of our state.” In what the Minnesota Star Tribune described as a “stunning exit,” Madel also said: “United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong.” That Madel said this is, in fact, stunning: He provided legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who earlier this month shot and killed Renee Good.

Chuck Schumer, Senate Democratic leader, ramped up his request to separate Department of Homeland Security funding from a six-bill package. “Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,” Schumer said in a statement. “The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans… If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office said in a statement that he and Trump had a “productive” phone call where the president “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”. In the statement, Walz’s team said Trump agreed to talk with the Department of Homeland Security about making sure the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to investigate.

In Maine, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has arrested “more than 200 illegal aliens” in the past five days, assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Guardian in a statement.

Once again, DHS said that it was targeting the “worst of the worst” but highlighted the same four arrests of immigrants with criminal convictions that it shared when the immigration enforcement operation started last week in the Pine Tree state.

Department of justice fights court order requiring federal agents to preserve evidence in Alex Pretti's death

Trump administration officials are fighting a court order issued late Saturday that requires federal agents to preserve evidence in Alex Pretti’s death.

The temporary restraining order stemmed from a request from the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension (MBCA) and Hennepin county attorney’s office. They alleged that feds had stymied their investigative efforts of Pretti’s death at the hands of federal agents.

Trump’s justice department claimed in court papers that they “fail to establish that they will be irreparably harmed absent a temporary restraining order”.

They claim that federal agents “are already obligated to preserve the evidence at issue here under their own policies”.

They contend that the FBI gathered evidence from the scene of Pretti’s death “using appropriate collection and handling procedures, and that evidence is currently preserved and stored in a secure evidence room at the Minneapolis field office”.

“The evidence is being preserved; nothing has been destroyed or altered. [Customs and Border Protection] has preserved all relevant body-worn camera footage from the incident and will do so for 75 years.” They also said that ICE was in possession of “limited evidence and follows stringent requirements for the documentation, retention, and accountability of its investigative records and evidence”.

The justice department insists that Minnesota and Minneapolis officials don’t have a right to steer the feds’ evidence-handling procedures, “particularly procedures involving an immigration-enforcement incident”.

A court hearing on the TRO is scheduled for 2pm local time.

White House insists that Trump supports second amendment rights

Leavitt says, “The president supports the second amendment rights of law abiding American citizens. Absolutely.”

She goes on to caveat this by repeating the administration’s suggestions that Alex Pretti, who was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, was at fault. [A reminder that Pretti had a gun on his person but video footage shows he was holding his phone, not a weapon, when he was confronted by law enforcement.]

Leavitt says:

There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J Trump. So while Americans have a constitutional right to bear arms, Americans do not have a constitutional right to impede lawful immigration enforcement operations. And as any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk, and the risk of a force being used against you. And again, that’s unfortunately what took place on Saturday.

Leavitt is asked how many shots were fired, how many guns were discharged, and whether Alex Pretti’s gun went off or only the federal agents’ guns.

She says the investigation is ongoing and includes interviews with the agents involved.

Noem still has Trump's 'utmost confidence and trust' and continues to oversee DHS, says White House

Leavitt is asked if Tom Homan’s deployment to Minnesota should be taken as a sign that Trump is “dissatisfied” with the officials on the ground who handled the incident.

Leavitt says, “No,” adding that Kristi Noem “still has the [president’s] utmost confidence and trust” and says Noem is continuing to oversee the Department of Homeland Security and immigration enforcement across the country.

White House says CBP 'won't be needed' in Minnesota if Walz and Grey comply with anti-immigration measures

“That’s why President Trump spoke with Governor Walz directly this morning, and he has outlined a clear and simple path to restoring law and order in Minnesota,” Leavitt says.

Number one, governor Wallace, Mayor Frey and all Democrat leaders should turn over all criminal illegal aliens currently incarcerated in their prisons and jails to federal authorities along with any illegal aliens with active warrants or known criminal histories for immediate deportation.

Number two, state and local law enforcement must agree to turn over all illegal aliens who are arrested by local police.

And then thirdly, local police must assist federal law enforcement in apprehending and detaining illegal aliens who are wanted for crimes, especially violent crimes.

If Governor Walz and Mayor Frey implement these common sense, cooperative measures, that I will add, have already been implemented in nearly every single other state across the country, Customs and Border Protection will not be needed to support Ice on the ground in Minnesota.

Leavitt goes on to accuse Walz and Frey of “using their platforms to encourage leftwing agitators to stalk, record, confront and obstruct federal officers who are just trying to lawfully perform their duties”.

This, she claims, “has created dangerous situations, threatening both these officers and the general public and Minnesotans alike”.

“This is precisely what unfolded in Minneapolis on Saturday morning,” she adds.

Updated at 13.35 EST

“But let’s be clear about the circumstances which led to that moment on Saturday,” Leavitt goes on.

This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota for weeks. Governor Walz and the mayor, Jacob Frey, and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal, illegal aliens from our streets.

Leavitt says Saturday’s [fatal] shooting [of Alex Pretti] remains under active investigation by the FBI, homeland security and customs border officials.

“The administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” she says.

Sending armed agents into neighborhoods without adequate training is not an accident—it is policy.
King did not respond to state violence by asking for better public relations or gentler rhetoric.
If he were alive today, he would not ask ICE to behave more humanely while carrying out inhumane policies.","I was thirteen when I watched the Rodney King beating on the evening news with my father. The grainy footage was relentless and impossible. I credit that evening as my political awakening. I asked countless questions and received hours of patient answers. What has stayed with me is not only the horror of what was shown, but the collective astonishment that accompanies recurring episodes of graphic violence. The lesson in outrage is familiar: society confronts violence only when the public bears witness to its spectacular and undeniable reality.

In 1944, at age 15, returning by bus from an oratorical contest in Dublin, Georgia. King and his teacher, Mrs. Bradley, were seated when white passengers boarded. The bus driver enforced the cruelty of Jim Crow laws and ordered Black passengers—including King—to give up their seats. He stood up and obeyed the unjust law. He later described this moment as one of the angriest of his life, saying he was “the angriest I have ever been in my life,” and that the humiliation stayed with him for years. We all have memories that imprint into our souls.

Seeing ICE terrorize neighborhoods and detain innocent people—citizens and noncitizens alike—should be as morally jarring as “whites only” counters, hospitals, and water fountains once were. It is the kind of injustice that, when explained plainly, still shocks the conscience—especially of children, who have not yet learned to treat cruelty as normal. It will not be forgotten anytime soon.

Recent events make clear that this is not an aberration. In the past week alone, federal officials have doubled down on an enforcement strategy that prioritizes speed, visibility, and volume over preparation or restraint. The resulting violence is treated as unfortunate fallout rather than foreseeable consequence. That framing is not just misleading—it is false. What we are witnessing is not a failure of execution, but the execution of a plan.

I feel the cycle repeating. Shock, grief, and calls for accountability emerge immediately. One case involves police officers beating a limp body: another, a federal agent firing “defensive” shots through a driver’s-side window. King’s experience of racist America and our observations of 5-year-olds abducted in their driveways are the same; the state makes excuses, talks about the law, and blames victims. Coverage fixates on physical details, evidence, and personal histories.

Public violence demands resistance—it is part of our moral economy—but the selectivity of that attention is troubling. We are fluent in responding to abrupt emergencies and far less equipped to confront the slow boil of cultural and structural violence. King would praise the whistles in Minnesota while condemning the dog whistles from MAGA republicanism.

We should trust our eyes. There is nothing “self-defense” about the ICE shootings, and the administration’s claims that the victims are domestic terrorists (or anything else) are false. But the fatal shots were delivered months earlier, when the administration intentionally produced predictable suffering. Who did this? Why?

The answer is not found at the moment a trigger is pulled. It begins earlier, in offices where executive orders are drafted, training timelines shortened, and numerical targets elevated over human judgment. When preparation is compressed, oversight weakened, and escalation rewarded, violence is no longer accidental—it is structural. The question is not whether harm will occur, but who will be blamed when it does. When “defensive shots” were fired, again, in the morning hours of Jan. 24th Governor Walz responded: “Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”

Focus will be rightly placed on questions like, he was on the ground, how is that defensive? But how did thousands of agents of the state end up there? How is it that 85% of MAGA Republican and 64% of non-MAGA Republicans say ICE is “Just Right” or “Not Aggressive Enough?” Will there be another clear cover up?

Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that state violence must be judged by the conditions that make it normal, not merely by the individuals who carry it out. He resisted narrowing moral judgment to individual perpetrators because doing so allowed institutions to deflect responsibility onto “bad apples.” Decades of promises about body cameras and training have served as distractions from administrative recklessness and policy design. In what society, King would ask, is this behavior considered normal?

In Beyond Vietnam, King warned that a society reveals its moral commitments not through slogans, but through budgets and policy. A nation that “continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift,” he argued, “is approaching spiritual death.” The same logic applies here: priorities hardened into legislation produce predictable harm. As King put it, “We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values.”

This outcome was produced by an administration that turned neighborhoods into war zones for political purposes. Choosing escalation at every opportunity yields predictable results. Bureaucracy and executive orders kill far more effectively than individuals animated by avarice or malice. Valuing order over justice and privileging loyalty over morality is no longer an inflection point; it is openly rewarded.

This violence is bureaucratic before it is physical. Sending armed agents into neighborhoods without adequate training is not an accident—it is policy. Calling resulting deaths “failures” or “oversights” sanitizes decisions made in advance, for political gain, at the expense of human life. ICE in 2026 resembles the Birmingham Police Department in 1963. Kristi Noem and Bull Connor share the same playbook of state power suppressing dissent through intimidation and force. When 5,000 children walked out of school to protest segregation, Connor unleashed snarling dogs and fire hoses. Many children carried toothbrushes, knowing arrest was likely.

In the margins of a newspaper, King penned Letter from Birmingham Jail. Denied proper writing implements while held in solitary confinement, he wrote on scraps of paper—napkins and toilet paper among them. His message on the urgency of nonviolent direct action could not wait. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” he wrote, calling on people to break unjust laws and accept the consequences.

Donald Trump has not pulled the trigger, but his immigration policies cause needless pain, suffering, and death. They are grossly unpopular: a 2025 PRRI survey reports that only three in ten Americans support his immigration agenda. That unpopularity helps explain the strong reactions from neighbors, friends, and community members. Training adds another layer of risk. What once took roughly five months has been reduced to forty-seven days. Increased operational complexity paired with reduced preparation is a recipe for disaster. If a parent gives a four-year-old a gun, they are blamed. When an administration sends undertrained agents into the streets, it should be blamed as well.

All elected officials must be held to account. Softened language—“accidents happen” or “nothing we could do”—lets everyone off the hook. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did not mince words, telling ICE, “Get the F___ out!” Leaders can defund reckless operations, demand proper training, and insist on accountability. Citizens deserve competence, not excuses. Split-second decisions about detention and lethal force unfold in real time; adequate preparation is essential to protect both civilians and agents.

Cutting corners to staff the streets was a bureaucratic choice driven by headlines and numbers. Policies and procedures are violent in themselves, and they can be reversed—but that reality is missing from much of the coverage. Armed agents terrorizing neighborhoods is a serious problem, but focusing only on those who pull the trigger will not prevent future harm. Real change requires confronting the policies that put those agents and their weapons in neighborhoods in the first place.

King was a moral authority and a tactician, but above all, he was a man of action. In 2026, he would make clear that ICE is not part of the promise of any American Dream. The promise of opportunity revoked by a society that blocks justice while demanding law and order, King repeatedly warned, creates the conditions under which violence becomes more likely—not because people are impatient, but because justice has been systematically denied.

King did not respond to state violence by asking for better public relations or gentler rhetoric. He demanded disruption. He organized boycotts, marches, and mass refusal. He forced institutions to confront the cost of maintaining unjust systems. If he were alive today, he would not ask ICE to behave more humanely while carrying out inhumane policies. He would demand that those policies be stopped—and he would insist that elected officials choose between order and justice, knowing they cannot have both.

Structural violence is slow, often invisible, and lethal. Spectacle cannot be our measure of accountability. To prevent harm, we must confront not just bullets, but bureaucracy—the policies and political calculations that set violence in motion. Only then can outrage become action: defunding reckless operations, restoring meaningful training, and rejecting policies that treat communities as testing grounds for political theater.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bradley-andrews-18BAb3kNsGY-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:06:46.932277

They're Afraid to Tell Trump. - POLITICO,Jonathan Martin,,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2026/01/26/ice-shootings-are-freaking-out-the-gop-theyre-afraid-to-tell-trump-00746312,"So what are Republican elected officials doing to address what could prove calamitous, for the country and their political fortunes?
They plead with Trump and his advisers in private to calm tensions, as a handful did this weekend.
However, most officials hope one of their colleagues can do that work so they don’t have to play the heavy.
In another television interview, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky) deployed the “I’m-only-thinking-out-loud-here” approach of trying to get through to Trump and his aides.
“As I have often said, I support the Border Patrol, ICE and the critical work they do to enforce our laws,” Sen. David McCormick (R-PA) began.","Before we get to the private and public messages being transmitted, however, a word on what top Republicans actually believe about what has become a deepening crisis for the White House, based on my conversations over the last two days.

They are concerned more protests to the bloodshed may beget additional incidents, have little faith in DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and, from a raw political standpoint, worry the party has squandered the best issues it had when voters were otherwise frustrated with the cost of living: the border and public order.

Immigration, broadly, as one veteran senator granted anonymity to speak candidly told me over the weekend, is for the GOP what health care is for Democrats — a “home game.” Yet with viral images of Americans being shot in broad daylight replacing migrants stampeding across the country’s border, that advantage is quickly dissipating.

So what are Republican elected officials doing to address what could prove calamitous, for the country and their political fortunes?

To date, it’s the usual approach.

They plead with Trump and his advisers in private to calm tensions, as a handful did this weekend. However, most officials hope one of their colleagues can do that work so they don’t have to play the heavy. “You can talk to them” or “Can you talk to them?” are phrases I don’t need access to text chains to know are being relayed between top Republicans.

When lawmakers do reach Trump, the dialogue is similar to those private messages he posted last week from European leaders eager to get him off his Greenland fetish: Start with praise and flattery before moving to the heart of the matter.

And while hope may not be a strategy, as the saying goes, there’s a whole lot of hope among Republican officials — mostly that they don’t have to go public with their true feelings, because if they wait for a few days the president will consume so much media coverage he’ll recognize the depth of the crisis.

The first signs of that shift emerged Sunday night. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Josh Dawsey, Trump declined to say the officer who killed Alex Pretti had done the right thing and pronounced that “we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.” That came, it barely requires noting, all of one day after Trump justified the killing and his lieutenants did as well, in even starker terms.

Monday morning, Trump took concrete steps to marginalize Noem and Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, who have become the face of the feds in Minnesota, appointing a new point person in the state and new chain of command.

“I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,” the president announced about his border czar. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”

The sound you hear is the president, once again, sawing off the limb after his loyalists climbed out on it with what credibility they have in tow.

This all begs the question of why, if the president is so responsive to the press narrative, more in his party don’t speak out in ways that will shape the story.

They are, but you have to know how to decipher their language.

First, there’s the method of: “The president can’t fail, he can only be failed.”

Which means, Republicans blame Trump’s advisers rather than risk angering the president by assigning the most powerful leader in the world agency of his own.

“He is a dealmaker, and he’s getting bad advice right now,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said on CNN Sunday.

Stretching even further was Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a master student of the blame-advisers-not-Trump school: “Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”

Tillis is only looking to help the president and secure his legacy, you see.

In another television interview, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky) deployed the “I’m-only-thinking-out-loud-here” approach of trying to get through to Trump and his aides.

Rather than say: Hell yes, we should yank federal immigration officials from Minnesota and end this fiasco, Comer tried to say it this way on Fox:

“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, OK, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals?’”

Just asking questions, you know.

Then there’s the Senate sandwich.

Deliver the meat of the message, or at least a palatable version of it, but between to-be-sure paragraphs.

“As I have often said, I support the Border Patrol, ICE and the critical work they do to enforce our laws,” Sen. David McCormick (R-PA) began. “Irresponsible rhetoric and a lack of cooperation from Minnesota’s politicians are fueling a dangerous situation.”

Then came the news, delivered with the perfuming cover of a right-coded affinity group: “I also agree with the NRA and others — we need a full investigation into the tragedy in Minneapolis. We need all the facts.”

The conclusion: “We must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust. This gives our law enforcement officers the best chance to succeed in their difficult mission.”

Lastly, there’s that old reliable for politicians of all stripes: calls for hearings and an independent investigation.

Not coincidentally, one of the first Republicans to take this tack was Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who’s been somewhat liberated thanks to Trump’s decision to exact revenge on Cassidy for his 2021 impeachment vote by backing a primary challenger to the senator this year.

To Cassidy’s credit, he went further than most of his colleagues by saying what’s manifestly obvious: “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.”

Beating Cassidy to the punch, and in a sign of how the politics of immigration have shifted because of the killings, the House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew Garbarino requested ICE officials testify before his panel.

“Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect,” said Garbarino, by way of announcing his turn toward oversight.

There was no mention of Pretti or Renee Good, who were neither served nor protected, but the message was there if you knew where to look.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F56%2F20%2F996ce9554898b82bf17f6530c756%2Fu-s-congress-29492.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 16:58:23.337610

Federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse for the Veterans Administration, on Jan. 24.","Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein has joined 80 other cities in supporting a federal lawsuit filed by Minneapolis.

The lawsuit seeks to have the deployment of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis declared unconstitutional.

The action follows the fatal shooting of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in the Minneapolis area.

Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, along with dozens of other cities around the country, has sided with Minneapolis in a federal lawsuit seeking to have immigration officials removed from that city in the wake of the fatal shootings of a Minnesota mother and an ICU nurse.

The brief, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, was authored by attorneys for the city of Boston and co-signed by attorneys from 80 other cities and local governments across the country.

Minneapolis is asking a federal judge to rule that the deployment of federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection is unconstitutional.

Klein's announcement comes on the same day a hearing was held in a federal court in Minnesota about the state's lawsuit. As of 1 p.m. EST, no ruling had been issued in the case.

The Trump administration has sent about 3,000 federal immigration officers to Minnesota as part of ""Operation Metro Surge."" The officers were mainly deployed to the Minneapolis and St. Paul areas. Since their deployment, two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot by agents, and there have been increasing protests in the city related to their continued presence.

""What we're seeing in the Twin Cities is horrific, heartbreaking and more of the same illegal and unconstitutional tactics from the Trump-Vance administration that seemingly cares more about retribution than the rule of law,"" Klein said in a release. ""Two people have now been shot and killed in the streets, local governments are under threat, and residents continue to have to worry about federal agents upending their daily lives.""

Federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse for the Veterans Administration, on Jan. 24. Pretti's death came after the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, also 37, by an ICE agent.

Klein has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration and its decisions, filing or joining a number of federal lawsuits, including those challenging cuts to local funding that had already been appropriated by Congress and access to healthcare.

Mayor Andrew Ginther said in a statement he supports Klein's actions in co-signing the supportive brief in Minnesota, saying federal agents ""lack the training and standards that we hold our own police to.""

""Without proper measures to ensure public safety, as well as transparency and accountability, these agents are not making us safe - they are violating the Constitution and stoking chaos, pain and fear,"" Ginther said.

Klein's joining of the amicus brief comes about a month after ICE sent agents to Columbus and other parts of Ohio during ""Operation Buckeye."" Klein did not file any federal legal action regarding ICE's activities in Columbus, but he and other city leaders decried the tactics ICE was using, including operating without clear identification or uniforms showing they were federal agents.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/NCOD/88092103007-protest-01072026-skm-11.JPG?crop=5474,3079,x0,y285&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 15:07:03.351616

January 26, 2026

Happy snow day, State House Watchers.

We hope you’re warm, and that you have power, and that you shovel with care. And of course, that you have some time to enjoy today’s special beauty.

One thing you don’t have to do today is attend state legislative hearings. The NH House canceled today’s hearings and moved them to other days this week and early next week. The calendar of hearings below reflects the updated schedule.

We hope you’ll find some time today to take the many online actions described below. From rental housing, to public education, access to food, immigration and the death penalty, it will be another busy week for issues that matter a great deal to us all.

We’ll keep the commentary brief so that we can get this newsletter to you at last. We’ll simply say that the lives of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti mattered, as did the lives of Geraldo Lunas Campos, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, Parady La, Victor Manuel Diaz, and Heber Sanchez Dominguez who also died this year (2026) while in the custody if ICE. The cost of state violence is horror and heartache, and the loss of their unique Light. For these siblings, and for all who have died because of racism and cruelty, may we find ways to stay in the struggle for a just, peaceful, and more compassionate world.

ACTION ALERTS!

Many thanks for all of the actions you are taking to support good policies and oppose harmful ones. In addition to giving testimony in person, we have an opportunity to register our positions and share testimony online. You’ll need the date of the hearing, the committee name and the bill number. You’ll enter your name and contact information as well whether you represent an organization and/or are a lobbyist. You can sign-in on a bill until midnight the day of the hearing. Sign in for House bills here. Sign in for Senate bills here. You can also email the committee members: House committees here. Senate committees here.

Remember that if you’re planning to attend House committee hearings in person, they are located at Granite Place this year while renovations are being made at the LOB. Senate committee hearings continue to be held at the State House and in nearby state buildings, including the state library.

Here are the action alerts we’ve received from partners for this coming week.

Today - Protect transgender rights.

OPPOSE SB 268, permitting classification of individuals based on biological sex under certain limited circumstances. This bill was a retained bill from 2025. The House passed it on January 8, and now it heads to Governor Ayotte. This bill is nearly identical to the so-called “bathroom bill” she vetoed last spring. Please call the governor and urge her to VETO it (603-271-2121).

Tuesday, January 27 - PRIORITY BILL - Protect worker rights.

OPPOSE HB 1704, permitting public employees to bargain individually with public employers without any intervention. The NH AFL-CIO shares that this bill “undermines exclusive representation – the core of collective bargaining; it creates administrative chaos because employers would have to negotiate hundreds or thousands of individual contracts while trying to manage the legal risk from inconsistent agreements; exposes cities and towns to lawsuits and turns normal labor activity into criminal conduct; and will increase property taxes that you pay because of the increased costs to cities and towns, because of more HR staff, more lawyers, more lawsuits, and more turnover.” NEA-NH has additional information here. This anti-worker, anti-union bill has a public hearing in the House Labor Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 3:15 PM at Granite Place, room 159. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, contact the committee, and show up at the hearing.

Tuesday, January 27 – PRIORITY BILLS - Protect tenant rights and immigrant families.

OPPOSE HB 1336, allowing exceptions to the cap on residential security deposits for applicants not meeting standard approval criteria. From NH Legal Assistance: “By allowing landlords to double the security deposit charged, we are making housing less affordable. Not only do renters have to come up with twice the money up front, but it leaves them with fewer resources for continuing to pay the rent, moving costs, regular expenses like childcare and utilities…not to mention emergencies.” It has a hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 10:30 AM in Room 231 at Granite Place. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, contact the committee, and show up for the hearing.

OPPOSE HB 1709, relative to prohibiting the rental of residential property to individuals unlawfully present in the United States. From the NH Immigrant Rights Network: “Enacting such a law would place housing providers in the legally precarious position of screening people based on nationality and immigration status – practices that are definitively prohibited under federal and state housing discrimination laws. Landlords cannot and should not screen tenants to establish citizenship or immigration status. They may not treat tenants differently based on citizenship, nationality or ethnicity. They are certainly not in the position to determine whether a prospective tenant is lawfully present, whether they had an obligation to report their status, and whether they reported their status accurately.” This reckless and discriminatory bill has a public hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 2 PM in Room 231 at Granite Place. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, contact the committee, and show up for the hearing.

SUPPORTSB 623, relative to requirements for law enforcement officers assisting in immigration enforcement. This bill is called the ""Granite State No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act,” and would require that each officer shall clearly display either their name or their badge number; no officer shall wear any facial covering or mask; and no officer shall disable or disengage their body-worn camera.” This positive bill has a public hearing in Senate Judiciary on Tuesday, January 27 at 1:40 PM in SH, Room 100. Please sign in to support this bill and contact the committee.

Tuesday, January 27 – Ensure that hungry children are fed.

SUPPORT SB 517, relative to the responsibility of local school districts to provide meals to students during school hours, reimbursing schools for meals provided to students at no cost, and making an appropriation therefor. This bill would increase the income eligibility for free school meals to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, giving more kids access to the food they need to learn and helping working families succeed. It has a public hearing in the Senate Education Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 10 AM in the Map Room at the State Library. Please sign in to support and contact the committee.

Wednesday, January 28 – Oppose the death penalty.

OPPOSE HB 1047, relative to the offense of capital murder. This bill makes it a capital murder offense to knowingly cause the death of the governor or governor-elect of New Hampshire, a member or member-elect of the executive council, or any member or member-elect of the New Hampshire senate or New Hampshire house of representatives, or any candidate for any such offices after such candidate has been nominated at his or her party's primary, when such killing is motivated by knowledge of the foregoing capacity of the victim. It has a public hearing in the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, January 28 at 11 AM in Room 159, Granite Place. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, and contact the committee.

Wednesday, January 28 – No masks for law enforcement cooperating with ICE.

SUPPORTHB 1142, relative to requirements for law enforcement officers assisting in immigration enforcement. This bill mandates that these officers must identify themselves by name, badge number, and agency while stating that they are operating under the authority of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Additionally, the bill requires that these officers remain unmasked during their operations under the 287(g) agreement. It has a public hearing in the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, January 28 at 3:30 PM in Room 159, Granite Place. Please sign in to support and share testimony, and contact the committee.

Thursday, January 29 – Protect public education.

OPPOSE SB 101, authorizing parents to enroll their children in any public school in the state. From NEA-NH: “This bill, with some amendments, will go to the Senate on Thursday, January 29 for a floor vote. Passage of this bill would upend the current open enrollment law that many school districts are currently trying to grapple with at their annual meetings. As amended, SB 101 would require all school districts to adopt an application and transfer process to allow non-resident students from other New Hampshire school districts to enroll in their schools. The bill only gives a limited number of exceptions as reason for denial of such a transfer and spells out more specifically what the resident district would owe the receiving district in tuition. This all will need to be in place by July 1st of this year! This is too much, too fast, and the fiscal, logistical and educational impacts of such a law have not been thought through thoroughly. Before the New Hampshire Senate votes on mandatory open enrollment, contact your state senator and urge them to hit the pause button on SB 101!

Friday, January 30 – Require transparency for immigration enforcement.

SUPPORTHB 1364, requiring quarterly reports from counties, municipalities, or any other political subdivisions of the state that enter into certain agreements with the federal government concerning assistance with federal immigration enforcement. This positive bill has a public hearing in the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on Friday, January 30 at 11:30 AM in Room 159, Granite Place. Please sign in to support and share testimony, and contact the committee.

Monday, February 2 – Protect food assistance.

SUPPORT HB 1750, making a supplemental appropriation to the department of health and human services for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This positive bill would make sure that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has the dollars to keep SNAP running. Without this bill, over 76,000 New Hampshire residents will lose access to SNAP - and to food. We must make the necessary state investment to ensure that SNAP remains fully operational. This bill has a public hearing on Monday, February 2 at 11 AM in Granite Place, room 230. Please sign in to support and contact the committee.

Get drawn into the nerve-wracking decision rooms as this unsettling picture shows us what could become our future if the right choices are not made today. Watch the film (on Netflix) and then join us on zoom for a discussion about this film and what actions we can take now. Jeremy Love of Back from the Brink will lead the discussion to help us find a sense of purpose instead of hopelessness. Before watching the movie, we recommend you take a look at Back from the Brink's Beginner's Guide to Nuclear Weapons. Accessing the film: If you are not able to access this movie on your own, but would like to be a part of this discussion, let us know (info@nhpeaceaction.org). If there are enough people who need access to the movie, we will attempt to connect people to watch the movie together. As you watch the movie, think about how you feel about the threat of nuclear war, what you think is realistic considering the actions of current world leaders, and how you feel life would change after a nuclear attack.

This Congress has abdicated its oversight role, allowing immigration enforcement to grow into the largest law enforcement force in the country, with devastating human costs.","January 26, 2026 – We condemn the killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis as the latest in a mounting toll of deaths tied to immigration enforcement operations, including the killing of Minnesota resident Renee Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) agent earlier this month, the killing of Keith Porter by an off-duty federal agent, and other fatal encounters involving federal law enforcement across the country. Since the start of President Trump’s second term, Alex Pretti is the fifth person to be shot and killed be federal immigration officers. Federal immigration agents have fired weapons at civilians in at least 19 documented incidents as part of the administration’s enforcement crackdown. We demand accountability and an end to this cycle of sanctioned violence.

These deaths demonstrate a broader pattern of lawlessness, lack of accountability, and erosion of civil rights under the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). What we are witnessing is not isolated misconduct but the normalization of a federalized, unaccountable police force operating with impunity in American cities. This is the infrastructure of authoritarianism taking root in real time.

Let us be clear: the violence federal immigration agents are bringing into Minneapolis sits within a long American tradition of state power used to surveil, control, and punish Black and Brown communities. But the scale and brazenness of this moment mark a dangerous escalation. This is a humanitarian crisis. This is a civil rights crisis. This is a constitutional crisis.

Federal obstruction of independent investigations has made matters worse. State officials and local law enforcement agencies have faced repeated resistance and continue to be denied meaningful access to evidence and crime scenes necessary to conduct full and transparent reviews and investigations. When governors and attorneys general cannot investigate deaths in their own states, accountability has collapsed.

These egregious acts by federal agents are in defiance of the rule of law and require Congress’ immediate action. Instead of empowering ICE and DHS with billions of additional dollars in new funding, we call on every U.S. Senator to vote NO on any legislation that funds ICE or DHS surveillance, intelligence, and enforcement operations, and we formally request immediate meetings within 48 hours with both the Senate Democratic Caucus and Senate Republican Caucus regarding the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the urgent need for congressional intervention.

This Congress has abdicated its oversight role, allowing immigration enforcement to grow into the largest law enforcement force in the country, with devastating human costs. The Senate must act now. Further funding without accountability is further abdication of your responsibility.

What I saw will haunt me forever. | Opinion - USA Today,Patty O'Keefe,,,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2026/01/26/ice-detained-us-citizens-minnesota-arrests/88304880007/,"Imagine if you heard that heavily armed, masked agents were going door-to-door where you live, violently grabbing people from gardeners to grandparents – no questions asked, no warrants offered.

When we drove to the scene, Brandon and I saw several ICE agents getting back into two unmarked vehicles.

I borrow occasional eggs or vanilla from the neighbor on my right when I get caught short baking. My partner shovels our elderly neighbor’s sidewalk; she knit him a hat in gratitude. The folks down the street watch our cats when we’re away. In other words, a pretty typical American neighborhood, perhaps not unlike your own.

Imagine if you heard that heavily armed, masked agents were going door-to-door where you live, violently grabbing people from gardeners to grandparents – no questions asked, no warrants offered. What would you do? Especially if you knew that having more community members as observers decreases the likelihood those masked agents will use violence.

That’s what my friend Brandon and I were doing on Jan. 11. We heard reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pepper spraying the car of an observer blocks from my house and went to warn others. I am a U.S. citizen and resident of Minneapolis for more than 14 years; this is a place where treating others as you wish to be treated is more than a saying.

When we drove to the scene, Brandon and I saw several ICE agents getting back into two unmarked vehicles. They turned down a side street and we followed for about 40 seconds, blowing our whistles and honking our horns – to warn our neighbors that ICE had come.

We did so knowing that monitoring and sounding the alarm about actions undertaken by government agents is our legally protected right. And any government that claims to be of, by and for the people must protect this right, not attack people of good conscience who exercise it.

But attack us is what ICE did. The agents got out of their vehicle, surrounded our car and yelled at us to stop following. On their way back to their vehicles, one of the agents suddenly turned around, as if deciding, “Hey, why not,” and walked back to my car and pepper sprayed into the vents near the front windshield.

'You guys gotta stop obstructing us – that's why that lesbian b---- is dead'

Brandon and I were paralyzed with shock, as our eyes and throats started to burn. When we did not immediately turn the car around, the ICE agents returned and, without warning or asking us to exit the vehicle, smashed the front windows of my car, dragged us out and arrested us.

They separated us. I was put in a car alone with three agents. When they got in and shut the doors, the taunting began.

One agent took a photo of me and showed it to the others, laughing. Another called me ugly. His colleague, apparently referring to Renee Good, said, “You guys gotta stop obstructing us – that’s why that lesbian b---- is dead.” In the presence of these masked men with weapons strapped to their bodies – men who claim to be safeguarding our cities – I felt only terrorized and vulnerable.

When we got to the Whipple Federal Building, they shackled my ankles. I asked four times to make a phone call but was denied that legal right. I had to beg for water and to be allowed to relieve myself in another crowded cell with a toilet behind a short wall.

On my way to that cell, I passed holding cells filled with people who appeared to be of Latino and East African descent. The despondent faces and the screaming, wailing and pleading from these men, women and children – reportedly as young as 5 years old – will forever haunt me. But perhaps more haunting still was the sound of agents nearby laughing. Are our lives all just a joke to them?

Eight hours later, I was released without charges because even these agents had no credible claim I had done anything wrong.

ICE is arresting people without cause. We can stand up to tyranny.

President Donald Trump and his administration spread lies about our neighbors based on what they look like or how they speak, all while making us less safe.

In the Twin Cities alone, we’ve seen people arrested without cause while doing their jobs and a grandfather pulled out of the shower and taken into the freezing cold in nothing but his underwear and a blanket. Local schools were forced to cancel classes after ICE tackled staff and tear gassed students, according to the teachers union, while raiding Roosevelt High School.

These actions endanger us. They are designed to terrorize our community with unchecked, unaccountable brutality.

When ICE detained me, the two other people in my cell said they were Marine Corps veterans. These women said they enlisted for the same reason they felt compelled to act as ICE observers – to protect their fellow Americans.

One of those veterans – scraped up and bruised at both wrist and ankle from the ICE agents’ aggression – talked about how ironic and shocking it was that the first time she had a gun pointed at her it was by the very government she swore an oath to serve.

I’m lucky to be back at home; I can return to my job, the people I love and my community. The hundred or so people I saw in that ICE facility may never again see the homes that they’ve built and the families they’ve nurtured. After being killed by Border Patrol and ICE in the past 12 months, Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Keith Porter and dozens of others who died in custody are only memories to their families. And our Twin Cities remain under siege by masked militia answering to a regime that spreads lies and sows fear in order to divide us and distract us while its leaders gut our health care, drive up prices and hand more money to their billionaire backers.

But in the United States of America, people who believe in liberty and justice for all stand up to tyranny. We sound the alarm. We support our neighbors. Now is the time for us to join together. And to tell Congress to protect our freedoms by refusing to fund these assaults against us.

Bondi’s letter marked the first time that the Trump administration implicitly tied its immigration enforcement actions to its quest for voters’ data.
Over the past month and a half, the Trump administration has sent over 3,000 federal agents to the state.
The department also said the state had no right to challenge the enforcement of federal immigration law.
Menendez is also overseeing a class-action lawsuit by Minneapolis residents challenging the aggressive tactics federal immigration agents have used against protesters, legal observers and members of the media.","Minnesota state attorneys alleged in a court hearing Monday that President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are attempting to force the state to surrender its sovereignty — in particular, its control over elections — through the massive federal immigration operation in the Twin Cities region.

In the hearing, the state attorneys presented the letter Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Gov. Tim Walz (D) over the weekend as evidence of the Trump administration’s extortion campaign against Minnesota.

In that letter, Bondi demanded that the state make multiple concessions, including forfeiting its voter registration records, to the federal government in order to “restore the rule of law.” Bondi sent the letter on the same day that federal Border Patrol agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis while he was acting as a legal observer of immigration operations.

While the attorney general didn’t explicitly claim that the Trump administration would end its aggressive immigration raids if the state complied with her demands, Minnesota officials have interpreted the letter as Bondi leveraging the chaos unleashed by federal agents to extract concessions from the state.

“It’s a shakedown letter,” Brian Scott Carter of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office argued in court Monday in a hearing over the state’s lawsuit to end the Trump administration’s ongoing aggressive immigration raids there. “That’s what you expect from someone who is extorting you.”

Among her demands, Bondi ordered the state to give the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division access to Minnesota’s unredacted voter rolls, part of the department’s broader campaign to access American voters’ confidential personal data under the false pretext of rooting out widespread election fraud. For weeks, the department has sought Minnesota’s voter data — and data from several other states — but has largely done so through legal threats.

Bondi’s letter marked the first time that the Trump administration implicitly tied its immigration enforcement actions to its quest for voters’ data.

The attorney general also demanded that the state give the Trump administration’s data on its Medicaid and supplementary food assistance programs, end “sanctuary policies” and actively devote its own law enforcement resources to supporting the immigration raids.

In its totality, the letter amounted to an assault on Minnesota’s sovereignty, demanding that it forfeit its ability to make and enforce its own laws and maintain its voter rolls without oversight from the executive branch, which does not have authority over elections.

Lindsey Middlecamp, another attorney arguing on behalf of the state Monday, described Bondi’s note as “a ransom note.”

“Their message is clear,” Middlecamp said. “Minnesota can change its laws and policies or suffer invasion of mass armed forces.”

The state has asked a federal judge to temporarily pause the immigration enforcement operation, arguing that it violates its Tenth Amendment rights by serving as the Trump administration’s primary tool to coerce the state politically.

Over the past month and a half, the Trump administration has sent over 3,000 federal agents to the state.

Alongside Bondi’s letter, Minnesota attorneys highlighted other statements and actions that they believe signal an ongoing extortion campaign against the state, including a recent social media post from Trump promising “a day of retribution” for Minnesota.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is presiding over the state’s lawsuit, largely agreed with the state attorneys that recent actions by the Trump administration, including the weekend’s fatal shooting, were deeply alarming. However, the judge also repeatedly warned that she was very limited in how she could grant the state immediate relief.

In its defense of the surge, the DOJ claimed that the operation wasn’t meant to force Minnesota to change its policies but to “make up for harms caused” by its policies. The department also said the state had no right to challenge the enforcement of federal immigration law.

Menendez appeared skeptical of the department’s defense, saying that Bondi’s letter suggested a “quid pro quo.” She also noted that the state was challenging a single law enforcement operation and not the enforcement of immigration law in general.

The judge said a ruling on the state’s request “might take time” before adjourning Monday’s hearing.

Menendez is also overseeing a class-action lawsuit by Minneapolis residents challenging the aggressive tactics federal immigration agents have used against protesters, legal observers and members of the media.

Earlier this month, she ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol could not detain or use tear gas against people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Menendez’s order in that lawsuit last week.

The killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol over the weekend unleashed another wave of unrest across the state. Pretti’s death came just over two weeks after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old mother-of-three Renee Good.

Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens who were observing the actions of federal agents before their deaths.

Hours after Pretti’s death, Bondi promoted her letter to Walz on Fox News Sunday. She said she sent the letter Sunday in order to demand that the governor “better support President Trump.”

“He better support the men and women in law enforcement because if he doesn’t, we are, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” Bondi claimed.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257959135-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:07:08.285756

With the second murder of a Minneapolis citizen at the hands of untrained, immunity-drunk, and predatory federal agents, Democrats must fundamentally shift their approach to immigration policy. It’s long past time for the party to move past its learned helplessness in the face of MAGA bloodlust fantasies about an invading horde of undocumented immigrants—and to vindicate the human rights of workers and neighbors confronting Gestapo-style seizures, renditions, and executions of a lawless invading force. Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old VA nurse shot 11 times in the back after being thrown to the ground by federal goons, was documenting their abuses in the hopes of halting them and returning our federal government to some semblance of moral responsibility. The bare minimum that national Democrats can do in his memory is to dismantle the ICE bureaucracy of terror once and for all.

After Pretti’s execution on Saturday, a key swing bloc of Senate Democrats had signaled that they would vote no on the House-passed appropriations bill that would deliver $10 billion in additional funding for ICE. This is on top of the tripling of the agency’s budget secured in last summer’s tax-and-spending bill. House GOP leaders had already carved out the ICE appropriation into a separate bill funding the Department of Homeland Security, so that another swing bloc of right-leaning Democrats would support it after a number of their pet spending priorities were attached to the legislation. That tactic was also garnering support from Democratic senators, with Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray of Washington all but assuring that Republicans would land the seven Democratic votes required to avoid a filibuster. Yet now that the feds have murdered another Minneapolis resident, Democratic support for the measure has collapsed, leaving GOP majority leader John Thune with the option of either blowing up the filibuster or stripping out DHS funding as a standalone bill that wouldn’t clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold, and thereby potentially touching off a partial government shutdown.

In material terms, the Senate vote wouldn’t do much to slow down the rampaging ICE invasions, given the agency’s vast $85 billion annual budget; ICE continued its marauding national tour during last year’s record-long government shutdown after all. But in political terms, the Democrats must not sidestep this battle. Democrats had previously relied on strong polling support for Trump’s immigration views to rationalize their passivity on the issue—yet public opinion is turning against ICE. A YouGov poll released on Saturday, hours before Pretti’s execution, showed 46 percent of all respondents backing the agency’s abolition, compared to 41 percent opposing it. The gap widens to 12 percent among independent voters—now the largest segment of the electorate—with 47 percent backing ICE’s abolition, and 35 percent opposing. Fifty-percent of respondents said they strongly disapprove of ICE, and just 24 percent of independents registered support for the agency. There’s every reason to believe that these negative numbers will continue to grow in the wake of Pretti’s horrific murder.

As political scientist David Faris recently argued in The Nation—again, prior to Pretti’s killing—Democrats cannot continue their dilatory enabling role in backing the rise of an immigration police state:

If the party can’t take a stand here for their own voters in the Twin Cities and elsewhere who are effectively living under an open-ended, vengeful military occupation, it may fritter away what looks like a decisive advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. Many Democratic voters now keen to have the party begin the long fight to reclaim basic constitutional protections and democratic traditions shredded by the Trump regime would be discouraged from turning out this November if the party refuses to meet this latest crisis with anything other than polite consultant-massaged demands to institute improved training protocols for ICE goons poised to terrorize our cities.

Unfortunately, the political exigency here stands athwart a dismal Democratic record of preserving status-quo state predation in immigration policy. Over the past decade of xenophobic immigrant-baiting on the right, the leaders of the Democratic Party have adopted their standard difference-trimming playbook to an issue that was always a stark question of basic human rights and basic human decency. The MAGA claim that the United States was in the grip of a violent immigrant crime wave was a blatant lie, as were scores of related dehumanizing slurs, from the nonsensical assertion that immigrants were bankrupting Social Security and health coverage to the urban legend that Haitian immigrants were eating the pets belonging to their neighbors in Springfield, Ohio. (Indeed, the ICE mobilization in Minneapolis is in response to another discredited battery of MAGA lies about a massive scheme of welfare fraud allegedly perpetrated by Somali-run daycare centers in Minnesota—though just how an armed Freikorps mobilization is expected to combat the accounting-based conduct of welfare fraud has never been explained.)

Occasionally, Democratic lawmakers would try to swat down some of the right’s most lurid and baseless claims, but they also took great care to grant the basic premise of this hate campaign: that border enforcement in this country was broken and that some vast unspecified cohort of undocumented immigrants were, in some vague and implausible way, preying on the birthright safety and prosperity of native-born Americans. That’s why President Barack Obama oversaw a greater volume of deportations than Donald Trump had, prior to the present Trump administration’s mass deportation policy; it’s also why, once you combine interior removals of immigrants with administrative returns at or near the border, the Biden White House clocked a higher number of immigrants exiting the country in the first eight months of its final year than the second Trump administration has during the same time frame in 2025. It’s why Biden and his Democratic allies on the Hill continued increasing ICE’s budget lines. And it’s why the same Democratic Senate caucus now belatedly trying to stake out a dissenting position on state-sanctioned murder meekly rolled over to ensure the passage of the Laken Riley Act, which laid the groundwork for ICE’s rolling siege on Democratic-led cities.

The reasoning behind the House appropriations bid to continue spiking ICE funding is very much of a piece with this long train of Democratic capitulations on right-wing immigration crackdowns: If the party once again submits to the right-wing consensus on immigration, it won’t suffer a defection of highly coveted (if increasingly mythical) moderate voters in the next election cycle.

But the flagrantly fascist actions of the Trump White House have upended even the milquetoast logic of traditional Democratic acquiescence. There’s no middle ground to be staked out in a murderous authoritarian siege. In addition to the dramatic shift against Trump’s immigration program in opinion surveys, there’s now a mass revulsion against ICE in unlikely forums like NFL Reddit boards. For a political establishment that’s spent the past decade bending over backward to accommodate the smallest errant grievance from Trump-voting diner patrons, that should be a five-alarm wake-up call.

And aside from self-interested electoral calculations, the moral case against allowing ICE to survive is now unanswerable. In a powerful YouTube video posted shortly after Pretti’s execution, New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie made the straightforward case that the administration’s concerted release of ideological death squads in US cities renders Trump’s presidency illegitimate. Bouie doesn’t cite manifestos from the margins of political life, but rather section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which forbids insurrectionists against the United States from holding federal office, and the language of the Declaration of Independence. That strikes me as a sound fundamental basis for the Democrats to finally act with genuine moral authority on a genuine moral issue.

The present crisis also calls to mind the counsel of Martin Luther King Jr. in “A Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” as he surveys the callow lecturing of his self-appointed Job’s consolers in the white moderate wing of liberalism. King wrote:

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s greatest stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jeffries-schumer-spine.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:58:34.109352

Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz has blamed “untrained” federal officers for the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.","Protests are continuing in Minnesota after federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis Saturday. He was an intensive care unit nurse in the Minneapolis Veterans Health Care System who was filming officers on his phone during a protest against President Trump’s immigration crackdown in the city. His killing comes just weeks after ICE agents fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three in Minneapolis, and after Friday’s demonstrations, where over 50,000 people took to the streets of downtown Minneapolis protesting against ICE as thousands of residents held a general economic strike.

Federal agents claimed that Pretti was a violent “gunman” who threatened to “massacre” law enforcement, but video evidence and witness statements directly contradict their account. Video footage shows Pretti being wrestled to the ground by several law enforcement officers before being shot 10 times in less than five seconds. The videos show Pretti coming to the defense of a woman who was shoved to the ground by a federal officer. The officer then sprays Pretti with a chemical agent, before tackling him to the street. Six agents surround Pretti on the ground, and at least one appears to fire at him at close range. They then step away from Pretti’s body, and one officer appears to fire six shots at Pretti’s motionless body. Pretti had no criminal record and had a legal permit to carry a firearm, which he never took out.

Pretti’s parents released a statement after his killing, saying, “We are heartbroken but also very angry. The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.”

The Department of Homeland Security has blocked local investigators from probing the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Protests erupted in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti’s killing.

Protester: “What we’ve seen is that the community has been talking to each other as real people, and these people have come in and been hurting us. They’ve been attacking us when we’ve been doing nothing but following the law, peacefully observing, and then they decide to gang up and kill one of us.”

NBC News is reporting that President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act to quell protests against ICE in Minneapolis. Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz has blamed “untrained” federal officers for the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Here’s Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “How many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values? How many times must local and national leaders must plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation?”

Meanwhile, the NRA issued a statement condemning the Trump administration’s claims that justified Pretti’s killing because he was carrying a weapon, saying, “This sentiment … is dangerous and wrong. Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”

The NBA postponed Saturday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors after federal agents shot and killed Pretti. The Timberwolves’ head coach Chris Finch denounced ICE’s killing of Pretti ahead of the game.

Chris Finch: “For the second time in less than three weeks, we’ve lost another beloved member of our community in the most unimaginable way. As an organization, we are heartbroken for what we are having to witness and endure and watch. And we just want to extend our thoughts, prayers and concern for Mr. Pretti.”

The NBA Players Association also released a statement saying, “Following the news of yet another fatal shooting in Minneapolis, a city that has been on the forefront of the fight against injustices, NBA players can no longer remain silent. Now more than ever, we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice.”",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/01/80701/full_hd/hd1-AlexPretti.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:58:39.562526

One such complication: The federal officer charged by state prosecutors for a crime committed while on duty could move any such case to a federal court.
If federal officers understood that they could and might well be held liable for outrageous conduct, they might think twice before engaging in it.","In the wake of another fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, many people are wondering what can be done. The answer has been right in front of us all along.

Despite the incredulity with which some legal observers meet the idea, state and local prosecutors can prosecute federal officials for violating state criminal laws. Prosecutors should be gathering and securing evidence and seriously considering filing charges — sooner rather than later.

Not every prosecution will succeed, and all will face obstacles that are built into our legal system. But critically, bringing these state and local prosecutions could produce deterrent effects that are so desperately needed now.

U.S. law, at least theoretically, provides a range of options for holding government officers accountable; the problem is that many of those options are unavailable in practice where federal officers are concerned.

Consider, for instance, federal criminal prosecution — which should be an option for federal officers who commit murder. As recently as 2019, the first Trump administration told the Supreme Court that federal criminal prosecution would be the appropriate remedy in cases in which an officer used lethal force without justification.

But the current administration didn’t investigate the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good, and it has already stated that the Department of Homeland Security (which has no experience investigating law enforcement shootings) will run the investigation into the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti. A future president could potentially pursue charges for an offense — like the recent shootings of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti — that has no statute of limitations. But that assumes President Trump won’t first pardon the responsible officer(s).

What’s more, a series of decisions by the Supreme Court has made it all but impossible to hold federal officers liable for damages in federal lawsuits for violating our constitutional rights — such as in a February 2020 decision involving a Border Patrol agent who shot and killed an unarmed teenager without provocation.

Instead, the historical backstop for a lack of federal accountability, going all the way back to the founding, has been state law. States prosecuting federal officers for crimes committed in the course of their federal duties would certainly face complications, but those hurdles would not be insurmountable.

One such complication: The federal officer charged by state prosecutors for a crime committed while on duty could move any such case to a federal court. But that would simply change the courthouse (and the judge and the jury pool). State prosecutors would still be seeking to enforce state law — which, among other things, means that any conviction would not be subject to the president’s pardon power.

A second potential hurdle to clear: A federal officer defendant could argue that he’s entitled to what’s known as “Supremacy Clause immunity.” Vice President JD Vance, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, have all claimed that this immunity is absolute, but they’re all wrong. As highly regarded (and conservative) former Judge Michael McConnell wrote on behalf of the Denver-based federal appeals court in 2006, “a federal officer is not entitled to Supremacy Clause immunity unless, in the course of performing an act which he is authorized to do under federal law, the agent had an objectively reasonable and well-founded basis to believe that his actions were necessary to fulfill his duties.”

In other words, the ability to prosecute federal law enforcement officers who commit state crimes in the course of their duties would turn on whether a reasonable officer in their position would have believed that their actions were necessary to fulfill their duties. That standard may be appropriately strict, to maintain federal authority when it is needed (think of federal protection for civil rights protesters in the 1960s), but at least based on the videos so many of us have seen, it should not be impossible.

Nor should state and local prosecutors think this power to bring charges under state law exists — or should exist — only when the offense results in a death. Every day, Americans are seeing an unending stream of videos showing federal officers destroying property, pepper-spraying individuals on a whim and using what at least appear to be excessive degrees of force. Many, if not most, of these acts are potential violations of state criminal laws. If those crimes are not “reasonable and well-founded” in light of federal duties, the officers can be convicted and penalized, even jailed.

What prosecutors should be doing now is what Minnesota prosecutors did after the murder of Renee Good: establishing online portals to which individuals can upload their videos and other evidence. Will there be a flood of evidence? Yes. Will it all justify prosecution? No. Will some offenders be charged? We can’t say for sure, but it looks to us like the answer ought to be yes, and that’s true even if the final result is not a conviction. (That, after all, is why we have trials and juries.)

If federal officers understood that they could and might well be held liable for outrageous conduct, they might think twice before engaging in it. The ultimate goal is bringing to justice those who have engaged in blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional conduct. But what is needed immediately — urgently — is deterring such conduct from happening going forward. Federal officers who are wearing masks to obscure their faces (and those who aren’t) must understand that they will be held accountable if and when they break the law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26friedman-vladeck-lptc/26friedman-vladeck-lptc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:05.409662

“Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “Separately, a major investigation is going on with respect to the massive 20 Billion Dollar, Plus, Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organised protests going on in the streets.”

“Additionally, the DOJ and Congress are looking at ‘Congresswoman’ Illhan Omar, who left Somalia with NOTHING, and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars. Time will tell all.”

Omar’s net worth has increased into the millions of dollars in recent years due to her husband’s wealth. Omar serves in the US House of Representatives, representing Minnesota.

Omar responds

The congresswoman hit back at Trump, accusing him of invoking her to distract from his dwindling popularity.

“Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing, and you’re panicking,” Omar wrote on X.

“Right on cue, you’re deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me. Years of ‘investigations’ have found nothing. Get your goons out of Minnesota.”

Previously, Trump had publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to open investigations into his political opponents.

Last week, Trump said Omar “should be investigated for Financial and Political Crimes, and that investigation should start, NOW”.

Omar, who is of Somali descent, is one of Trump’s favourite targets, and he often deploys Islamophobic language to attack her.

The Muslim American congresswoman has been a vocal critic of Trump’s policies and rhetoric, including his attacks against the Somali community.

After Trump attacked Omar and called the Somali community “garbage” last month, Omar accused him of having a “creepy” obsession with her.

“I hope he gets the help he desperately needs,” she said at the time.

In recent months, Trump has been incessantly bringing up Omar and the Somali community, seizing on a COVID-19-era welfare embezzlement scandal in Minnesota in which dozens of people, including some Somali immigrants, have been charged.

Late last year, Trump mocked Omar’s headscarf in one of his rants over Minnesota and its Democratic Governor Tim Walz, saying she is “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.

At the same time, the Trump administration launched an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that appeared to be targeting the state’s sizeable Somali community.

But immigration officers’ aggressive tactics in the state have generated nationwide condemnation. Early this month, a federal officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen and a mother of three, as she tried to flee immigration agents who had surrounded her car.

The Trump administration accused her of trying to ram the officer, but video footage cast doubt over that claim.

Then came the killing of Pretti, who was shot multiple times after a tussle with immigration agents. The White House described the victim as a “domestic terrorist” and said he was carrying a gun.

But videos shot from multiple angles showed Pretti had a phone in one hand while their other hand was raised and empty before the shooting.

Trump speaks to Walz

The killings of both Good and Pretti took place in Minneapolis, part of which is represented by Omar.

“I am absolutely horrified that federal agents are targeting and executing our residents instead of protecting them,” the congresswoman said in a statement on Saturday.

She called on federal immigration officers to leave the city and for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be impeached.

Later on Monday, Trump said he spoke to Minnesota Governor Walz and the two “seemed to be on a similar wavelength”.

Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post on Sunday night comes as tensions escalate between anti-ICE protesters and federal immigration enforcement agents in the wake of over the weekend. Pretti is the second United States citizen to be killed by an ICE agent in Minnesota in just the past few weeks.

Trump blamed Democrat leadership, particularly Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for failing to “stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence,” which he said ultimately lead to the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good.

“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”

In a subsequent post, Trump made a list of demands on Democratic leadership including demanding Walz and Frey turn over all illegal aliens currently incarcerated, with an active warrant, or arrested by state and local law enforcement. He also requested that local police work with federal law enforcement “in apprehending and detaining Illegal Aliens who are wanted for Crimes.”

“Democrat Politicians must partner with the Federal Government to protect American Citizens in the rapid removal of all Criminal Illegal Aliens in our Country. Some Democrats, in places like Memphis, Tennessee, or Washington, D.C., have done so, resulting in safer streets for ALL,” Trump wrote.

Trump said all of his “requests are rooted in COMMON SENSE” and will ensure that Americans stay safe.

“The Trump Administration is standing by, and waiting for ANY Democrat to do the right thing, and work with us on these important matters of MAKING AMERICA SAFE like it is in all sections of our Country where we are, together with Local Leadership, participating and involved,” Trump wrote.

However, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CBS’ “Face The Nation” that “it’s not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement to hand folks over that are in jails.”

“The city police do not operate a jail that’s at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years,” O’Hara host Margaret Brennan on Sunday. “And I don’t know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.”",https://thenationaldesk.com/resources/media2/16x9/5590/986/0x292/90/67e70a87-f015-428b-8d15-6f922e0be3b6-GettyImages2257687936.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:59:05.690743

The surprise comments on social media by Trump after what he described as a ""very good call"" with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz could indicate a de-escalation of his immigration crackdown in the state.

Walz and other Democratic leaders have fiercely opposed the immigration surge, which they characterize as a lawless invasion that puts public safety at risk. Trump, for his part, has spent the past month accusing Walz of incompetence for failing to stop a welfare-fraud scandal in the state.

Walz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump earlier said he would dispatch the White House border czar, Tom Homan, to work with local officials following Saturday's shooting of a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, by immigration agents during a confrontation with protesters in Minneapolis. While other top Trump officials have characterized Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist,"" Homan has not publicly spoken about the incident.

In a statement, Trump said Homan ""has not been involved"" in the Minnesota crackdown ""but knows and likes many of the people there.""

Trump's statements came as state officials pressed a U.S. judge to temporarily stop the surge of 3,000 immigration agents.

""This administration, your honor, is not content with the rule of law. They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. Instead, they put violence into the streets of Minnesota to get what they want,"" Brian Carter, a lawyer with the state attorney general's office, told U.S. Judge Katherine Menendez.

JUDGE QUESTIONS WHETHER SHE HAS AUTHORITY TO STOP OPERATION

Menendez, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, appeared skeptical of the state's argument that she had the power to shut down the operation on the grounds that it violates the state's sovereignty.

“I don't know how you are asking me to identify when the federal government has crossed the line,"" she told Carter.

Menendez asked a Trump administration lawyer if the federal government was seeking to coerce the state into changing its immigration policies by sending thousands of agents to Minneapolis.

“Is the executive trying to achieve a goal through force that it cannot achieve through the courts?” Menendez asked Trump administration lawyer Brantley Mayers. Mayers answered with a no, saying the administration was there to enforce federal immigration law.

Menendez concluded the hearing after nearly three hours of argument. She did not say when she would rule.

The surge of agents has spurred massive street protests in below-freezing temperatures, and fierce condemnations by the state's Democratic leaders. Sixty of the state's largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and U.S. Bancorp, called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration on Sunday.

REPUBLICAN BREAKS WITH PARTY, DROPS GOVERNOR BID

A leading Republican candidate for governor, Chris Madel, dropped his bid on Monday, saying the crackdown had gone too far and had made the race unwinnable for a Republican.

""I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,"" he said in a video statement.

Homeland Security Department officials have described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun.

But video from the scene, verified by Reuters, contradicts that account. The footage shows Pretti holding a phone -- not a gun -- as agents wrestle him to the ground. It also shows officers removing a firearm stored near his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will remain in her job ""with the full trust and confidence of the President,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that his administration is ""reviewing everything"" about the incident and said immigration officials would eventually withdraw.

Recent Reuters polling indicates that a significant slice of Trump's Republican backers - 39% - , saying harm should be minimized even if this means fewer immigration-related arrests.

In Washington, Democrats in the Senate have said they will oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, raising the likelihood of a partial government shutdown starting on Sunday. Republicans approved a massive budget increase for immigration enforcement last year, but some of them now are demanding answers from the Trump administration.

Our children are American citizens.","A U.S. Navy veteran and father expresses fear for his adopted Latino children due to the current climate surrounding immigration.

The author argues that current immigration enforcement actions threaten constitutional protections and have led to documented deaths.

He contends that recent visa bans and suspensions have negatively impacted international adoptions, leaving families in limbo.

Citing his Christian faith, the author calls for compassion for immigrants, contrasting current policies with the teachings of Jesus.

I love this country. I served in the U.S. Navy because I believed in what America stood for.

Today, as a father of American children, I can no longer stay silent.

This is personal.

This is about the Constitution.

This is about faith.

I never imagined I would feel this afraid for my children in the United States of America.

Love adopted American children

My wife and I adopted our Latino children after the death of our son, Jimmy. Our children are American citizens. They are American kids. They are loved. They are innocent. And today, they are scared because of what they see, what they hear, and what they feel happening in this country.

If I am being honest, I am scared for them, too.

I love this country.

In my younger years, I was a Ronald Reagan Republican. President Reagan inspired me to serve in the Navy because I believed in what our country stood for.

Reagan understood that America could be both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. In 1986, he signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants who had lived and worked here for years.

Reagan believed in accountability, but he also believed in legalization and eventual citizenship for families who had put down roots. He was not for mass deportation of neighbors who came here to work and raise families.

We are supposed to be the good guys.

What we are witnessing today is different.

Deaths, constitutional issues arise

There have been documented deaths during immigration enforcement actions, including cases involving U.S. citizens, serious enough that international human rights officials have urged the United States to investigate and uphold the rule of law. That alone should alarm every American, regardless of political affiliation.

We are also seeing increasing threats to Fourth Amendment protections. Immigration agents are relying more frequently on administrative warrants that are not signed by judges to enter homes. Legal experts have raised serious concerns that this practice undermines constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. When constitutional safeguards are weakened for one group, they are weakened for all.

This issue is deeply personal for my family.

Recent visa bans and suspensions affecting certain countries have had real consequences for international adoption. When immigrant visas are barred or paused for nationals of specific countries, children adopted by U.S. citizens from those countries are often unable to receive the visas required to enter this country.

While these policies may not explicitly ban adoption, the practical effect is the same. Families are left in limbo. Children remain institutionalized. Loving homes are denied.

I believe violent criminals who are not citizens should be deported.

I do not believe in terrorizing families, targeting neighbors who were recruited here for labor or punishing children for circumstances beyond their control. For generations, our economy has depended on immigrant labor. To invite people in one era and discard them in another is not justice.

I am a follower of Christ, and my faith compels me to speak.

Jesus consistently aligned Himself with the vulnerable, the marginalized and the unpopular. Scripture is clear. We are commanded to love our neighbor as ourselves. We are commanded to welcome the foreigner and treat them as native born. Jesus taught that when we welcome the stranger, we welcome Him.

Christ did not fear foreigners. He protected the vulnerable. And when He saw exploitation masked as righteousness, He responded with righteous anger.

God, Constitution must guide actions

We are all God's children. Every one of us.

Citizen and non-citizen. Immigrant and native born. Adopted and biological. Black, brown and white.

We have a problem.

And the only way forward is together.

My children deserve to grow up in a country that honors the Constitution, protects families and lives up to its moral and spiritual commitments. Not one where fear replaces compassion and silence replaces courage.

We need to come together.

We need to stand up.

I can no longer stand by quietly.

Not as a father.

Not as an American.

Not as a Christian.","https://www.floridatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/PPHX/88355593007-202601251626021000-arizona-faith-network-prayer-vigil-outside-ice.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y0&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 15:06:38.376658

The move to send Homan, a career immigration agent who led ICE during the first Trump administration, suggests a shift in strategy. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has focused on raw numbers of deportations, placing Border Patrol at the helm of operations traditionally led by ICE.

Homan, meanwhile, has backed a more targeted approach to deportations focusing on detaining and removing unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.

It comes as public scrutiny has grown in the wake of the Saturday shooting of 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti by immigration officers in Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security and other top officials in the Trump administration rushed to blame Pretti for the shooting, arguing that Pretti was carrying a weapon and that officers were justified in using deadly force against Pretti. But videos circulating on social media do not show Pretti brandishing the weapon, and Pretti was also licensed to carry a weapon consistent with Minnesota law.

Trump distanced himself from the shooting in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. He said the administration is investigating the incident and declined to immediately say whether the officers followed protocol.

“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said.

Believe what we tell you, not your own eyes.

Once again, that is what the Trump administration is saying after another protester was shot and killed by federal immigration agents during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis.

It’s the second time in less than three weeks that federal agents killed a protester in Minneapolis. And for the second time, cellphone videos from bystanders on the scene appear to contradict the federal account of the killing.

On Jan. 7, Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet, was shot three times in the face and died as she drove past an ICE agent. The government claimed Good tried to use her car to ram the agent, and that the agent was reacting in self-defense. But videos of that shooting showed Good trying to turn away from the agent and flee the scene.

Then came more horrific events on Saturday.

Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was shot at least 10 times and died while being pinned to the ground by Border Patrol agents. The Department of Homeland Security said Pretti approached agents with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun” and was killed after they attempted to disarm him.

But just like Good’s killing, cellphone videos of the events were analyzed by news organizations, and the analysis did not line up with the government’s assessment.

The New York Times’ Devon Lum and Haley Willis wrote, “Footage shows Mr. Pretti was clearly holding a phone, not a gun, before the agents took him to the ground and shot him.”

The Times later added in that same analysis, “Several agents tussle with Mr. Pretti before bringing him to his knees. He appears to resist as the agents grab his legs, push down on his back and strike him repeatedly. The footage shows an agent approaching with empty hands and grabbing at Mr. Pretti as the others hold him down. About eight seconds after he is pinned, agents yell that he has a gun, indicating that they may not have known he was armed until he was on the ground.

The Times continues, “The same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a gun from among the group that appears to match the profile of a firearm DHS said belonged to Mr. Pretti. The agents appear to have him under their control, with his arms pinned near his head. As the gun emerges from the melee, another agent aims his own firearm at Mr. Pretti’s back and appears to fire one shot at close range. He then appears to continue firing at Mr. Pretti, who collapses. A third agent unholsters a weapon. Both agents appear to fire additional shots into Mr. Pretti as he lies motionless.”

The Associated Press’ Hannah Fingerhut wrote, “In the videos, Pretti is seen with only a phone in his hand. During the scuffle, ‘gun, gun’ is heard, and an officer appears to pull a handgun from Pretti’s waist area and begins moving away. As that happens, a first shot is fired by a Border Patrol officer. There’s a slight pause, and then the same officer fires several more times into Pretti’s back.”

Still, despite all the video evidence, many in the Trump administration placed the blame on Pretti.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and said he “brandished” a gun and intended to “kill law enforcement.” Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said, “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” FBI director Kash Patel said, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want. It’s that simple. You don’t have that right to break the law and incite violence.”

The Wall Street Journal, in its detailed video analysis, wrote, “Federal agents claimed Alex Pretti, 37, forced their hand, alleging he ‘violently resisted’ disarmament until the officers fired ‘defensive shots.’ Bystander footage appears to tell a different story. A frame-by-frame review by The Wall Street Journal shows a federal officer pulling a handgun away from Pretti. Less than a second later, an agent fires several rounds.”

Sunday morning fireworks

The Sunday morning shows featured some testy exchanges as many in the Trump administration seemed to justify the shooting of Pretti.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Kristen Welker pressed Department of Justice official Todd Blanche, who said, “This is not a peaceful protest. … He was not protesting peacefully.”

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino tangled with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Bovino has previously said Pretti was on the scene to “​​inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement.”

Bash told Bovino, “There’s no evidence that he was perpetrating violence! And there’s no evidence, unless you have it, and we’d love to see it if there is, that he was intending to massacre law enforcement, other than the fact that he was there and he had a gun lawfully.”

That led to a heated exchange with Bovino consistently insisting that Pretti was assaulting federal law enforcement.

At another point, while talking about video of the events, Bovino told Bash, “We’re not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze frame.”

Bash responded by saying, “It’s not a freeze frame. We’re showing a video of one of your agents taking the gun away. And that happened before Pretti was shot.

Then there was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent going at it with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on “This Week.” Bressent said at one point that Pretti’s mistake was bringing a gun instead of a billboard to a protest. To which Karl reminded Bessent of the Second Amendment.

Strong words

The editorial boards of The New York Times and The Washington Post both came out strongly against the Trump administration following the latest shooting in Minneapolis.

The Times board wrote, “The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.”

The Times board continued, “The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears.” And then later added, “Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.”

Meanwhile, the Post’s editorial board called Pretti’s killing “unjust” and added, “It’s essential that federal immigration officers don’t think they can act with impunity, because that will only encourage more fatal encounters. An independent probe of this shooting is an important step.”

The Post also wrote, “Most Americans want a secure border, and they think violent criminals should be deported. That’s a large part of why Trump returned to the White House. The overreach of the past year, however, could consume his presidency and lead to more tragedy. If Trump won’t change course on his own, can Republicans in Congress save him from himself?”

The Journal’s take

Meanwhile, the usually conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, “Time for ICE to Pause in Minneapolis.”

It wrote, “Pretti made a tragic mistake by interfering with ICE agents, but that warranted arrest, not a death sentence. The agents may say they felt threatened, but it’s worth noting the comments over the weekend by police around the country who say that this isn’t how they conduct law enforcement. Either many ICE agents aren’t properly trained, or they are so on edge as they face opposition in the streets that they are on a hair trigger. Either way, this calls for rethinking how ICE conducts itself, especially in Minneapolis as tensions build.”

The latest from Trump

Wall Street Journal reporter Josh Dawsey spoke with Trump on the phone for about five minutes on Sunday. Trump told Dawsey that his administration will review “everything” about the shooting.

Trump told Dawsey, “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”

Trump also indicated that ICE agents will leave Minnesota at some point. He told Dawsey, “At some point we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done a phenomenal job.”

Trump didn’t specify when that time might come.

Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” that Trump should consider removing ICE from Minnesota if there’s a “chance of losing more … innocent lives.”

Comer later said, “I’m like you and every other American. I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not. Yeah, I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”

Video tells the story

The one question that keeps cropping up in my mind is: What if no one had been filming what has happened in Minneapolis the past month? Yes, it can be infuriating to listen to those in the administration insist that what we are seeing with our own eyes isn’t what happened. But the videos — and the expert analysis performed by news organizations of those videos — do give us a clear picture of what our government is doing.

CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote, “Minnesota officials, sensing that residents feel relatively powerless amid the ICE surge in the state, have urged residents to bear witness, suggesting that the phones in their pockets are a form of power.”

Just last week, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in an address. “Carry your phone with you at all times. And if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take out that phone and hit record. Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans — not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

Following Saturday’s shooting, Walz said, “Thank God, thank God we have video.”

More notable Minneapolis coverage

The New York Times’ Peter Baker with “For Trump, the Truth in Minneapolis Is What He Says It Is.” Baker notes, “Mr. Trump has found that putting out a story line early and repeating it often can, with the help of an ideological media and online surround-sound machine, convince a sizable share of the public that does not credit contrary evidence. Even after investigations, recounts and his own advisers and attorney general refuted Mr. Trump’s claim that he won the 2020 election, polls show that most Republicans still believe the election was stolen. And so Mr. Trump and his team have taken the same reality-bending approach to the violence in Minneapolis in evident hopes of persuading the president’s political base, at least, that the protesters were responsible for their own deaths …”

The Minnesota Star Tribune has had superb coverage. Here’s Reid Forgrave and Sarah Ritter with “After latest Minneapolis shooting: Exhaustion, resilience and deepening fear.”

Andrew M. Luger, former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, writes in the Star Tribune: “No one in Minnesota asked for this.”

Post problems

Stunning and grim reporting is out about the state of affairs at The Washington Post.

First, The New York Times reported that the Post will not cover the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy — something that seems unfathomable for one of the most respected and legendary sports sections. Then, Puck’s Dylan Byers reported that massive layoffs are coming to the Post and tweeted, “rumor inside Post is that sports desk could be shuttered entirely… foreign desk will be hit hard too.” Byers added that the expectations are that “hundreds” will be affected.

First, the Olympics news.

In the past, the Post has sent 10 to 20 journalists to the Olympics. And this year, it asked for 14 credentials for the Winter Games, according to the Times. The Times’ Benjamin Mullin and Erik Wemple reported that Post managing editor Kimi Yoshino sent an email to more than a dozen of the Post’s journalists that said, “As we assess our priorities for 2026, we have decided not to send a contingent to the Winter Olympics. We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you, so please reach out to me if you want to talk further.”

What makes this note so shocking is that it comes less than two weeks before the Feb. 6 start of the Olympics. As the Times noted, “Many had already paid for their travel arrangements, according to two people familiar with their plans.”

The Times wrote, “According to the Post employee, the newspaper has already paid the vast majority of its expenses to cover the competition. Those include flights for the journalists, housing and office space at the Olympics site. Housing alone tallies at least $80,000, the employee said. Post management approved the outlays at each step along the way, according to the employee.”

USA Today columnist Christine Brennan, who was once the Olympics writer for the Post, tweeted, “This is just a stunning and awful development.”

Then there’s the Byers tweet talking about shutting down the Post sports section entirely, as well as cutting a major chunk from the foreign coverage. Sports and foreign coverage are two of the Post’s longtime staples. The Post sports section has been home to some of the most legendary sportswriters in the business: Shirley Povich, Tony Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon, Sally Jenkins, Thomas Boswell and the aforementioned Brennan, just to name a few.

The Post isn’t commenting, but it should be noted that Byers wrote that closing the sports desk is just a “rumor.” I still find it hard to believe the Post would take that step, but reports are that the layoffs will be substantial.

Meanwhile, Mullin and Wemple at the Times report that foreign correspondents at the Post have sent a letter — a “collective plea” — to Post owner Jeff Bezos about the rumors. Among the points made in the letter: “Robust, powerful foreign coverage is essential to the Washington Post’s brand and its future success in whatever form the paper takes moving forward.”

The letter also said, “Cutting this deeply sourced, battle-hardened and tireless staff would hinder The Post’s ability to respond to the biggest news developments on the horizon.”

The letter concludes by saying, “Jeff, we are endlessly grateful for your investment in our newspaper and longtime belief in our shared mission. At your first town hall in 2013, you told our newsroom, ‘You can be profitable and shrinking. And that’s a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.’ We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable.”

And Mullin tweeted Sunday afternoon, “I have been told that employees on The Washington Post foreign staff have been told explicitly that their jobs are at risk. There was also a directive barring reporters from going to high-risk zones as of Feb. 1, which some have taken as a precursor to cuts.”

And check out this tweet from longtime New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, “In my decades as a @nytimes foreign correspondent and then columnist, I’ve been regularly scooped and outshone by the brilliance of @washpost rivals. The WashPost foreign correspondents are a public good, and the world benefits from their work. I hope Jeff Bezos keeps them.”

Too far away

We now know which teams (New England and Seattle) will be in this year’s Super Bowl, but we also know who will not be at the big game: President Donald Trump. The president told the New York Post that he will not attend the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, California, because, “It’s just too far away.”

Now, it should be noted that U.S. presidents rarely attend the Super Bowl. In fact, a year ago, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. But to use the excuse that it’s “too far away” seems odd. I mean, isn’t the game being played in a country where Trump is president? The game is being played in California, not on Mars.

Trump also took the opportunity to slam the halftime show selections of Bad Bunny and Green Day, saying, “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”

The judges, representing appointees of nearly every president since Ronald Reagan, have grown increasingly alarmed by what they see as a pattern of defiance by the administration, shocking behavior by ICE and rampant targeting of people with no criminal history, despite Trump’s claim to be targeting “the worst of the worst.”

“Since November 2025, the courts of this District have thought of little else,” Judge Michael Davis said in a Sunday ruling criticizing the Trump administration’s “disingenuous” claim that one of his colleagues had given only a cursory review of its arguments. “It is a grave error to confuse efficiency with lack of rigor.”

The judges’ alarm has formed the backdrop to a broader clash between the Trump administration and Minnesota’s elected leaders, who have decried the operation that has led to the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents. Those deaths, followed by unproven claims and factually disputed accusations about the circumstances by Trump administration officials, have inflamed tensions across the nation and become the flashpoint in a larger battle for the identity of America.

Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Judges who are now weighing those larger cases have already seen their dockets swamped by individual immigration cases arising from Operation Metro Surge.

They include Kate Menendez, who recently ordered ICE to refrain from using retaliatory force against protesters. Her order was later blocked by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Biden-appointed judge is holding an even more significant hearing Monday, in the state’s effort to end Operation Metro Surge altogether.

“I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” Menendez said at the start of Monday’s hearing.

Menendez’s comment came just three days after she ordered the release of a Kenyan woman arrested while picking up seizure medication at a CVS, saying the administration lacked a legal basis to lock her up.

Another judge, Trump appointee Eric Tostrud, issued a restraining order on Saturday requiring the Trump administration to preserve evidence gathered from the scene of Alex Pretti’s shooting death. He is also weighing a class action lawsuit against racial profiling during the surge. Tostrud’s docket has been deluged with individual immigration cases for weeks, and he has ruled in every one of them that the administration had been illegally detaining people targeted for deportation without the opportunity for bond hearings.

The massive workload facing Minnesota judges may actually understate the impact of Operation Metro Surge: Department of Homeland Security officials have been quickly transferring some detainees out of state — often to deportation staging areas in Texas — which prevents them from filing for relief in Minnesota courts.

That was the case in another petition handled by Davis, who expressed shock at the administration’s treatment of a Burmese woman with three children, including a five-month-old baby, and a heart condition. The woman, who was admitted as a refugee in 2024, was abruptly moved to Texas after her Jan. 10 arrest. Davis ordered her return on Friday.

“There is simply no legal reason for keeping this mother 1800 miles away from her children,” the Clinton appointee said. “While the Court recognizes that many families are suffering due to … ICE actions in the District of Minnesota, there is something particularly craven about transferring a nursing refugee mother out-of-state.”

In a Saturday ruling, U.S. District Judge John Gerrard — a Nebraska-based judge helping Minnesota work through its crowded docket — ordered the release of a pregnant woman apprehended on her way to work, as well as her husband and two minor sons. The Trump administration signaled it was “attempting to locate” the family, and Gerrard gave them until Monday night to comply.

A second visiting judge, Missouri-based Stephen Bough, threatened contempt sanctions against the administration for sending a woman out of state despite his order to keep her in Minnesota.

The most common challenge raised by ICE’s targets is that they have been detained without due process — often arrested without a warrant and without the opportunity for bond hearings to remain released while deportation proceedings are pending. Judges across the country have overwhelmingly rejected the Trump administration’s bid to lock up nearly everyone it is targeting for deportation — a sharp break from every administration of the last 30 years, which prioritized detention only for those deemed dangerous or likely to flee.

A POLITICO analysis has identified 347 judges across the country who have rejected the administration’s detention policy — in more than 2,400 cases — while just 20 judges have sided with the administration, a small minority that has nevertheless grown in recent weeks. The emergency nature of the cases has so far stymied efforts to get appeals courts or the Supreme Court to weigh in on the policy, which has resulted in district courts’ dockets being clogged across the country. Hundreds of new emergency petitions for release are filed every day.

The judges in Minnesota are now bearing the brunt of the deluge. All but one — the Reagan-appointed Judge Paul Magnuson — have rejected the administration’s mass detention policy. And their frustrations are beginning to spill into the open more frequently.

Davis, in a third recently decided case, vented that the administration appeared not to be affording bond hearings to its targets — even after federal judges had ordered them.

“There has been an undeniable move by the Government in the past month to defy court orders or at least to stretch the legal process to the breaking point in an attempt to deny noncitizens their due process rights,” Davis wrote in a Sunday ruling. “With the evidence currently before the Court, it can only conclude that Respondents are attempting to ‘undermin[e] the regulatory and statutory authority of the immigration courts to coerce perpetual, infinite detention.’”

But it was the direct confrontation between the Trump administration and Minnesota’s chief federal judge, Patrick Schiltz, that laid bare the most obvious tensions. The George W. Bush appointee, in two Friday letters to the 8th Circuit, accused the administration of a “frivolous” bid to force the arrest of former CNN anchor Don Lemon and others linked to an anti-ICE demonstration at a St. Paul church.

“I am also dealing with a number of emergencies, including a lockdown at the Minneapolis courthouse because of protest activity, the defiance of several court orders by ICE, and the illegal detention of many detainees by ICE,” Schiltz wrote.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa7%2F6f%2Fcbb6ec2a4ebaa6e018c7e0c828a0%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2255793430,N,,2026-01-26 11:59:26.054865

Demonstrators brought signs and chanted against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration a day after 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday morning.

“It's good to see,” said Kathleen Devarenne, a protester. “I wish it were a lot more,” she said, referring to the turnout.

“I'm still worried,” she said.

The protest was organized by Kent County Indivisible. It’s the city’s latest anti-ICE demonstration, less than three weeks after the killing of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE agent, which spurred rallies across West Michigan.

Another protester, Jaylyn Gough, said she felt a need to make her voice heard.

“My thoughts and my prayers are with [Gough’s] family, and it's absolute murder,” said Gough. “As a Native woman, I often feel alone in this walk, and today, looking at all of this, I finally feel that I'm not alone.

“I think we're out here just to share and to show that people do not agree with what is happening right now,” she said. “We hope that this message gets to Minnesota, not only Minnesota, but everywhere across the country who is dealing with ICE.”

Devarenne hopes that the nationwide protests send a message to President Donald Trump.

“He needs to see that a good amount of the population does not support these terrible actions that don't follow due process and harm and kill innocent people,” she said. “I believe that our government has turned away from the Constitution.”

Some held signs expressing solidarity with Minnesota. Others reminded people of ICE’s presence in West Michigan.

“It's not just Minnesota,” said Devarenne. “We have a giant detention facility in Baldwin, I believe the largest in the Midwest.”

She referred to the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin.

Thousands of masked federal officers with uncertain authority are rampaging through the region, assaulting protesters and innocent people, abusing constitutional safeguards, staking out daycares and schools, snatching people off the streets in unmarked vans based on the color of their skin or their accent, and recklessly, relentlessly provoking violent confrontations with civilians—all against the loud, repeatedly expressed wishes of local and state officials.

Saturday morning, federal agents—apparently from the Border Patrol—shot and killed a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, amid a chaotic scuffle in front of a well-known Minneapolis donut store after agents began hassling and shoving him in the street. It was the second time this month that federal agents resorted to deadly force within mere seconds after initiating an encounter with a Minneapolis civilian who never posed a threat to agents.

All of this unnecessary violence raises the question: Why can’t elected officials do more to stop this? Apart from the courts, doesn’t Minnesota’s government have cards it can play in the battle against the Trump-led occupation, like calling out the National Guard for a showdown with federal agents?

The answer, in its shortest form, is mostly no, due to the basic foundations of American federalism. Over and over, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota governor Tim Walz have asked President Donald Trump to call back his operation. On Saturday, they again told the public that they had pleaded with the federal government to reconsider and withdraw the upwards of 3,000 immigration officers, who together nearly outnumber the region’s 10 largest state and local police departments combined.

But Walz and Frey haven’t taken overt actions to use state and local governments to actively resist because a key part of federalism in the United States is that a state can’t really resist federal authority or kick out federal law enforcement officials. That principle primarily exists because the federal government is meant to be the “protector” of last resort if local and state officials fail to uphold the rights of ordinary citizens. What’s remarkable, and worrisome, is that Trump today is using that arrangement to punish political opponents based on his own whims, as un-American an action as any president has ever undertaken and one that threatens the very union of the United States.

Tension in Minnesota between national officials and state and local elected officials is already sky high—and there’s rising animus between the federal forces and local law enforcement as well.

Minneapolis police were quick to condemn the shootings of both Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on January 7. They have also been vocal in recent days about how their own officers have been harassed and even assaulted by immigration agents while off-duty. (“Every one of [the off-duty officers stopped by immigration agents] is a person of color,” one police chief complained.) DHS agents tried to bar local police from the shooting scene on Saturday, forcing them to return with a court order, and this time FBI agents again apparently resisted allowing access. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” the head of the state’s investigation bureau said.

A governor also has the state's National Guard at their disposal, which could hypothetically be deployed to counter ICE's actions. Yesterday, Minnesota governor Tim Walz announced that he activated them following the shooting, amid a tense series of hours that saw the NBA postpone its evening game in Minneapolis for safety reasons. In a statement whose banality and simplicity underplayed just how stunning it was, the governor’s office said the guard was needed because “local law enforcement resources are stretched thin because of the disruption to public safety caused by thousands of federal immigration agents in our neighborhoods.” So far it seems like Walz’s intent is to use the National Guard and local and state police as more of a buffer between federal forces and Minnesota residents, rather than as a supplement to the street resistance efforts.

For now, state and local officials—like those who also suffered from heavy-handed immigration deployments last year, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and elsewhere—are primarily focused on using federal courts for relief. Overnight, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to ensure that federal officials didn’t destroy or alter evidence related to Saturday’s shooting. More broadly, Minnesota has a pending lawsuit aimed at blocking the immigration deployments altogether.

This restraint is almost certainly intended to prevent even further escalation, driven by President Trump’s apparent eagerness to declare Minnesota in a state of “insurrection” that would allow him to activate and deploy federal troops against its residents. Trump has already launched unprecedented criminal investigations against Walz and Frey, and others, in an apparent bid to create pretexts that could aid the use of the Insurrection Act.

The situation is so unprecedented—and the Trump administration’s political incentives so skewed by social media and the president’s own manias—that it’s impossible to understand or predict how the coming days and weeks might unfold. It’s especially unclear how state or local elected leaders might make the situation better for their constituents and neighbors—and, because of the Trump administration’s lawlessness, there are many paths where the situation worsens.

President Trump and his Department of Homeland Security in many ways appear to be attempting to provoke an actual showdown between federal forces and local or state authorities. DHS and White House officials have repeatedly labeled protesters exercising their First Amendment rights in Minnesota “domestic terrorists,” and they were quick to smear the victim of Saturday’s shooting; they shut down an investigation of the ICE officer who killed Renee Nicole Good earlier this month and ordered a federal investigation of Good and her spouse instead, leading to the resignation of the FBI agent assigned to the case; at least six federal prosecutors also resigned, refusing to participate in the attempt to scapegoat a victim.

In a deeply troubling development, ICE agents have started declaring that people who so much as record them are being entered into a national database as “domestic terrorists.” “Have fun with that,” an ICE officer in Maine was captured joking to a civilian filming him. (That the assault on Minneapolis has little to do with violent crime or immigration issues was underscored Saturday when attorney general Pam Bondi sent state officials a letter saying they’d withdraw the federal forces if Minnesota complied with a Trump request to turn over its voter rolls.)

While Walz and Frey’s seeming passivity in the face of an all-out federal attack on their constituents is provoking anger among activists, it may be a case where caution and restraint is the better part of valor. Citizens are already generating massive resistance to the federal presence in Minnesota, and any additional “official” resistance by local or state officials may tip the scales for Trump and bring federal troops into the picture, an escalation that would be surely worse for residents, the state, and the nation at large. Trump has already put some 1,500 federal troops in Alaska on standby to deploy to Minnesota, and all indications are that he’s eager for an excuse to do so.

Any such declaration of “insurrection” or deployment of federal troops to further subdue local and state authorities would bring the country the closest it’s been to civil war since, well, the Civil War.

A Brief History of Sending In the Troops

Under normal circumstances, the use of federal military forces in domestic situations is highly proscribed and limited by two sets of law, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878—which prohibits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement—and the Insurrection Act, a series of statutes that date to 1792 and outline when a president can call out troops to suppress rebellions and domestic violence.

Considering how critical a principle it guards, the Insurrection Act is badly antiquated, as recent reform efforts have shown. As national security legal scholar Scott Anderson wrote in 2024, “Few principles of American government are more foundational than the idea that the US military should not be used against Americans, except in the most dire of circumstances. But even fewer foundational principles are so loosely grounded in the law … The fact that past presidents have done so relatively rarely is more a product of long-standing political norms than hard legal limits.”

While state National Guard units and federal troops are routinely used to help respond to natural disasters at the request of and in coordination with local and state officials, since Reconstruction presidents have only reluctantly ever sent in federal agents or troops against the wishes of state governments. Even then, it’s in highly limited circumstances, such as defending civil rights and freedoms in moments when state officials refused to do so. (National Guard units usually report to state governors, although they can be federalized by presidential order to report to the commander-in-chief instead—meaning that Trump could always circumvent Walz activating them by putting them under direct Pentagon control anyway.)

In fact, while National Guard troops were used repeatedly in the 20th century by governors and presidents to break labor strikes—often brutally—it wasn’t until the Civil Rights movement and the 1960s that federal troops began to play a more routine role in responding to civil disturbances.

In 1957, when Arkansas governor Orval Faubus used the state’s National Guard to block the integration of Little Rock Central High School, President Dwight Eisenhower responded by federalizing all 10,000 Arkansas National Guardsmen and deploying troops from the 101st Airborne Division to force the school’s integration and protect the nine Black students attempting to enroll there. The mission was a key learning opportunity for the military, and when the Army manual on “Civil Disturbances” was republished in 1958, it had doubled in size and now contained a new section on riot control.

In every year of his short presidency, President John F. Kennedy deployed federal marshals or troops against the wishes of state officials as the civil rights movement gained momentum. In 1961, some 400 federal marshals were sent to Alabama to protect the Freedom Riders, and when James Meredith attempted to enroll as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962, Kennedy sent federal marshals who then faced incredibly violent white protesters.

With the marshals under attack, Kennedy deployed first the Mississippi National Guard and then thousands of federal troops as well. (That military operation, codenamed RAPID ROAD, was actually the first and only time during the Cold War that the military activated and used plans it had developed to quell civil disturbances in the wake of a nuclear attack.)

Then, in 1963, Kennedy again relied on the National Guard to help with the integration of the University of Alabama, and his successor, Lyndon Johnson, used marshals and the National Guard to protect civil rights marchers in Selma after Alabama state troopers infamously attacked them at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in an incident that came to be known as “Bloody Sunday.”

Presidents began using military troops, including the National Guard, more routinely in America’s cities in the 1960s. During summer riots following police brutality in Detroit in 1967, President Johnson ordered elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions into the city, and Michigan governor George Romney called up the Michigan National Guard; more than 40 people were killed, more than half by Detroit police. National Guard troops killed 11, including a 4-year-old girl, Tanya Blanding, who died when a Michigan guardsman opened fire with a tank-mounted .50-caliber machine gun on her apartment after wrongly believing a sniper was inside.

While troops were used again amid the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., the downside and risk of such deployments was vividly captured two years later at Kent State University when National Guard troops opened fire on students protesting the Vietnam War, killing four and wounding nine.

Over the years since, there has been incredibly limited domestic use of federal troops—the Los Angeles riots of 1992 being one exception—and presidents and attorneys general until the Trump administration usually go out of their way to coordinate surges of federal law enforcement to cities or states.

Even during the peak of the marshals and troop deployments to the South amid the Civil Rights movement, presidents only acted after state officials either refused to quell violence targeting Americans practicing their constitutional rights or, in the case of the Alabama state troopers, were the cause of the violence against peaceful citizens themselves. Often, a president acted only after there was defiance on the ground of a lawful court order—ensuring that there was a second branch of government acting as a check-and-balance and trigger for such federal action.

While Trump has said that the immigration enforcement effort in Minneapolis—as with previous efforts in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Charlotte, Portland and, most recently, Maine—is meant to enforce “law and order,” there’s no apparent rhyme, reason, or necessity to the deployments beyond political terror.

Trump today is attempting something unprecedented that stands in contravention of all historical tradition in the United States: the brutal application of federal forces against a state and region with no apparent reason beyond its being led by members of the political opposition.

In deploying immigration officers and border security agents from the DHS, rather than deputy US marshals from the Department of Justice—as presidents in the past have done—Trump is also changing the nature and tenor of his federal force. Marshals, whose work and training involves constitutional rights and protections, have always been used to protect civil rights and valid court orders and come with strong federal policing powers and authorities. The agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE are different. They are not trained to normal federal law enforcement standards of dealing with the public and are meant to operate with severely limited authority to enforce immigration matters, not general federal laws. CBP agents in particular are less a regular law enforcement agency, grounded in due process, and more a paramilitary force meant to operate on the border regions. They were never intended to have regular contact with US citizens and civilians.

Trump has also attempted to use troops in similar crackdowns over the last year and been stymied by federal courts, who, among other instances, preliminarily blocked his federalization of the California National Guard.","https://media.wired.com/photos/69763dfa2963322ff178d7bc/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/WIRED_ICE_GettyImages-2257462492.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 12:59:20.755676

JOHN HAMILTON: The next day, another Minnesotan would be killed, Alex Jeffrey Pretti.","AMY GOODMAN: We’re going to end with the tens of thousands of people who braved the bitter cold Friday demanding ”ICE out” of Minnesota. Democracy Now!’s John Hamilton was there.

PROTESTERS: ICE out! ICE out! ICE out! ICE out!

JOHN HAMILTON: It was 10 degrees below zero Fahrenheit when a crowd numbering in the tens of thousands marched through downtown Minneapolis Friday afternoon calling on ICE to get out of Minnesota. It was the largest single day of action so far in the ongoing standoff between local community and the Trump administration since ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agents, now numbering around 3,000, descended on Minnesota for Operation Metro Surge several weeks ago, bringing chaos, fear and violence.

JENNA SHERRICK: My name is Jenna Sherrick. I’m a local Minnesotan who grew up here my whole life. What’s going around is not OK, and we all need to be here to make a difference and say it’s not OK. When cruelty becomes reality, compassion becomes radical.

SARAH SHEA: Sarah Shea. I’m a Minnesotan. And I’m here to support our immigrant neighbors and our friends and families and people who are not deserving what’s going on right now. It’s outrageous. We’re frustrated. We’re angry. We’re everything. And we should all be out here supporting our neighbors and getting ICE out of our city. ICE out. And we protect us, because right now that is all us. It’s all community. We are the only ones out here doing it for each other.

PROTESTER: Standing back and not doing anything doesn’t help with, you know, the situation. Everybody’s scared. Everybody. So we need to speak out.

JOHN HAMILTON: The day of action was organized by clergy and labor leaders under the banner ”ICE Out: A Day of Truth and Freedom.” The Minnesota AFL-CIO, representing over a thousand unions across the state, endorsed the march, as well as many others. John Reuss is an English teacher with the Minnesota Federation of Educators.

JOHN REUSS: And we are here to shut it all down. All of us teachers, from Minneapolis to St. Paul, from all the way up from Duluth down to Rochester, we are all here in the middle of Minneapolis to shut it all down for our students and their families, and ICE out of our communities. Every teacher has so many stories right now.

But, you know, one, last week, I had a student who joined online during class, and in the middle of my lesson — I teach English — the student messaged me and said, ”ICE is outside of my house right now. What do I do?” And, you know, I stopped class right away. All the students heard what happened. And, you know, thank God his neighbors were out there outside of his house, and they chased ICE out of their neighborhood. Those agents had been circling his house all morning. And, you know, I think it’s really telling of our community, of our neighborhoods, how we’ve organized and how we are out there defending one another, including my student, who, thank God, he’s safe.

You know, the fear is so tangible. The fear is so tangible. This is our last option. We need to shut it all down. And so I am calling on every educator in this state, in this country, to shut it down, with Minneapolis, with St. Paul. You need to shut it all down with us, because if we do not shut it down right now, your city is next. And I do not — we do not want that to happen. We want to protect our students. We want our students back in schools. And the way we are going to get it is by shutting it down, to get ICE the hell out of here.

JOHN HAMILTON: Among those protesting were members of the Hmong American community, like Julie, whose family came to the United States decades ago as refugees after working alongside the U.S. in its secret war in Laos during the Vietnam War. She held a sign that read “Hmong Against ICE.”

JULIE: It’s scary, because they don’t — regardless of if you’re a citizen or not, they don’t ask. No question asked. They just assume that you’re illegal, that you’re a criminal. And it’s not fair for those of us people of color. My parents, they’re citizens. But we all live in fear. I’m a citizen, and I still live in fear every single day. And then, now my kids are in fear of, you know, going to school, because they have heard of stories of kids getting detained. And then, my kids, they’re scared of going to school. And we was promised safety. We was promised that, you know, we’ll get the freedom. But yet, today’s world, we are seeing that, you know, it’s getting revoked. Like, the United States are taking back the words. And the question is: Why? Why is it getting revoked? Why are we now being targeted as, you know, aliens, criminals? Some of us took off work, no school, no shopping, so we’re all out here against ICE.

JOHN HAMILTON: As demonstrators in the streets shut down parts of the Twin Cities, more than 700 businesses across the state closed their doors for what some called an economic blackout or general strike. Insight Brewing in Minneapolis was closed for business but stayed open for neighbors participating in the day of action. This is marketing manager Joey Steinbach.

JOEY STEINBACH: We are a space for our community, and our community is hurting right now. And the best way that we can help out is just direct-to-family donations. We’ve got a bunch of volunteers that are absolutely stellar. Outside of that, we’re just making some signs. We’re providing snacks, hand warmers, you know, just being a temporary third space while we’re not open for official business.

JOHN HAMILTON: Corporations that support or work with ICE were also targeted by demonstrators, like at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport —

PROTESTERS: Whose airport? Our airport! Whose airport? Our airport!

JOHN HAMILTON: — where demonstrators gathered to protest deportation flights.

PROTESTERS: Delta, Delta, you can’t hide! We can see your ICE-y side!

JOHN HAMILTON: The crowd of several hundred held signs that said “Business as usual doesn’t fly” and “Renee Good was good.” Among those who gathered were dozens of faith leaders. They shared stories of airport workers who had been arrested.

CLERGY MEMBER: We lift up Pedro, a janitor who helped his sister, who is unable to work, and was detained. He decided to self-deport because he could not take the conditions at the detention center in Texas.

JOHN HAMILTON: The union that represents airport workers reports at least 12 members have been arrested by ICE. Clergy then joined arms and sang, while others knelt and prayed, before police surrounded them, and at least a hundred were arrested.

PROTESTERS: For every one that you arrest, a thousand more will show up next!

JOHN HAMILTON: According to organizers, more than 70,000 people marched in Minneapolis Friday, and several thousand were in attendance at the Target Center for a rally. This is comedian and native Minnesotan, Lizz Winstead.

LIZZ WINSTEAD: And the untold thousands that are in this sport bowl facility, I am proud to call you neighbors. I do have to point out that we are in the Target Center, which may seem ironic, but remember, the Target Center is something our tax dollars pay for. So, chant it with me: Whose stadium?

CROWD: Our stadium!

LIZZ WINSTEAD: Whose stadium?

CROWD: Our stadium!

PROTESTERS: We are many! We are many! We are one! We are one!

JOHN HAMILTON: The venue is named after the retail giant based in Minnesota that activists have criticized for permitting ICE to operate on their property and to arrest employees without warrants.

LIZZ WINSTEAD: And when today is over, let’s commit to shopping at the businesses that stood with us, and make sure they can make it through these tough times, because the silence from the corporations in this state is deafening.

JOHN HAMILTON: Speaking at the rally, faith and labor leaders urged Minnesotans to continue to stand together. This is CWA President Claude Cummings.

CLAUDE CUMMINGS JR.: We stand in defiance of a wannabe dictator, and we will rise against the corporations and Trump’s billionaire buddies quietly funding his campaign to shred the Constitution. Political scientists and historians tell us, when countries have successfully prevented or reversed authoritarian control, unions have played an important role in stopping it. How do we do that? We stand shoulder to shoulder with our union siblings and with allies across the country. We do that when we join together and focus our attention directly on the corporations that enable fascism. Our unity across communities, organizations and unions is our power. And whatever we do, we must do it together.

JOHN HAMILTON: And they spoke of neighbors who had been lost to ICE violence. This is Rabbi Arielle Lekach-Rosenberg.

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: I want to lift up the names of two neighbors: Victor Manuel Díaz, abducted from his workplace in Minnesota on January 6th, who died in ICE custody in Texas on January 14th.

CROWD: Shame!

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: I want to lift up the name of Renee Macklin Good, queer poet, wife, parent, murdered in south Minneapolis by ICE on January 7th while observing an abduction in her neighborhood.

CROWD: Shame!

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: May their memories be for blessing. May their families be comforted and surrounded in love.

Videos of confrontations between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Minneapolis residents have flooded social media, showing some of the 3,000 officers who are deployed in the city stopping, questioning and detaining residents.

In one case, immigration agents escorted a U.S. citizen who is a grandfather of Hmong ancestry out of his house in his underwear in freezing weather. In another case, a father of a 5-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a U.S. citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a 5-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.

The events have sparked protests and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain you? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public versus a private space, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?

Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.

What rights do people have when approached by ICE?

Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone — including immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specializing in immigration cases.

The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.

For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions — such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest — require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the U.S. illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.

Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption,” said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed or would be committed.

Agents must meet an even higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause,” which generally requires enough evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.

What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?

Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.

In the 2025 case Noem v. Perdomo, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favor of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.

Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area,” Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile.”

Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling,” said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.

But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not co-signed by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility,” said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump v. Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?

The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.

“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as if an officer encounters a violent crime in progress, or someone needing medical care.

Securing a judicial warrant is time consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.

In the past, federal immigration officers typically would not forcibly enter homes if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE itself, without a judge’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.

Specific ICE officials have authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.

A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press reported Jan. 22.

The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo.”

The May 12, 2025, memo, signed by ICE acting director Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

If this policy were to be challenged in court, it’s unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.

What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?

If you believe that your rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, your options for suing for compensation are limited.

Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil lawsuits against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions, before tightening them again.

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICE_rights.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:00:00.887493

The big picture: Federal immigration agents have shot and killed two Minnesota citizens in recent weeks, inflaming local protests and a nationwide backlash against Trump's immigration enforcement tactics that have turned Minneapolis into a powder keg.

Driving the news: One federal judge will weigh whether the Trump administration's immigration surge is constitutional, and could ultimately halt it as state and local officials are requesting.

Another judge will hold a hearing in a case over state access to evidence surrounding the death of Pretti, the 37-year-old nurse whom a federal immigration agent shot and killed Saturday.

Catch up quick: Pretti's killing came after a federal agent fatally shot Renee Good weeks earlier.

The Trump administration demonized the victims in the aftermath, labeling them ""domestic terrorists."" They also allegedly restricted local and state agencies from investigating each incident, leading Minnesota officials to sue for access.

Here's what to know about the cases with hearings on Monday:

Twin Cities and state sue Trump administration

The state of Minnesota and lawyers for St. Paul and Minneapolis asked a judge to deem the federal immigration surge unconstitutional, according to a complaint filed earlier this month.

The lawsuit argues that the federal crackdown is infringing on state authority and amounts to coercion, which the state and cities argue is a violation of the Tenth Amendment.

""Defendants' actions force such an impermissible 'choice': use state and local law enforcement resources to carry out the federal government's civil immigration priorities or accept occupation by federal troops,"" the complaint reads.

As noted by The New York Times, the suit does not seek to end all immigration enforcement in the state but rather targets the ""unprecedented surge.""

The other side: The federal government slammed the state argument as ""absurdity"" and ""legally frivolous.""

They say the government's ""Operation Metro Surge"" has ""succeeded"" in seeing thousands arrested and is an exclusively federal mission to enforce federal law.

Expelling federal officers from the state, the administration argued, would be ""an unprecedented act of judicial overreach.""

What we're watching: U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, a Biden appointee, will hear arguments in the case Monday morning.

She is also overseeing a separate case filed by Minnesota demonstrators who accused agents of violating their rights. She imposed restrictions, but an appeals court blocked her injunction.

Worth noting: Those cases both predate the fatal shooting of Renee Good, but the legal fights have drawn more attention since then.

Feds barred from ""destroying"" evidence

Over the weekend, U.S. District Court Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the fatal shooting of Pretti.

At a Monday afternoon hearing, the government will have a chance to raise objections to that order.

What they're saying: Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Axios Sunday that any claim the government would destroy evidence is ""a ridiculous attempt to divide the American people and distract from the fact that our law enforcement officers were attacked.""

Yes, but: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already pledged a state investigation, blasting the federal government's accounts of Alex Pretti's final moments as false.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office asked in a complaint filed Saturday for the court to declare the feds' restriction of state access to evidence unconstitutional.

The White House reached out to Senate Democrats late Sunday, as have Republicans, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.

But they have not yet raised any realistic solutions, the aide said.

Republicans will need some Democratic support to pass the remaining spending bills in time to avoid a partial shutdown. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand.

On Sunday, House and Senate Democrats convened separate conference calls as they privately assess next steps and press to restrain the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

A deal begins to unravel

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee and key negotiator on the funding package, had been pushing her colleagues to vote for the homeland security bill, arguing that Democrats had successfully fought off major increases to the ICE budget.

But in the wake of the shooting, Murray said Sunday on X that ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray wrote.

Federal officials have defended the actions of the agents involved in the Good and Pretti shootings as justified. Democrats said video released of both shootings showed otherwise. Republicans are increasingly challenged, with some calling for thorough investigations while others stand with federal officials.

""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., posted on X. ""The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.""

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., wants a ""thorough and impartial investigation"" into the shooting and said ""any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said Democrats should reconsider their threat to not support DHS funding and work with him to ""end the mess created by sanctuary city policies.""

""Now is not the time to defund one of our major national security priorities: border protection,"" Graham said on X.

Funding puzzle will be hard to solve

The growing backlash from Democrats puts Republican leaders in the Senate in a difficult position.

Much of the government, including the Department of Defense, continues to operate on a short-term bill that provides funding only through Friday.

Republican leaders had hoped to avoid another shutdown after last fall's 43-day closure that revolved around Democrats' insistence on extending federal subsidies that make health coverage more affordable for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Before Pretti's death, many Democrats felt the same way about a potential shutdown, lending support in the House to most of the remaining appropriations bills — with DHS the exception.

House Democrats largely rejected the homeland security portion last week with just a handful joining Republicans to ensure its passage. More than 100 House Democrats called for Noem's impeachment.

The House sent the six funding bills to the Senate as a package, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to strip out the homeland security portion which Democrats are demanding.

Despite the procedural hurdles, Schumer said Sunday that Republicans should work with Democrats to advance the other five bills and rewrite the DHS bill. ""This is the best course of action, and the American people are on our side,"" Schumer said.

The path ahead is uncertain. The Senate is not scheduled to return to session until Tuesday, due to the snowstorm. The House plans to be out of session this week and would have to pass the funding package again if it is changed.

Democrats are pushing for policy changes to be added to the homeland security spending bill that would force ICE agents to use warrants for immigration arrests, mandate strengthened training, require agents to identify themselves and have Border Patrol agents stay on the border rather than assisting ICE with immigration raids in the interior of the country.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees homeland security funding, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that Congress cannot fund a department ""that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls across the country in violation of the law.""

One by one, Democrats stake out opposition

Democratic senators discussed the options on Sunday evening's call but without changes from Republicans, they appeared headed toward a shutdown. On the morning call with House Democrats, they heard from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison, both former congressmen.

Several other Democratic senators announced they would vote ""no"" on homeland security money, including some who had helped Republicans end the record shutdown last year.

WATCH: House approves final spending bills for the year

""The abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,"" Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said in a post on X. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., also said she opposes that portion of the package.

Minnesota's Democratic senators also indicated they will oppose the DHS funding bill.

""For those asking where we go from here: Not voting to fund ICE is a great place for us to start,"" Sen. Tina Smith wrote on X.

""We oppose the ICE funding bill. We call for a full and transparent investigation with state officials,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. ""And we call on our Republican colleagues to stand up. They know this is wrong.""

Why the entire government wouldn't shut down

The progress that Congress has made so far on spending bills means that much of the federal government's work would continue even if lawmakers are unable to complete the job.

A bill that Trump signed Friday funds the departments of Justice, Commerce and the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers through the end of the budget year in September.

The Department of Agriculture was funded from a previous measure, which means a shutdown shouldn't stop food assistance this time.

But other critical operations of the government would be disrupted.

But we have a role in local law enforcement,” she said.","If Arlington residents see immigration enforcement operating in the county, some local elected officials are advising them to call 911.

County Board Chair Matt de Ferranti and Board member Takis Karantonis encouraged calling the emergency number. De Ferranti noted at a meeting on Saturday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents “have no legal requirement to tell us when they come into our community.”

“It helps us know when ICE is in Arlington, so we can better pursue Arlington County’s law enforcement mission — preventing violence in our community,” he said.

De Ferranti argued that a lack of coordination with local law enforcement is part of a broader effort to sideline localities. He said he planned to bring forward, in coming weeks, “targeted and thoughtful” county resources for family members of those taken into custody or deported by the Trump administration.

“ICE’s approach is designed to provoke right now, and to seek out conflict,” he said.

At least 19 people have been removed from Arlington as part of ICE enforcement efforts, de Ferranti said. He opened the County Board meeting with discussion on this topic around 9:30 a.m., shortly before a federal immigration officer shot and killed a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis on Saturday morning.

There to speak on another matter during the public-comment period, retired Arlington County Police Department officer Gregg Kurasz said it would be better for residents to call the police non-emergency number — 703-558-2222 — rather than the emergency line.

“That would be more efficient” without losing time in getting a response, he said.

Karantonis disagreed.

“I would always call 911 when I see an ICE officer in my neighborhood — 911 is the best solution,” he said.

County Board member Susan Cunningham, meanwhile, suggested callers should use their best judgment when deciding which line to call.

“It goes to the same people. You just get queued a little differently,” she said.

Karantonis said the Trump administration seems intent on “converting law enforcement into a military intervention with all the trappings and appearance and posture of some sort of regime change.”

“This makes me very fearful,” Karantonis said, calling for “new innovative ways” to address the matter.

“I am not only fearful — I am afraid,” he said. “In a democracy, nobody should be afraid.”

Cunningham said it was important for the community to learn what role the county government can, and cannot, play in matters related to ICE efforts in Arlington.

“We cannot impede immigration activity. We cannot impede federal law enforcement. But we have a role in local law enforcement,” she said.",https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3045.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:59:53.116686

Immigration law creates a clear hierarchy of access to the United States. Most people who are not U.S. citizens do not have any right to set foot in the country. By contrast, U.S. citizens can come and go as they please. One rung below U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents – also known as green card holders – can come and go unless they’ve committed certain crimes.

This month, the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on the evidence that immigration officials need to treat permanent residents as if they are removable. In Bondi v. Lau, the justices are likely to consider whether border officials can rely on criminal charges alone to decide that permanent residents have committed an offense that can allow the government to remove them from the country.

Muk Choi Lau, a Chinese citizen, became a permanent resident of the United States in 2007. Almost five years later, New Jersey prosecutors charged him with trademark counterfeiting. While the criminal case against him was pending, Lau left the United States.

On his return, immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York decided that Lau should not be admitted into the United States – that is, authorized to enter and remain in the country indefinitely. Instead, the officer allowed Lau to proceed into the country under “parole,” a legal permission to enter the country for humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.

More than one year later, in 2013, Lau pleaded guilty to the criminal charges. The following year, immigration officials began legal proceedings to strip Lau of his green card and forcibly remove him from the United States.

Lau’s legal right to continue living in the United States hinges on the decision by the immigration officer at JFK Airport to deny Lau admission and instead parole him into the United States. Migrants who have been admitted into the United States can be deported if they are convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of their admission as a permanent resident. (Courts have described crimes of moral turpitude as “a nebulous concept,” but they have remained part of immigration law since 1891.)

The government claims that Lau’s conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude, but the passage of time – five years and 10 months – between his crime and his admission as a permanent resident means he would likely avoid deportation had he been admitted at JFK. By contrast, migrants who were paroled, rather than admitted, into the United States can be forcibly removed if they commit a crime involving moral turpitude at any time. Simply put, Lau’s conviction would not have affected his immigration status had he been admitted at JFK, but it spelled the beginning of his removal from the United States because he was paroled.

Challenging the government’s efforts to remove him, Lau argued that the immigration officer wrongly denied him admission. An immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals, the administrative unit within the Justice Department that hears appeals of decisions by immigration judges, disagreed with Lau. According to the BIA, federal immigration law permits an officer to deny admission and instead parole a permanent resident into the United States when a criminal prosecution is pending that, if it leads to a conviction, would permit immigration officials to bar a migrant’s entry.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit disagreed with the BIA. In a unanimous opinion for a three-judge panel, Judge Richard J. Sullivan concluded that Lau should have been admitted to the United States, rather than paroled. According to the court, the Immigration and Nationality Act clearly explains that permanent residents who are returning from abroad generally “shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States.” The presumption gives way only in the limited circumstances that Congress identified in the statute, including when a migrant “has committed” a crime involving moral turpitude.

The tricky part is agreeing on when immigration officials have enough evidence to know that someone has “committed” a crime that could lead to their exclusion from the United States. Assuming that trademark counterfeiting is a crime involving moral turpitude – a legal question that the 2nd Circuit did not decide – there is no question today, 12 years after Lau was convicted, that he would lose the presumption of reentry that Congress wrote into immigration law.

But when the immigration agent stationed at JFK denied Lau admission, Lau had not been convicted. Back then, federal officials could not be sure that he had committed the counterfeiting crime. At most, the immigration officer knew that prosecutors had accused Lau of committing the offense. Congress could have enacted a law allowing agents to exclude people based on nothing more than accusations of criminal activity, but that is not what Congress did. Instead, the law that Congress did enact requires more than the possibility that a migrant has committed a crime.

Building on an earlier BIA decision, the 2nd Circuit explained that immigration law requires “clear and convincing evidence” that the migrant committed the crime. Accusations alone fall short. As Judge Sullivan explained, “it will generally be difficult for DHS to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien has committed a qualifying crime at the time of admission if the admission precedes the LPR’s criminal trial or admission of guilt.”

Unlike the 2nd Circuit, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 5th and 9th Circuits have previously adopted positions that align with the government’s view. One traditional basis for the Supreme Court to add a case to its docket is to resolve a dispute among lower courts. Though the justices have not publicly explained their reason for intervening, it is likely that the division among the courts of appeals created by the 2nd Circuit’s opinion affected their decision.

When it comes, the court’s opinion will determine how much flexibility immigration officers have to impose consequences on migrants for committing crimes even before it is clear that they in fact committed a crime. The difference between a criminal prosecution and a conviction is important because many people are prosecuted but ultimately not convicted. Allowing immigration officials to act on nothing more than criminal charges that are pending means that migrants can more easily be barred from the United States based on criminal activity that criminal courts later find they did not commit. In a political climate in which immigration agents are adopting increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics, such broader latitude will certainly sweep more people into the immigration detention and deportation pipeline.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2238889106.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:00:10.082477

A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do – and left no way to address abuses.","Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into US cities, including Minneapolis, where agents have fatally shot two American citizen protesters in January.

Footage from bystanders of the two fatal shootings, including one by the border patrol that killed the ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.

Cameras worn by officers have long been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend of cameras for law enforcement. Officials in 2025 also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.

Darius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body-camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under the presidency of Joe Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.

In response to a request for comment, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities”.

At least three of the eight or more border patrol agents at the scene of Saturday’s shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.

When federal officers have engaged in acts of violence, including the fatal shootings of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on 7 January, top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations. Trump started ramping up immigration enforcement after Republicans in Congress passed a bill in the first year of his second presidency that provides $170bn for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and border patrol operate.

Pretti’s shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless it reins in immigration enforcement. US Customs and Border Protection – the border patrol’s parent agency – had 13,400 cameras for about 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.

ICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington DC.

While the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.

The proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.

The DHS says there are about 22,000 ICE officers, but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.

A homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives recently rejected that proposal, instead providing $20m for ICE and border patrol cameras.

Still, the bill – which now faces a challenging route to passage in the US Senate – did not require either agency to use the devices.

A top ICE official under Biden, Scott Shuchart, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations outside their normal operating area – an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.

The DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration placed about 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.

A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do – and left no way to address abuses.

In May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.

As of December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared with more than a hundred in March.

In 2023, the OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e2b8d4c140022d932f1df48413c0822dd93b26/188_0_1279_1023/master/1279.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=395254143212f7e6c9b1ba4ce80f48c8",N,,2026-01-26 09:58:09.160271

Democrats in the Senate are vowing to oppose a bill that would fund immigration enforcement, which could shut down the government.","Matthew Rose, an Opinion editorial director, hosted an online conversation with three Opinion columnists.

Matthew Rose: On Saturday, agents from the Border Patrol in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, an American citizen. We don’t have a full accounting of what happened, but the available video evidence shows he was filming the agents with his phone, as many locals have done since the full weight of federal immigration enforcement descended on the city.

Lydia, you’ve been to Minneapolis recently. Tell us what you saw and give us some context for what just happened.

Lydia Polgreen: I have never been a fan of the conceit of American journalists covering the United States as if it were a backwater foreign nation, but in Minneapolis last week I could not shake the impulse to compare my experiences in a city I know so well (I spent a chunk of my childhood in the Twin Cities, and my father is from Minneapolis) with my experiences covering civil wars in places like Congo, Sudan, Sri Lanka and more. Watching the video of Pretti’s killing, I thought: If this was happening on the streets of any of those places, I would not hesitate to call it an extrajudicial execution by security forces. This is where we are: armed agents of the state killing civilians with an apparent belief in their total impunity.

I left before Pretti was gunned down, apparently in the back while he was on his knees. What I saw was so reminiscent of other conflicts — civilians doing their very best to protect themselves and their neighbors from seemingly random violence meted out by state agents. Those agents, masked and heavily armed, are roaming the streets and picking up and assaulting people for having the wrong skin color or accent, or being engaged in the constitutionally protected acts of filming, observing or protesting their presence. Anyone who knows me knows that I am allergic to hyperbole, but sometimes you need to simply call a spade a spade. This is a lawless operation.

David French: We are witnessing the total breakdown of any meaningful system of accountability for federal officials. The combination of Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons, his ongoing campaign of pardoning friends and allies, his politicized prosecutions and now his administration’s assurances that federal officers have immunity are creating a new legal reality in the United States. The national government is becoming functionally lawless, and the legal system is struggling to contain his corruption.

We’re tasting the bitter fruit of Trump’s dreadful policies, to be sure, but it’s worse than that. He’s exploiting years of legal developments that have helped insulate federal officials from both criminal and civil accountability. It’s as if we engineered a legal system premised on the idea that federal officials are almost always honest, and the citizens who critique them are almost always wrong. We’ve tilted the legal playing field against citizens and in favor of the government.

The Trump administration breaks the law, and also ruthlessly exploits all the immunities it’s granted by law. The situation is unsustainable for a constitutional republic.

Michelle Goldberg: The administration is very consciously reinforcing that sense of impunity. First there was Stephen Miller addressing the security forces after one of them killed Renee Good: “To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.” On Sunday, Greg Bovino, the self-consciously villainous Border Patrol commander, praised the agents who executed Alex Pretti.

I wish people weren’t allowed to carry guns in public. But they are, and after watching Republicans bring semiautomatic weapons to protest Covid closures and make a hero of Kyle Rittenhouse. So it’s wild to hear Federal Bureau of Investigation head Kash Patel say, on Fox News, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want.” The point here isn’t hypocrisy; it’s them nakedly asserting that constitutional rights are for us, not you.

Rose: David, I wanted to pick up on your description of the federal government as lawless. As you’ve written, we seem to be in the world described by Nazi-era Jewish labor lawyer Ernst Fraenkel and what he called “the dual state.” There is one we live in, where we pay taxes and go to work, and life seems to work according to common rules, and the other where the rules no longer apply. Is this what we’re experiencing?

French: We’re living in a version of the dual state. Not to the same extent as the Nazis, of course, but Fraenkel’s framing is still relevant. The Nazis didn’t create their totalitarian state immediately. Instead, they were able to lull much of the population to sleep just by keeping their lives relatively normal. As you say, they went to work, paid their taxes, entered into contracts and did all the things you normally do in a functioning nation. But if you crossed the government, then you passed into a different state entirely, where you would feel the full weight of fascist power — regardless of the rule of law.

One of the saddest things about the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti is that you could tell that neither of them seemed to know the danger until it was too late. They believed they were operating in some version of the normal state (what Fraenkel called the “normative state”) where the police usually respond with discipline and restraint.

Good and Pretti both had calm demeanors. They may have been annoying federal officers, but nothing about their posture indicated the slightest threat. Good even said, “I’m not mad” to the man who would gun her down seconds later. Pretti was filming with his phone in one hand and he had the other hand in the air as he was pepper-sprayed and tackled.

The officers, however, were in that different state, what Fraenkel called the “prerogative state,” where the government is a law unto itself. The officers acted violently, with impunity, and the government immediately acted to defend them and slander their victims. As the prerogative state expands, the normative state shrinks, and our lives often change before we can grasp what happened.

Polgreen: For me, this is what makes the community response in Minnesota so heartening. We’ve seen an astonishing outpouring of action and support from ordinary citizens who have decided not to accept this dual state. They refuse to be lulled, and insist on their continued citizenship in the constitutionally governed United States.

One thing that has irked me is how so many call the people out on the streets in Minnesota protesters. Yes, they are motivated by an urge to protest what is happening in their communities, and yes, protesting is an important act of citizenship. But what I saw in Minneapolis is better described as organizing and concerted action. It is an important distinction because so much of what is happening is invisible — people engaging in a form of neighborhood watch, walking vulnerable kids to school to shield them from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Church groups organizing food parcels for families too afraid to leave home. Community groups using encrypted messaging to compile spreadsheets of suspected ICE vehicles and activity. Others are logging and archiving endless amounts of evidence of ICE atrocities. This is the product of deep community organizing, not merely spontaneous actions driven by immediate anger.

Goldberg: I agree with Lydia and it’s the one thing that saves me from despair. Jews were less than 1 percent of the population in Hitler’s Germany. Trump is at war with a plurality of his country.

I’d love to know what you both think about the possibility of civil war or some kind of crackup. David, you wrote a whole book about the danger of the United States splitting up. I have to say, if I could vote in a referendum tomorrow for a national divorce from MAGA strongholds, I’d do it in a heartbeat. This is one of those ideas that I’ve flirted with in the past but always discounted because it means betraying a lot of people who’d be stuck in Trumpistan, and because it’s hard to see how you’d draw lines when the split is urban vs. rural as much as red state vs. blue. But it feels untenable to be ruled perpetually by people who’d murder us in the street and then slander us for it.

I was struck by the secretary of defense posting “ICE > MN” on social media. These are not people who think they share any bonds of citizenship with Democrats. Obviously, the answer is to win elections. But we’ve seen how Trump’s movement responds to losing elections, and that was before Trump had repurposed ICE as a personal militia.

Polgreen: We may yet come to an actual civil war, with armed people on different sides. Already, you have the local police in an uneasy middle ground between civilians and federal agents. Things could get worse if we end up with a National Guard, deployed by Gov. Tim Walz, and federal troops, deployed by Trump, at odds over who has the authority to exercise the state’s monopoly on violence.

In a way, the Trump administration has already started a civil war in which a set of leaders and citizens are behaving in a manner loyal to the historical traditions of our Constitution, and a president who believes his word is law and has surrounded himself with loyalists ready to dispense with their constitutional duty and execute his dark vision.

Michelle’s suggestion of a kind of national divorce is seductive at moments like this, but Minnesota is in many ways an illustration of why union is the only solution. Yes, it is a resolutely blue state in presidential elections, but it is quite closely contested in state and congressional elections, with all the urban-rural, blue-and-white-collar divisions you suggest. I am struck at how we’ve seen almost no counteraction from the right in Minnesota, which suggests to me that even some of the MAGA factions within the state are taken aback by the federal incursion’s indiscriminate violence, and sense the great cost to their state should it continue for much longer.

French: I think I wrote my book too soon! It came out in September of 2020 — this was after the racial reckoning and many of the Covid protests, but before Jan. 6 and the chaos of Trump’s second term. My thesis was pretty simple — that every single significant cultural, political or religious trend was pulling us apart more than it was pushing us together. And if we can’t find a way to reverse these seismic forces we would risk our national union.

Lots of readers thought I might have been too alarmist, but everything is unfolding as I have feared. We don’t have to debate whether some kind of national divorce is imminent (I don’t think it is) to understand that enmity between red and blue is still growing, and that the more hatred permeates our society, the more unstable it becomes. We are creating the conditions for a catastrophe.

I desperately want to preserve this union, but even more than that I want to preserve the idea that this nation is and can be an instrument of liberty, justice and virtue. And that means vanquishing the forces of hate and division, not separating from them.

Rose: With immigration enforcement in Trump’s second term, we have a quasi-military force, backed by more funding than most countries give their actual militaries, deployed for the most part to enforce civil, not criminal law. Should we instead think about this as spectacle? Caitlin Dickerson of The Atlantic, interviewed by our colleague Ezra Klein, argued that immigration enforcement under Trump is being implemented for maximum visual impact.

Goldberg: That’s increasingly the critique of conservatives who don’t want to break with Trump, but also are having a hard time rationalizing ICE’s violence in Minneapolis. Erick Erickson blames what’s happening in Minnesota on the D.H.S. secretary, Kristi Noem, marginalizing Tom Homan, the border czar, in favor of Greg Bovino from Customs and Border Protection, who clearly relishes street-level confrontation.

And the administration obviously wants to make a spectacle. We don’t know why the guy who shot Renee Good was filming, but it could well have been to feed their insatiable demand for content, which in turn is feeding their recruiting efforts. Did any of you see the clip where one of agents shooting tear gas at protesters can be heard saying, “It’s like ‘Call of Duty.’ So cool, huh?”

I’m glad that some people on the right have at least concluded that this looks bad for their side, since it could create political pressure on Trump to pull back. At the same time, I don’t think you can divorce the policy from the spectacle. Both are meant to terrorize their enemies.

Polgreen: There is no question that spectacle is the goal here. Michelle just mentioned Bovino — he has been swanning about Minnesota in a long, green wool coat that lends him a distinctly fascist look. The way these officers are kitted out is nuts. Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, described it to me as “full battle rattle.” There is also a cartoonish aspect to the whole thing — social media is replete with videos of agents slipping on ice and falling, ass-over-teakettle, onto the frozen ground. You look at the videos of the shootings and there is an air of incompetence to the whole thing, even amid the horror. It is almost as if you can’t believe how amateurish and unprofessional these guys are.

Elliott Payne, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, told me about one encounter with an agent armed with a Taser. The guy held it sideways, like some kind of gangbanger, menacing Payne and other city officials as they tried to ask questions about why a man at a bus stop was being detained. Payne told me it was something out of a bad movie. No trained law enforcement officer would ever hold a weapon that way. It would be comical if it weren’t so utterly terrifying.

French: I think the administration has done a very effective job at convincing its supporters that enforcement might be messy, but the Democrats left them with no choice. This is what we have to do to protect our nation’s borders, deport criminal aliens, and preserve economic opportunity for Americans. It’s this, they argue, or you have open borders and complete chaos. I hear that sentiment all the time.

That’s a false choice. We can protect our border and enforce immigration laws without a violent, masked paramilitary force taking over our city streets. Presidents of both parties have deported millions of undocumented immigrants without resort to brutality and violence.

There are multiple purposes behind Trump’s aggression. He’s certainly trying to impress his supporters and intimidate his opponents. But he’s also trying to bait his opponents into extremism and violence in response. I’m afraid that he wants riots and a rerun of rhetoric like “defund the police.”

It is vitally important to respond to Trump’s extremism not with an opposing extreme, but rather with reason, good sense and peaceful, courageous conviction. Call his bluff. Show America that it’s not a binary choice between brutal enforcement or unrestrained immigration.

Rose: Recent polling suggests Americans don’t like ICE’s tactics, nor do they approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, but they still trust Republicans more than Democrats, generally, on the topic. Do any of you see an elected official of either party expressing anything akin to the French Theory of Immigration: Protect the border without the masked paramilitaries?

Goldberg: Isn’t this what basically every Democrat is saying? Even the people who are saying “abolish ICE” aren’t calling for an end to immigration enforcement. They’re arguing that this is a rogue agency beyond repair, and they’re right.

I understand why the “abolish ICE” debate has immediately become about polling and midterm politics. Democrats need to win, and they’re still stung by the backlash to “defund the police.” But before we debate messaging, I think we should talk about the substantive issue, which is that ICE, an organization that’s only 23 years old, has become a vehicle of state terror that must be disbanded.

One thing I learned from Ezra’s interview with Caitlin Dickerson is that most ICE agents have been hired in the past year. Many of them are people who responded to a recruitment drive that targeted gun shows, far-right influencers and overt white nationalists. They are showing every day that they are thuggish and unprofessional and regard many of their fellow citizens as their enemies. No politician should be so abject as to fund their own occupiers.

French: I like the idea of getting aggressive and specific in response. Take off their masks. End their immunities. Limit their jurisdiction. Restrain their tactics. All of this can be done through legislation without inhibiting humane immigration enforcement. And if it’s done correctly, legislative reform can lead to greater accountability across the whole of government.

Goldberg: David, do you really think the people who currently make up ICE are capable of humane immigration enforcement?

French: Some, yes and some, no. But you will make ICE infinitely less attractive to thugs and goons if they know they can be held immediately accountable, if they will never get to run around in their ridiculous military-style uniforms (cosplaying like they’re SEALs), and if they can’t break down doors or rappel from helicopters to check a person’s immigration status.

Goldberg: There’s a proposal in Maryland, the ICE Breaker Act, which would bar people hired by ICE under Trump from working in state law enforcement. I’d like to see similar efforts everywhere to increase the stigma of this work, even though the downside is redoubling their commitment to keeping Republicans in office.

French: Hmm. I’m not a fan. I think it’s a mistake to conclude that everyone who joins is nefarious. There are people who join, object to what they’re asked to do, and leave. Or blow the whistle and leave. I don’t want that person inhibited by a scarlet “I” for the rest of their professional life.

Also, Michelle, the downside you identify is pretty big. We don’t want even more people to believe that everything depends on the G.O.P. clinging to power.

Polgreen: David makes a really good point here — this is an emergency, but we do need to think about the future, and how we knit ourselves back together again. As someone who served in our Forever Wars, I am sure he knows many people who signed up for one mission out of patriotism and ended up with deep misgivings and regrets.

French: I absolutely do.

Polgreen: A lot of people in politics and punditry are overthinking this. It has been clear for a very long time that the general voting public wants a secure border and immigration reform. Anyone claiming that Americans voted for today’s insane policies is lying to themselves. I get frustrated with people who say stuff like, “This is not who we are,” because the United States has a long history of doing terrible things to its citizens and those who seek to make a home here. But I also get frustrated with people who argue that, “This is what America has always been,” because that, too, is fantasy.

The truth is that Americans are proud that their country is the destination of choice for the most ambitious and talented people in the world, and for anyone yearning for freedom under law. And I believe that fundamental to the American psyche is a belief that we are a nation built on a set of ideals, however imperfect our loyalty to those ideals.

Rose: You’ve touched on this already, but it’s worth pausing to consider what’s coming this week. Democrats in the Senate are vowing to oppose a bill that would fund immigration enforcement, which could shut down the government. What should they be asking for?

Goldberg: First and foremost, the withdrawal of ICE from Minneapolis.

Polgreen: I think this is the moment for Democrats to be quite ambitious. Michelle, I agree — ICE needs to leave Minnesota. There is simply no justification for this kind of deployment in a state with so few undocumented immigrants — as a proportion of its population it is less than half the national average.

At an absolute minimum, Democrats should demand an end to masking, a ban on military-style uniforms and a requirement that officers wear badges with identification. The feds must agree to independent investigations of uses of deadly force, and dispense with the fiction of immunity. I think Kristi Noem needs to go, but then whoever replaces her could be even worse.

I think it is quite disgusting that seven moderate Democrats in the House voted for this funding, including media darlings like Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Jared Golden of Maine. Democrats need to wake up and realize what time it is. This simply cannot stand.

French: I very much like the Lydia plan. No masks. No immunities. No military-style tactics or uniforms. You don’t need any of those things to protect the border and enforce immigration laws. And yes, end the Minneapolis operation. Now. Don’t make MAGA defend border enforcement. Make them defend the indefensible.

Rose: Two quick questions to finish. First, when people ask you what they can do, what’s your advice?

French: This is a crucial moment in American history. I think about it like this — when we learn about our family histories, we often ask what our ancestors were doing. Did they serve in World War II? Did they serve in Vietnam? Where did they stand during the civil rights movement?

This is a moment important enough that our grandchildren and even great-grandchildren might ask: “What did you know? What did you do?” Think hard about what you want your answer to be. Think hard about what you can do that will stand the test of time — whether it be peacefully protesting (including peaceful civil disobedience), volunteering for a political campaign, providing meals and clothing for immigrant families, or anything else that protects the vulnerable and defends human dignity.

One of the worst answers, however, would be to look a curious grandchild in the face, and say, “Well, I posted a lot on social media.”

Polgreen: I read so much about how we live in an atomized society, glued to our phones and social media but untethered from our communities and neighbors. Minnesota is demonstrating how quickly and fearlessly communities can come together in spite of the political and technological forces seeking to keep us divided. They also built on their past experience — many of these networks of support began during the George Floyd protests. Some were groups that wanted to march against the Minneapolis cops, and others wanted to protect neighborhoods from property damage. Now they have been reactivated to work together to help each other. A lot of us formed these kinds of networks during Covid. This would be a great time to reconnect with them. Be prepared to protect the people around you.

French: I love this emphasis on connection, Lydia.

Goldberg: Yeah, Lydia, I agree. There are a couple of women on my block — and I hope they won’t mind me referring to them — who are just phenomenal organizers, both politically and socially. One of them is the planner of the block party and the keeper of the free library; this morning I saw her out shoveling snow, not just in front of her own house but in front of those on either side of her. They’re also the ones who are handing out ICE whistles and holding weekly neighborhood meetings and protests.

I wrote in one of my columns that these anti-ICE actions are signs of local civic health. They come, ironically, out of the sort of deep local ties and resulting social trust that conservatives constantly say they want to recreate. So one thing you can do — depending on where you live, of course — is to meet your neighbors, and start talking to them about what you’re going to do if ICE descends.

Rose: And what have you seen that’s been heartening?

French: I’ll be completely honest. It’s a little harder for me to have hope when I know that the core political support for Trump’s aggression is coming from my own community. Without the lock step (and seemingly unconditional) support of so many millions of Evangelicals, Trump’s administration would crumble overnight. So I keep looking for signs of softening hearts and opening minds in Trump’s base — among the people who helped raise me, who taught me about faith, and who told me in no uncertain terms that politicians must demonstrate high character before they can earn your support. I feel a pervasive sadness about this moment.

That’s what is so grievous about civil strife. You often find yourself in opposition not to some hated, distant foe, but rather in opposition to people you’ve loved your whole life — whom you still love.

But there is hope. It’s a mistake to believe that the G.O.P. and its Christian supporters have crossed a Rubicon, never to return. And it’s a mistake to believe — even for the most hardhearted — that their aggression is a sign of their strength. They are masking weakness, and courage is their kryptonite.

Polgreen: I share David’s wariness of hope, which is very much warranted. Still, seeing the huge turnout in subzero temperatures on Friday in Minneapolis was incredibly moving. When I was in Minnesota, high school students in St. Paul staged a walkout and marched to the State Capitol. It was so very cold, but they came in their hundreds, an incredibly diverse group of kids.

I met a group of white teenage boys, the demographic supposedly lured in my Trump’s embrace of masculine cruelty. And they just weren’t having it. They talked about a kind of masculinity that involved sticking up for the vulnerable, being of service to your community, being a leader in your church and school. When I heard about Alex Pretti’s background — a boy scout, athlete, I.C.U. nurse caring for veterans — I instantly thought of those warm, kind Midwestern boys as his spiritual kin. That spirit lives on.

Goldberg: Watching ordinary people in Minneapolis stand up to ICE has filled me with an almost hokey degree of patriotism. It turns out there are still a lot of Americans with that deep instinct for associational life that Tocqueville wrote about. There is still, in much of this country, an instinctive hatred of tyrants, and a belief that people have the duty and agency to stand up to them. The past year has revealed that many of our elites, especially those in business and technology, are far more craven than I’d ever realized. But it also revealed a lot of everyday heroism.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/opinion/26minn-roundtable/26minn-roundtable-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:00:14.420674

By addressing these concerns, the U.S. can strive toward a more just approach to immigration enforcement.","ICE has deported roughly 540,000 people since Trump took office for his second presidential term in January 2025.

On January 7, 2026, an ICE agent killed an American citizen. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother living in Minneapolis, was shot to death in her vehicle by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Good’s death is now ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. Since an ICE agent committed the killing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office claimed exclusive federal jurisdiction and blocked Minnesota state officials from obtaining evidence.

On January 24, 2026, another American citizen was killed during an ICE operation. Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse also from Minneapolis, was shot to death in the street by a yet-unnamed agent. Federal authorities have described the shooting as an act of self-defense, but multiple videos of the encounter appear to conflict with that account, showing Pretti unarmed and being subdued at the time he was shot. This analysis is being published in the aftermath of the incident, while much about it is under investigation and still unknown.

Some people may call it ironic that the city where George Floyd was murdered is the same one where two white citizens were killed during protests against what others refer to as a hostile military government takeover. We call it, unfortunately, predictable. Many cities have seen ICE surges, including Washington, DC, Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, New Orleans, Brownsville, TX, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Minneapolis.

In several of these places, there are reports of ICE using excessive force, such as in the case of Julio Sosa-Celis, and of U.S. citizens being arrested or detained based on their accent or appearance, including Native Americans. This is also unfortunately predictable, as work from Brookings has identified how racial profiling by ICE would impact US citizens who are perceived to be immigrants from particular countries. The arrests of Ramon Menera and Chong Ly Thao are emblematic of this pattern.

On January 20, a 5-year-old with a pending asylum case was apprehended by ICE as he arrived home from preschool. School officials say he was used “as bait” to attempt to arrest other family members and members of his community.

Despite the Trump administration claiming they are targeting criminals, one-third of people arrested do not have a criminal record. In over 50 cases, ICE has allegedly busted out car windows to justify arrests. Overall, 32 people died while in ICE custody in 2025.

In response to ICE operations, Minneapolis and other cities have seen tens of thousands of protesters descend into the streets.

Absolute immunity, federal power, and echoes of the Civil Rights era

The Trump administration has argued for “absolute immunity” for ICE officers, which would lead to lawsuits being dismissed without the investigative discovery phase. The public feels differently: 60% of Americans believe ICE uses excessive force. Absolute immunity, compared to qualified immunity, protects agents regardless of whether they knowingly violate “clearly established” laws regarding excessive force or probable cause.

Sociologists and political scientists situate ICE’s actions as representing a crisis of legitimacy and a structural violence regime infiltrating the criminal justice system. What that means is that American streets have felt dystopian in ways that mirror less politically-stable countries. Police have taken a back seat in the headlines, though incidents of excessive force from law enforcement continue to occur (police killed over 1,300 people in 2025, despite local reforms to counter police violence and bias—a number that is higher than any year over the past decade, except for 2024).

We are also seeing Trump “federalize” the National Guard to support federal law enforcement operations as logistical support. This approach has been critiqued by some who view the Trump administration as being in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military as domestic law enforcement. In December 2025, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot use the National Guard for normal enforcement. Violence against National Guard members involved in domestic operations has also occurred, as in the case of Sarah Beckstrom, a member of the West Virginia National Guard, who was killed the day before Thanksgiving by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who also shot Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe in the head. Sgt. Wolfe recently started breathing on his own and standing with assistance.

Collectively, today’s images of law enforcement interactions with people living in the U.S. are reminiscent of an unstable Civil Rights movement period. But at that time, the National Guard and local police were doing the enforcement, not ICE. This is an important distinction that makes the current phase feel much different than prior eras of civil unrest. Sanchez, an author of this piece who has studied immigration and politics for decades, argues that the actions of ICE officers and statements from the Trump administration have radically shifted societal norms in ways that will have lasting consequences.

How ICE agents are being recruited today

ICE was formed in 2003 as part of a reorganization following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ICE is housed in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Different from local police, who report to mayors and county executives (or governors, in the case of state agencies), and the National Guard, who mostly report to governors as a military force, ICE is part of a federal agency where the president has more influence. While previous presidents have primarily deployed Border Patrol to enforce immigration violations at the border and used Homeland Security to investigate more severe criminal cases related to drug and human trafficking, President Trump has been much more likely to deploy the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Division within ICE to actively seek out people whom agents suspect of being illegal.

What makes this wave of ICE action different is how agents are being recruited and trained. With about $170 billion going to immigration enforcement and border security from Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” ICE has significantly expanded hiring. The agency is giving $50,000 signing bonuses and providing student loan forgiveness with the goal of doubling its workforce and meeting the president’s benchmark of deporting one million people annually. In doing so, ICE has lowered the age limit of its recruits from 21 to 18 and waived the 37-year-old hiring cap; these age boundaries apply to most federal law enforcement agencies to ensure the agents’ physical fitness. Since Trump retook office, ICE has hired over 12,000 new agents and expanded its headcount to over 22,000. However, there are reports of a decrease in rigor for selection: Investigative journalist Laura Jadeed reported attending an ICE career expo and being hired after six minutes without completing any background paperwork.

In her forthcoming book Cutting the Government: The Right Way and the Wrong Way, Brookings Senior Fellow Elaine Kamarck argues that ICE’s hiring and personnel protocols are further complicated by its heavy reliance on other agencies to carry out immigration enforcement. She notes a Cato Institute study finding that ICE receives assistance from nearly 17,000 non-ERO personnel (including roughly 14,500 federal criminal-law-enforcement officers), highlighting how immigration enforcement is diffused across multiple agencies. FBI agents are moved to assist ICE, which means that other functions, such as counterterrorism, have to be carried out with fewer people and resources. Agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have also been transferred to assist with deportations. The Trump administration has also shifted roughly 600 Department of Defense lawyers (with only two weeks of training) to address the massive immigration backlog from DHS.

Lower training standards

In addition to questionable hiring practices and leaving potential gaps in the nation’s other law enforcement needs, shortened training is problematic. The ICE Academy has been reduced from 22 weeks to 8 weeks or 47 days (a number supposedly chosen because Trump is the 47th president). The previously required 5 weeks of Spanish language training were removed, and agents are being told to rely on mobile apps for translation. Instead of a focus on understanding the Immigration and Nationality Act, trainees are engaging in more tactical and operational drills. Instead of a 4-week in-person training, police officers being deputized to work with ICE are now only required to do a 40-hour online course.

This watering down of hiring and training standards is concerning. Ray, the co-author of this article, has served on Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) commissions to help psychologists better evaluate police applicants for bias. One common trend over the past few years was that short-staffed police departments increasingly accepted applicants who would have been rejected in years prior. These hiring challenges raise, then, an urgent question: who are the new ICE recruits, and are their qualifications sufficient if they are receiving less training than before and yet being quickly deployed into U.S. communities? Ray has researched law enforcement for over 15 years, trained police officers, helped develop a virtual reality training program for law enforcement, and testified before Congress on policing. Simply put, training cannot be rushed and often should be increased.

The lack of training leads to mistakes. In law enforcement, mistakes get people killed.

Steps to reduce violence immediately

Accordingly, there are a series of measures that can be implemented immediately to reduce the use of force and improve decision-making.

First, hiring standards should be improved. ICE agents’ files should be cross-checked with state-level misconduct files. This aligns with Texas’s Wandering Officer Law to prevent people who were fired or resigned due to misconduct from working in law enforcement.

Second, training should be enhanced. De-escalation training, such as Jigsaw’s virtual reality training, can improve communication and decision-making in high-stakes situations. This training is mobile and can be easily deployed in various settings.

Third, Duty to Intervene should be mandated. Law enforcement agents, regardless of agency, should prevent a fellow officer or agent from using excessive force. This recommendation aligns with the Minneapolis Police Department’s cross-agency intervention policy.

Fourth, transparency must improve. Agents should use body-worn cameras and official vehicles with insignia, and masks that cover the faces of agents should not be allowed. This recommendation aligns with laws requiring that agents “unmask” or “de-mask,” with the assumption that more transparency will lead to reduced use of force.

Fifth, absolute immunity should be removed, and investigations into instances of wrongdoing by federal agents should be pursued.

There are other proposals and decisions of note that are aiming to address actions by ICE:

Lawmakers are already discussing reforms that include some of the recommendations mentioned above, such as requiring agents to provide first aid (when Good was killed, ICE agents did not allow a physician at the scene to render aid) or prohibiting provisional hiring without a complete background check.

A Minnesota federal judge restricted ICE’s use of retaliation against peaceful protesters. Some readers may be thinking: Isn’t this already the law? Well, this is the point. The legal and cultural norms that most Americans assumed were cemented into our democratic culture have been so upended that judges have to restate the basics of constitutional protest rights.

Maryland is discussing measures to prohibit people who join ICE from obtaining law enforcement jobs in the state. Critics argue that employees working for the federal government cannot be discriminated against when pursuing employment.

Finally, the DHS appropriation bill that Congress aims to pass by the end of January would require DHS to spend $20 million on body cameras for immigration enforcement agents and direct the department to expand training on conflict de-escalation during public interactions. In the aftermath of Pretti’s killing, a growing number of Democratic senators have announced that they will not support the bill,

Altogether, as ICE continues to face allegations over its methods, fostering a system built on fairness and respect for human rights becomes paramount. By addressing these concerns, the U.S. can strive toward a more just approach to immigration enforcement.

Ultimately, the goal should be to safeguard two things at the same time: national security, and the dignity and rights of every individual within our borders.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256086780-2.jpg?quality=75,N,,2026-01-26 09:58:17.907868

The lawlessness of ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies has been increasing – and been increasingly blatant – for the last year.","What we are seeing in Minneapolis right now is horrendous, frightening, and heartbreaking. But it is not a surprise. Over the past year, the Trump administration has deliberately escalated immigration enforcement - expanding funding and capacity for ICE, normalising violent and racist rhetoric, and expanding legal support for immigration enforcement while stripping back oversight. On the ground, federal immigration agents have grown bolder and more aggressive.

Where we are now traces directly back to the very beginning of Trump’s second term. In this post I trace out the actions since January 2025, highlighting the key events that tell the story of how we ended up here.

Below is a chart of actions over the last year – I’ve logged almost 200 and so have only been able to label the most significant on the chart below (high resolution version). The full list, along with links to relevant news stories, can be accessed here.

The first nine months: removing guardrails, increasing funding, desensitising the population

On his first day in office, Trump signed a Proclamation titled “Guaranteeing The States Protection Against Invasion”. This classified southern border crossings as an “invasion” and authorised the Department for Homeland Security (DHS), under which ICE sits, to take “all appropriate action” to “repel, repatriate, or remove” people deemed part of that invasion. Two days later, DHS signed an additional memo authorising ICE agents to expel 1.4 million immigrants who had been allowed to remain under Biden-era policies. The scene was set for the mass deportation efforts to follow.

In March 2025, three watchdogs agencies within DHS were shut down removing important oversight of ICE activities. DHS started deporting Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador’s notorious prison CECOT without due process. By Spring, ICE is arresting people as they turn up for their immigration hearings, wrongly arrests US citizens, all while reports of human rights abuses in detention facilities increase. In May 2025, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrongly asserts that the president has “a constitutional right” to deport people without due process.

In terms of building capacity, Trump increased ICE’s budget by $70 billion over four years, a six-fold increase. The American Immigration Council called this “a fundamental reshaping of American society” and said that ICE “would become more powerful than every other federal law enforcement agency”. ICE also started to ramp up its surveillance technologies, with facial recognition apps, spyware, and sharing of sensitive federal data, while some paperwork requirements for arrests were scrapped and funding for bodycams cut. Meanwhile, ICE started a recruitment drive, offering signing-on bonuses and lowering entry requirements.

June saw the National Guard and marines deployed to Los Angeles, followed by DC. Concentrated ICE and Border Patrol deployments targeted LA, Portland, DC, Memphis, New York and Chicago over the summer and early autumn. The National Guard in DC go from being unarmed, to being “maybe armed”, to all being armed. The Department for Homeland Security (DHS) refuses to comply with state rules on identification, and agents continue to detain people while wearing face masks and plain clothes and using unmarked cars.

Dissent is legislated against and punished. In late August, Trump signs an Executive Order to establish specialised National Guard units to address “public order issues”. The next day, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, calls the Democrat Party “a domestic extremist organization” for opposing deployment of the National Guard in DC. US politicians are arrested for demanding access to ICE facilities in New York and DHS threatens federal assault charges against anyone ‘attacking’ ICE agents. In mid September, ICE agents kill a man in a Chicago while trying to arrest him – and are later shown to have lied about what happened.

I believe that the summer gave the administration the reassurance it needed so that it could escalate ICE tactics. While there had been many civilian protests against ICE and National Guard deployment, and many successful legal challenges, Congress did not step in, Fox News and the MAGA base stayed onside. It was safe to continue.

An autumn of increasing brutality, lawlessness and violent rhetoric

By early October, Trump had called Portland, Oregon “war-ravaged” and authorised “full force” against anyone ‘threatening’ ICE facilities. A few days later, Trump suggested that the military could use “dangerous cities” as “training grounds”. ICE had spent more than $70m on new weapons in 2025 and at least 16 deaths of detainees held in ICE facilities had been recorded since January.

In late October, Stephen Miller said anyone interfering in ICE operations could be arrested for engaging in “criminal conspiracy” against the US. Trump said he’s prepared to send “more than the National Guard” into American cities and the Pentagon ordered states’ National Guard units to form “quick reaction forces” for “crowd control”. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) increasingly painted opponents to ICE activity as “domestic terrorists” and as “lawless”.

In early November, a US citizen is shot (but not killed) from behind by ICE agents. The only consequence is that ICE is trying to prosecute him for “assault”, alleging he tried to run them over. The latest ICE operation – this time targeting Minnesota – is announced on 2 December.

Recruitment drives for ICE continue into winter, the Southern border is increasingly militarised, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is providing passenger lists to immigration enforcement. By Christmas, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserts (wrongly) that recording or following ICE agents is “obstruction of justice”, despite it being protected free speech. This argument will be repeatedly used to justify violence against – and the killing of – observers and protesters in January.

January – Minnesota becomes the test case for military takeover of a US city by ICE and other federal immigration agents.

The first few weeks of 2026 have seen Minneapolis at the centre of the deportation effort – and of lawful protest and observation. ICE agents have been testing the limits of what they can get away with. So far, the administration has protected and even celebrated their violence.

On 7 January 2026, US citizen Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agents, while trying to get out of their way. The administration immediately characterised her as a “domestic terrorist” who was trying to run over and kill the agents. Video directly contradicted this account. An autopsy released by her family showed that the first two bullets were not life-threatening, but the third killed her – when an ICE agent leaned into the driver’s side window and shot her in the head at close range. JD Vance said afterwards that ICE agents had “absolute immunity” (a claim he has later walked back). The investigation was taken over by the central FBI, with local law enforcement excluded. A civil rights case opened to investigate her shooting was altered to be an investigation of Renee Good for “criminal activity” (and later thrown out by a judge). Good’s widowed wife is being investigated as a potential terrorist. The Department of Justice has now confirmed it sees no need to investigate Good’s death.

Since then, DHS promised to send another 1,000 agents to Minnesota. Federal immigration agents in Minnesota have been filmed breaking into a US citizen’s house and dragging him out in his underwear in subzero temperatures; arresting a 5-year old boy on his way home from school and then his dad (both are still in custody); pepper spraying an observer directly in the face while restraining them on the ground; pepper spraying the Minnesota Attorney General at close range; and deploying tear gas against a family of six in their car, resulting in their baby needing hospital. And those are just a fraction of the stories.

The administration has leaned into white supremacist imagery and defence of ICE. Trump threatened to invoke the insurrection act in Minnesota, with 1,500 troops reported to be on standby in Alaska. Civil rights and the rule of law were further weakened. Kristi Noem said ICE was allowed to ask citizens for their citizenship papers. Minnesota’s governor, attorney general, and Minneapolis’ mayor have all been targeted for judicial investigation into ‘obstruction’ of ICE activities.

Elsewhere, a Cuban immigrant was killed in detention while being held in a chokehold by staff. A new ICE operation began in Maine, explicitly targeting Somali immigrants.

And then, on Saturday, federal immigration agents restrained, then killed, US citizen Alex Pretti, who was helping a fellow protester in Minneapolis after she was pushed to the ground by agents. They sprayed him in the face with pepper spray, wrestled him to the ground, and then fatally shot him multiple times. It was witnessed and multiple videos exist showing the shooting from different angles.

The administration has repeatedly lied about what happened, falsely asserting that Pretti was threatening agents and attempting to shoot them, while local police say that the Department of Homeland Security is taking control of the investigation and blocking their access to evidence. Trump, Hegseth, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller have all backed ICE and Border Patrol.

On thin ICE?

The lawlessness of ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies has been increasing – and been increasingly blatant – for the last year. So far, the administration has covered for them, celebrated them, enabled them, and funded them. Minnesotans have shown how concerted and coordinated local action can make a difference and the crucial importance of witnessing, and recording, what is happening.

Calls are growing, including from former President Obama, for proper investigations and an end to ICE’s deliberate brutality in Democrat cities. Some Republicans are also now speaking up, calling for investigations and questioning the immigration crackdown.

Will Trump and his team listen? If they don’t, will a Republican-led Congress finally assert its authority through legislation, hearings, appropriations powers and even impeachment? Because if there are no consequences to the violence we are witnessing, then it will keep spreading. That is what unchecked power does.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!INO9!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55cc5709-8454-4ee0-83b9-7d0ad30a07f6_6042x3692.png",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:18.342515

Based on what you know, was the shooting of the man in Minneapolis justified or not justified?","After federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a Minneapolis resident for the second time this month, more Americans now say they would support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) than say they would oppose eliminating the agency. A majority of Americans say ICE's tactics are too forceful and about half say they strongly disapprove of the way the agency is handling its job, according to a YouGov Poll conducted hours after the shooting. More Americans approve than disapprove of protests against ICE. Because the poll was conducted so soon after the shooting in Minneapolis, some respondents who were not aware of the news when they answered the questions might hear about it in subsequent days.

Another poll conducted the day after the shooting found that about half of Americans say the shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti was not justified, while only 20% said it was justified. The gap is even larger among Americans who have seen video of the shooting, nearly two-thirds of whom say it was not justified. While ICE has been the subject of protests since the first killing in Minneapolis — of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross — the shooter in this case worked for the Border Patrol, another agency in the Department of Homeland Security that was supporting ICE's operations in the city. Americans' opinions toward the Border Patrol are not as negative as views of ICE, though Americans who have seen video of the killing are more likely to have an unfavorable than a favorable opinion of the Border Patrol.

These latest results show an increase in opposition to ICE compared to two YouGov polls fielded earlier in January after the killing of Good. At that point, support for abolishing ICE was already at the highest level ever observed in YouGov polls.

Opposition to ICE has grown in January

More Americans support than oppose abolishing ICE (46% vs. 41%). This marks a slight increase from earlier this month, when three YouGov polls found that the share of Americans who supported eliminating ICE as a federal agency was roughly equal to the share who opposed it: 46% to 43% in one poll, 42% vs. 45% in another, and 45% vs. 45% in a third.

Democrats overwhelmingly support eliminating ICE (76% vs. 15%), as do nearly half of Independents (47% vs. 35%). Most Republicans (73%) continue to oppose abolishing ICE. Only 19% of Republicans support eliminating the agency, but that's a higher level than in any of the polls from earlier this month.

A majority (57%) of Americans somewhat or strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. Only 37% approve. Among Americans who have strong opinions about ICE, the divide is even starker. About half (48%) of Americans strongly disapprove, twice as many as the share who strongly approve: about one-quarter (23%).

Majorities of Democrats (83%) and Independents (54%) strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. In contrast, about half (51%) of Republicans strongly approve of ICE's job handling and only 7% strongly disapprove.

Views of ICE's tactics may contribute to the growing disapproval of the agency. A majority (58%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. That's a 5-percentage-point increase from earlier this month, when 53% said ICE was too forceful. Today, only 23% of Americans say that ICE's tactics are about right and 10% say they are not forceful enough.

Most Democrats (90%) and Independents (62%) say that ICE is too forceful. Republicans are much more likely to say that ICE's tactics are about right (49%). The remaining Republicans are about evenly split between saying ICE is too forceful and saying that it is not forceful enough (22% vs. 21%). Very few Democrats or Independents say that ICE is not forceful enough.

About half (49%) of Americans somewhat or strongly approve of protests against ICE actions, compared to 41% who disapprove. Most Democrats (79%) approve of such protests. Independents are more likely to approve than disapprove of them (49% vs. 35%). In contrast, only 20% of Republicans approve of protests against ICE, while 71% disapprove. Support for protests against ICE is essentially unchanged from earlier in January.

Few Americans think the shooting of Alex Pretti was justified

About half (48%) of Americans say the shooting of Pretti on Saturday in Minneapolis was not justified, while only 20% say it was justified. The gap is even larger among the majority (58%) of Americans who have seen video of the shooting. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of those who have seen video of the shooting say it was not justified, compared to just one-quarter (25%) who say it was not justified. This is similar to the results of an experiment conducted by YouGov with the Economist after the first shooting in Minneapolis: People who were shown a video of the shooting were more likely to say it was not justified. It also may reflect that more Democrats than Republicans have seen video of the shooting.

Democrats overwhelmingly say the shooting was not justified (83%), as do half of Independents (50%, compared to 13% who say it was justified). Republicans are much more likely to say the shooting was justified. The share of Republicans who say the shooting was justified (44%) is about the same as the share who say they're not sure if it was justified (43%). Few Republicans (13%) say the shooting was not justified.

Americans are slightly more likely to express favorable than unfavorable opinions of the Border Patrol (45% vs. 42%), the agency whose officer killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday. This can largely be attributed to Republicans' extremely positive evaluations of the agency: 83% of Republicans view the agency favorably, while only 7% have unfavorable opinions. In contrast, Independents are more likely to view the Border Patrol unfavorably than to view it favorably (48% vs. 34%) and most Democrats (73%) have unfavorable opinions of the agency while only 17% view it favorably.

Americans who have seen video of Saturday's shooting are much more likely to express negative views of the Border Patrol: A majority (53%) of Americans who have seen video of the shooting have an unfavorable opinion of the Border Patrol, compared to 41% who view the agency favorably. On the other hand, 52% of Americans who have not seen video of the shooting have a favorable opinion of the Border Patrol, while only 31% express an unfavorable opinion of the agency.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge will hear arguments Monday on whether she should at least temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that has led to the fatal shootings of two people by government officers.

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Saturday's shooting by a Border Patrol officer of Alex Pretti has only added urgency to the case.

Since the original filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request. They're trying to restore the state of affairs that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

The hearing is set for Monday morning in federal court in Minneapolis. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he plans to personally attend.

They're asking that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Menendez order federal law enforcement agencies to reduce the numbers of officers and agents in Minnesota to levels before the surge, while allowing them to continue to enforce immigration laws within a long list of proposed limits.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit “legally frivolous” and said ""Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement.” They asked the judge to reject the request or or at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Ellison said at a news conference Sunday that he and the cities filed their lawsuit because of “the unprecedented nature of this of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we’re looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we’ve seen something like this.”

It wasn't clear ahead of the hearing when the judge might rule.

The case also has implications for other states that have been or could be targets of intensive federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,” the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez is the same judge who ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who aren’t obstructing authorities, including people who are following and observing agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday’s shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing. The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, late Saturday issued an order blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

The organisation warned that the United States risked becoming a “model for strongmen” and “a warning rather than an inspiration”, while stressing that its protest was in solidarity with the American people.

The gathering will take place at 6:30pm.

In an open letter to Farkas, who recently took up her post, Repubblika said it had “followed with horror the growing number of deaths associated with immigration enforcement and detention” in the United States, referring to what it described as “murders and cruel atrocities currently being committed in America under the guise of enforcing immigration laws”.

The organisation said there were “credible reports of systemic abuse, medical neglect and excessive use of force”, stressing that these were “not isolated incidents”, and highlighted what it called the “distressing” treatment of minors by immigration authorities.

The NGO’s intervention follows the fatal shooting of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis over the weekend, the second recent ICE-related fatal shooting in the city, as well as reports that a five-year-old boy was detained while returning home from school. Repubblika said US human rights and civil society organisations had described the incidents as “cruel, disproportionate and incompatible with the rule of law”, warning that federal methods were beginning to resemble those of authoritarian regimes.

Repubblika also referred to recent public comments by Farkas, who in a video posted on the US embassy’s social media channels last week said she would not hesitate to promote President Donald Trump’s political agenda in Malta. While the ambassador said the US and Malta were bound by shared democratic values and a commitment to peace and prosperity, Repubblika said it was “profoundly disturbed” by the agenda being pursued by the US administration, arguing that current policies could not be reconciled with democratic principles traditionally associated with American leadership.

Reporting by Jenna Greene Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab Opinions expressed are those of the author.","Jan 26 (Reuters) - As Renee Good's family members weigh legal action over her shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, one of their lawyers openly acknowledges the legal obstacles ahead.

“Most people would look at that video (of Good being shot) and say, ‘File that lawsuit, go get justice,’” attorney Antonio Romanucci told me. But suing the federal government is a complex undertaking, he said, involving knotty questions of legal immunity and constitutional law – even as he described the legal path the family might take.

Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter. Sign up here.

Good, 37, was shot dead in her car on Jan. 7 by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. U.S. officials allege she attempted to run him over; her defenders say video shows she steered away. Her death preceded the fatal shooting of a Minnesota man, Alex Pretti, on Saturday by U.S. immigration agents.

The U.S. Justice Department and ICE did not respond to requests for comment on Good's shooting. The Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis shot Pretti in self-defense after he approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, but video reviewed by Reuters contradicted that account.

As my colleague Jan Wolfe has reported, suing individual government agents is exceedingly difficult. An alternative is the Federal Tort Claims Act, a 1946 law that establishes government liability for injuries or deaths caused by federal employees acting within the scope of their jobs.

Punitive damages, which can dramatically increase awards, are barred, as are jury trials. In addition to injury and death claims, plaintiffs can seek compensation for emotional distress or pain and suffering, said Romanucci, a co-founder of Chicago-based Romanucci & Blandin who also represented the family of George Floyd.

For a case to succeed, however, plaintiffs often must overcome a major hurdle: the discretionary function exception.

If the government invokes the defense, a court will determine whether a federal employee's conduct involved making a judgment or choice rather than simply following rules, and whether that choice was grounded in considerations of public policy. If the answer to both is yes, the government can avoid liability.

According to a 2024 Harvard Law Review article, opens new tab, when the United States invokes the exception in moving to dismiss a claim, it succeeds in terminating nearly 75% of claims.

Romanucci said he expects the government would argue that Ross’s use of deadly force falls under the provision.

But that may not be the end of the story. Romanucci said he also anticipates that if Good’s family opts to bring a lawsuit, they'll allege Ross violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by using deadly force.

That raises a pivotal question: Does the discretionary function exception shield conduct that is allegedly unconstitutional?

The federal appellate courts are split on the answer. Most – but not all – have held government officials “do not possess discretion to violate constitutional rights or federal statutes,” as the 4th Circuit put it in 2001, opens new tab. Notably, the 8th Circuit, which includes Minnesota, reached a similar conclusion in 2003, ruling, opens new tab that government activities that violate constitutional rights fall outside the discretionary-function exception.

But the 7th and 11th Circuits have rejected that view. The 11th Circuit wrote in 2021, opens new tab that it doesn’t matter “how poorly, abusively, or unconstitutionally” an employee acted — only whether the underlying decision was discretionary.

Should Good's case proceed, this circuit split could position it for U.S. Supreme Court review.

In the meantime, recent ICE settlements show how plaintiffs alleging constitutional violations have prevailed.

For example, in 2024 a federal judge in Manhattan allowed a suit to move forward by a woman from Ecuador, identified only as MQ, who allegedly fell while shackled by ICE in 2021, broke her ankle, and waited three months in detention before receiving treatment.

After an immigration judge granted her release on bail, she spoke critically to New York lawmakers and others about her experience. She claimed ICE retaliated by placing her back in detention, in violation of her First Amendment rights.

U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter Jr. ruled, opens new tab that the government cannot claim immunity from suit “when its officers engage in tortious conduct that violates the Constitution.” The government settled the case last year for $70,000, according to records in the Judgment Fund, opens new tab, which pays settlements and judgments against the United States.

ICE in court papers denied wrongdoing. MQ’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

Judgment Fund records show other ICE-related settlements. For example, a Pennsylvania family claimed, opens new tab their Fourth Amendment rights were violated during a 2020 predawn raid in which officers allegedly injured a man and caused emotional distress to his wife and children. ICE again denied wrongdoing; the case settled for $72,500.

In total, the United States paid $5.25 million to settle 138 lawsuits involving ICE in 2025, according to Judgment Fund records, though most of the claims stemmed from traffic accidents.

Whether Good’s family can overcome the government’s defenses remains to be seen. If they sue, the case may ultimately test not just one agent’s judgment but the limits of federal accountability.

Video footage shot by bystanders shows Pretti filming a group of US Border Patrol agents on Saturday before stepping in to defend a woman who was shoved to the ground by one agent.

In footage shared by US-based Drop Site news, Pretti can be seen trying to help the woman before at least five agents tackle him to the ground and shoot him multiple times after a scuffle on the icy road.

Analysis of footage by US media and Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, shows that Pretti’s gun had already been confiscated by an agent before he was shot dead.

Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara later told reporters that Pretti was a “lawful gun owner” with a permit, and that his only criminal history was a few traffic tickets.

Despite the video evidence, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino told a news conference that Pretti’s gun showed that he “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement”.

Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security, claimed without evidence that Pretti was an “assassin” who tried to “murder federal agents”, while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said he had “violently” resisted arrest.

Popular right-wing influencers amplified the Trump administration’s claims on X.

The MAGA-allied account “Libs of TikTok” labelled Pretti a “lunatic” and an “assassin”.

Right-wing influencer Alexander Muse told his 681,000 followers that Pretti was “expecting a firefight at a distance” with federal agents despite there being no evidence that he ever took out or brandished his gun.

Some right-wing influencers went even further than echoing the Trump administration’s narrative, piling blatant misinformation on top of officials’ baseless accusations.

Trump ally Nick Sorter, who has 1.4 million followers on X, falsely claimed that Pretti, a US citizen, was an “illegal alien” who was “armed with a gun and attempted to PULL IT on agents as he was being apprehended”.

Conservative podcaster Jesse Kelly smeared Pretti as a “soldier for the communist revolution” who had “died fighting in a war” in an X post that included a photo of Pretti on a hike.

MAGA-affiliated accounts also shared digitally altered images purporting to be pictures of Pretti dressed in female clothing.

In a statement, Pretti’s parents said their son was a “kindhearted soul” and that the administration’s “sickening lies” about him were “reprehensible and disgusting”.

Claims that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” and scrutiny of his political beliefs mirror similar accusations levelled at Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was also fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Trump administration officials also described Good as a “terrorist” and claimed that she was trying to run over an immigration officer with her vehicle despite video evidence casting doubt on those claims.

Officials have also spread misleading information seemingly aimed at discrediting protests against Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown more generally.

The White House last week shared an image of an arrested activist, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that had been altered with artificial intelligence to make her look emotionally distressed.

Some Republicans have pushed back on the narrative pushed around Pretti’s death, including Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, who said on X that “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right”.

The National Rifle Association, a pro-gun lobby group, also rejected a suggestion by a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor that approaching a law enforcement officer with a gun could be grounds for being shot.

Minnesota law enforcement officials have also contested statements by Trump administration officials, including a claim by Vice President JD Vance that local authorities refused to assist their federal counterparts in the investigation into Pretti’s killing.

Several constitutional law professors struggled to find a historic example of local officials being investigated over allegations of interfering with federal law enforcement.","Several legal experts say they haven’t seen any evidence to support the allegation that several Minnesota officials obstructed recent federal immigration enforcement as members of the Trump administration have suggested.

Federal prosecutors last week delivered subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and other officials, as the Justice Department seeks records for violations of unspecified federal laws during the intense immigration enforcement crackdown in the state.

The subpoenas are related to whether the state and local officials hindered the federal enforcement through public statements they’ve made, according to the Associated Press, which reported the investigation is focused on the potential violation of a conspiracy statute.

Minnesota officials have characterized the subpoenas as “political theater,” intimidation tactics and an attack on their First Amendment rights.

“Going on TV and saying ICE is violating constitutional rights of citizens and noncitizens, that is not impeding federal immigration,” said Jill Hasday, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Law School. “That is exercising First Amendment freedoms.

“I haven’t seen any evidence where they are actually impeding federal immigration enforcement.”

Hasday called the Justice Department’s probe of local officials “highly unusual,” a sentiment echoed by several constitutional law experts who spoke with the Minnesota Star Tribune.

The experts said comments made publicly by Democrats Walz and Frey, including fierce condemnations of the ICE crackdown and calls for residents to record activity and peacefully demonstrate, are constitutionally protected. (This story was reported before remarks made Saturday, Jan. 24, when Alex Pretti was fatally shot by an agent or agents with U.S. Border Patrol.)

Many Republicans have criticized the Minnesota officials for those statements, although after Pretti’s killing, President Donald Trump went further, accusing Walz and Frey of “inciting Insurrection” in a social media post that cited “their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”

The Justice Department has not elaborated on its investigation to the Star Tribune. But the content of the subpoenas — legal orders to testify or produce documents related to a potential investigation — offer clearer insight into what federal prosecutors are seeking.

The subpoena issued to Frey’s office, which it shared, requires testimony before a grand jury on Feb. 3. It also requires the office to produce records, including documents related to the city’s cooperation with or refusal to aid immigration enforcement, refusal to comply with detainers and hindering, doxing, or surveilling immigration officers.

“Issuing subpoenas is an aggressive move,” Hasday said.

In 2018, she said, the Trump administration threatened to subpoena local officials over sanctuary city policies, making similar arguments about interfering with federal authorities. It ultimately did not carry through with the threat.

The Justice Department has filed civil lawsuits against several states and cities with sanctuary policies, alleging an obstruction of federal immigration law enforcement. In July, a federal judge dismissed such a lawsuit in Illinois. But the latest action shows an escalated approach as the department pursues a criminal investigation.

Peter Larsen, an assistant professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said such subpoenas “tend to be pretty exploratory in nature.”

“Grand jury processes themselves are very deferential, so to get a subpoena for this, you don’t have to prove that a crime occurred,” he said. “You don’t even have to really show good cause that a crime occurred.

“You only really need to show that you’re seeking materials that are relevant to a possible investigation.”

Ultimately, grand juries can decide to recommend charges or not.

The subpoena issued to Frey’s office also asks for emails, text messages, voice recordings and other communication related to federal immigration enforcement.

Federal prosecutors are likely casting a “wide net,” said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush.

“They’re looking for the needle in the haystack,” said Painter, an outspoken critic of Trump. “They’re probably trying to look for some hothead who said something really stupid.

“They’re going to go through thousands of emails to find something. I’d be extremely surprised if they found anything that would be grounds for any type of serious criminal investigation.”

However, he said, “Could they find something potentially embarrassing? Yes.”

Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official, said the subpoena of Frey’s office suggests the government is “criminally investigating state and local officials for doing what they’re entitled do to, which is not voluntarily cooperate with ICE or DHS, and instead do just what is required by law.”

Not cooperating with ICE beyond what is required by law would not amount to impeding federal immigration enforcement, she said.

McCord is also the executive director of the nonpartisan Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown, which has brought litigation against the Trump administration.

“Impeding would have to be something more than that. Impeding would require some sort of force,” she said. “I have not seen even a suggestion that these officials have engaged in force or even incited others to engage in force. They’ve been telling people to be peaceful.”

Federal subpoenas of local officials or their offices usually stem from corruption scandals, misappropriated federal funds or criminal activities, University of Minnesota Law School professor Myron Orfield said — not policy disagreement.

Several constitutional law professors struggled to find a historic example of local officials being investigated over allegations of interfering with federal law enforcement.

Orfield said the closest example he can think of is the massive resistance by several Southern governors to federal court-ordered integration during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s.

“Many governors opposed federal court orders on integration and used very strong language, called the federal government communists and everything you can think of,” Orfield said. “And they were never investigated” for their political views or statements.

Another example, Larsen said, is when the government brought charges against several members of the Ku Klux Klan and local law enforcement in the killings of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964.

The suspects were charged with conspiring to deprive the three men of their civil rights (loosely, the basis of the movie “Mississippi Burning.”) At the time, the state declined to press murder charges.

“That’s the comparator we have, really. We really don’t see this happening in other times and places,” Larsen said.

At the same time, he said, this is different.

“We’re talking about criminal obstruction,” he said. “With criminal obstruction, typically that’s a much higher bar and we don’t see that in modern history.”

Ultimately, Larsen said, a grand jury could recommend issuing charges, or it could reject the prosecutors’ argument and decline charges. Such was the case in December when a grand jury declined to federally indict New York Attorney General Leticia James.

“A lot of investigations that do come before grand juries tend to end quietly and tend to end without charges,” Larsen said. “Also if the (Justice Department) did ultimately bring charges, this would be a pretty novel application, it’s a break from historical practice, and it’s a major escalation in this federal-state conflict.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/RB5KHq6eaUSaCX2wtltfMQqKy5k=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2026/01/25/69769a1e0158c.hires.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 08:57:58.968441

Then, on Monday afternoon, a hearing is set for a joint lawsuit from the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that seeks to force federal agents to maintain any evidence related to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.

Hours after Pretti was killed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was in Washington, DC, visiting the White House for a screening of Melania, a documentary produced by First Lady Melania Trump. As Jassy and other guests entered, a military band played “Melania’s Waltz,” a song composed for the film. Guests received “glossy, commemorative black and white popcorn boxes for guests, served by gloved waiters.”

Amazon paid $59 million for the rights to the vanity project, most of which went to Melania Trump herself. According to Matt Belloni, Amazon is paying another $35 million to promote the film. Despite the massive budget, Amazon “has not shared the film with critics, and won’t before its release.”

Although Melania will almost certainly lose tens of millions of dollars for Amazon, it is a small price to pay to stay in the good graces of President Donald Trump and his administration. Amazon has billions in government contracts and provides much of the technological backbone for ICE’s surveillance and deportation activities.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts the database, known as Investigative Case Management (ICM), that ICE uses to target and deport immigrants. ICM, which was created by Palantir, “integrates a vast ecosystem of public and private data to track down immigrants and, in many cases, deport them.” The data includes “a person’s immigration history, family relationships, personal connections, addresses, phone records, biometric traits, and other information.” Through Palantir, AWS receives millions of dollars annually from the federal government to host ICM.

Last April, the Trump administration awarded Palantir a new $30 million contract to create “ImmigrationOS,” which is “a new tool to provide [ICE] with enhanced capabilities to support deportation efforts.” ImmigrationOS is likely hosted on AWS, which has a strategic partnership with Palantir.

AWS also hosts a massive surveillance system for ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The $6 billion system, known as Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART), is designed to hold “personal and biometric data on over 270 million people, including 6.7 million iris scans and 1.1 billion face images.”

In a 2022 letter to Amazon, advocates argued that by “hosting DHSʼ HART database, AWS is directly facilitating the creation of an invasive biometrics database that will supercharge surveillance and deportation, risking human rights violations.” They urged Amazon to stop powering the HART database, which is still in development, but the company did not respond.

When Amazon employees urged then-CEO Jeff Bezos to terminate its relationship with ICE in 2018, Bezos defended the practice. “There aren’t other countries where everybody is trying to get in,” Bezos told WIRED. “I’d let them in if it were me. I like ‘em, I want all of them in. But this is a great country and it does need to be defended.”

On its corporate webpage, Amazon says it “support[s] our refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant population because we recognize the challenges they face in the U.S.” This is the same population being targeted in Minneapolis.

In November 2025, Amazon announced it was investing $50 billion to build out its cloud and AI services for the federal government. ICE and related agencies are in a position to provide Amazon with a return on its investment. Trump’s megabill, enacted last year, “allocated more than $170 billion over four years for border and interior enforcement.”

Amazon, which did not respond to a request for comment, is one of several consumer-facing brands with deep financial connections to ICE.

Citizens Bank

Since Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the population of migrants held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has exploded — from below 40,000 in January 2025 to over 73,000 today. This has created a massive demand for private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic, to build new facilities.

Numerous financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, SunTrust, BNP Paribas, and Fifth Third Bancorp, pledged in 2019 to stop working with the private prison industry. (Bank of America and SunTrust have since “softened their policy statements to allow financing again for detention companies in some circumstances.”)

But Citizens Financial Group, which operates Citizens Bank, has continued to provide financing for private prison construction. In July 2025, Citizens provided a $450 million revolving credit line to GEO Group. Earlier, in March 2025, Citizens underwrote $500 million in bonds for CoreCivic.

On its website, Citizens says it is “committed to strengthening communities“ and works “to advance social equity.” The company did not respond to a request for comment.

AT&T

In September 2024, AT&T inked a 10-year, $147 million contract with ICE’s parent agency, DHS, to “provide mission-critical communications services.” The agreement provides ICE and other DHS subdivisions with “end-to-end voice priority over the AT&T commercial wireless network.” In August, the Trump administration awarded AT&T an $11 million no-bid contract to provide ICE with “data analytics and support services.”

AT&T pitched FirstNet, its specialized network for first responders, to the federal government, touting its ability to use “photographs, real-time audio/video feeds, and databases from other state, local, or Federal agencies… to aid in the identification… of undocumented immigrants.”

AT&T’s Human Rights Policy, last updated in August 2025, says the company seeks “to ensure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses.” It also stresses that “all people, regardless of status or circumstance, deserve the dignity and freedom of human rights protections.”

Last November, activists in Chicago accused AT&T of “lin[ing] its pockets with public dollars” from ICE, “whose agents are masked, unidentifiable, and operating without warrants as they terrorize members of the public.”

The US president told the Wall Street Journal in a short interview that immigration enforcement officers would leave the Minneapolis area “at some point”.

The publication said Trump did not directly answer when asked twice whether the officer who shot Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, had done the right thing. Pressed further, he said: “We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.”

It said Trump criticised Pretti for carrying a gun during protest activity, quoting the president as saying: “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”

Trump signalled a willingness to eventually withdraw immigration enforcement officials from the Minneapolis area, saying: “At some point we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done a phenomenal job.”

A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after Pretti’s fatal shooting – a sign that the Trump administration’s accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.

The Republican chair of the House homeland security committee, Andrew Garbarino, has sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection and US Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe”, according to the Associated Press.

Other congressional Republicans have pressed for more information, including the Texas representative Michael McCaul and the senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflects a party struggling with how to respond to federal agents’ killing of Pretti.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) almost immediately alleged Pretti had “violently resisted” officers, saying they fired “defensive shots”. Video evidence contradicts that account. Trump also shared an image of the pistol allegedly found on Pretti in a Truth Social post, writing: “This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!) and ready to go.”

Pretti was reportedly legally permitted to carry a gun. Widely circulated video of his shooting death does not appear to depict him holding a gun; it does show an officer reaching to Pretti’s lower back and stepping away with what appeared to be a pistol – and Pretti being subsequently shot to death.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest pro-gun group, also responded after Bill Essayli – who was appointed by Trump to temporarily serve as a US attorney in California in 2025 – posted on social media: “If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.”

The NRA posted: “This sentiment … is dangerous and wrong. Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former House Republican from Georgia, posted in support of law enforcement, but defended the right to legally carry firearms. “I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement. However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment,” Greene wrote. “Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.

She added: “I support American’s 1st and 4th amendment rights. There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing.”

Democrats have vowed to withhold further funding from DHS unless a bill soon to come before the Senate is amended to include reforms that would restrict federal agents’ actions in their deportation surge.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said Democrats would not provide the necessary votes if DHS funding remained in the measure. A spokesperson for the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said DHS and other government funds would be voted on as a single package. Without a compromise, the government faces a partial shutdown at the end of January.

The Connecticut Democratic senator Chris Murphy told CNN’s State of the Union that Democrats “can’t vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security … that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country, in violation of the law.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e2893dd202a8bed3b5c19ad4d2407a53d5c391/295_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6608323097a495008f3614d03b0ef587",N,,2026-01-26 08:57:33.620952

The big picture: While administration officials stayed on message and backed the federal agents in Minnesota, the criticisms show Republican cracks over Trump's increasingly unpopular immigration agenda.

What they're saying: One of the most high profile warnings came from Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) who signaled to the administration — albeit gently — that federal agents should leave Minneapolis.

""If I were President Trump I would almost think about ... if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harms way and there's a chance of losing more innocent lives ... then maybe go to another city,"" he said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Comer predicted Minnesotans would ""rebel against their leadership"" while he still blamed state officials.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is overseeing a precarious appropriations process as immigration enforcement surges in her state, said in a statement to Axios that the shooting ""needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.""

She added, ""I urge protestors to keep space between themselves and law enforcement and not to interfere with operations.""

Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) called the situation ""horrifying"" in a Sunday statement and called for a ""prioritized, transparent investigation."" He also said his support for funding ICE has not changed.

Zoom out: Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), head of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Saturday requested testimony from officials leading ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

However, his letters did not directly mention Saturday's shooting.

Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.) applauded the requests, saying he was ""disturbed"" by the video out of Minnesota and stressing the importance of transparency in immigration enforcement operations.

Yes, but: Many of the Republicans who spoke out, including Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), are retiring or have frequently broken with Trump.

They implored federal agents to cooperate with local law enforcement and avoid a rush to judgment.

""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,"" wrote Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). ""The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

The other side: White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson praised the ""heroic"" immigration officers for capturing criminals ""despite violent resistance and dangerous, untrue smears against them.""

Catch up quick: After federal officials shot Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security claimed he had approached the officers with a gun and appeared to want to ""massacre law enforcement.""

Top officials were also quick to label Pretti a domestic terrorist.

However, footage from the scene shows Pretti filming the officers with a camera before he was sprayed with chemical agents and wrestled to the ground. Afterwards several shots ring out.

Local officials have said Pretti lawfully possessed his weapon.

Friction point: Democrats are already demanding Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment, and the handling of Pretti's death threatens the administration's credibility even among allies, Axios' Marc Caputo reports.

Notably, the incident put feds on a collision course with second amendment advocacy groups, typically friendlier to a gun-rights-focused GOP.

Prominent voices in the splintered MAGA media landscape and broader conservative media criticized administration officials' rhetoric after the shooting, on the concealed-carry issue and beyond.

Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.","As federal immigration enforcement activity increases in Democratic-led states across the country, immigrant advocates and civil rights groups are warning that Virginia — which recently flipped full control of state government to Democrats — could be next.

Gov. Abigail Spanberger, sworn in earlier this month as Virginia’s 75th governor, has moved quickly to draw a line between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, while acknowledging that much of the authority still rests outside her control.

Just hours after taking the oath of office on Jan. 17, Spanberger fulfilled a promise she made in an August interview with The Mercury, rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47.

The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.

Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.

“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week.

She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”

“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities.

“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”

On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.

About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.

“We’re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,” said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.

State action, limited reach

While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.

All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new Legal Aid Justice Center analysis found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.

The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.

The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.

“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation.

“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”

LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.

According to ICE’s own website, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.

Fear, trust and public safety

Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.

“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.

“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”

The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.

“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.

Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety

Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.

Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.

“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”

House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, also warned that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime.

“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. “When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”

However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.

According to ICE’s own figures, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses.

In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were “violent criminals,” but Miyares at the time declined to provide evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury.

Local leaders respond

In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in Chesterfield County and Petersburg.

“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”

Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.

“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.

“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”

Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials confirmed receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.

County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.

Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.

Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.

A broader political test

The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.

In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent fatally shot a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, Walz demanded that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident.

Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.

Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law.

In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor caught between immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey under pressure to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control.

Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.

“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.

Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.","On January 12, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address a deepening circuit split about the process for certifying collective class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA"") and the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""). As a result, uncertainty persists for employers and employees alike, with federal courts adopting a range of standards.

Historical Class Certification Standard

Both Rule 23 class actions and FLSA section 216(b) collective actions allow employees to bring suit on behalf of others who are ""similarly situated."" Section 216(b) mandates employee-plaintiffs opt-in to the lawsuit, which requires courts to approve and oversee the circulation of class notice to potential plaintiffs. The same process applies to ADEA class actions. In Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court authorized the sending of notice of a FLSA collective action to potential opt-in plaintiffs so long as that notice is neutral, timely and accurate. Following the Supreme Court's holding in Hoffman-La Roche, most federal courts adopted a plaintiff-friendly, two-step analysis articulated in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. Under the Lusardi approach, plaintiffs who demonstrate that employees are ""similarly situated"" based on a ""modest factual showing"" achieve conditional certification.

Conditional certification permits district courts to oversee the circulation of notice to potential class action members. Courts then consider final certification or decertification at a later point in the case. Practically, this lenient standard has increased class sizes and created pressure for employers to settle early, before incurring the time and expense associated with the seemingly perfunctory ""conditional"" certification process and, thereafter, the final, evidence-based class certification decision.

Seventh Circuit's Approach

In August, the Seventh Circuit, in Richards v. Eli Lilly & Company, departed from the two-step Lusardi analysis. There, the Seventh Circuit held that district courts must consider evidence from both sides concerning whether workers are similarly situated enough to proceed together. Under the Seventh Circuit's approach in Richards, a plaintiff must first make a threshold showing that there is a material factual dispute as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. Thereafter, employer/defendants may submit rebuttal evidence. Once the court determines a material dispute exists, the decision to issue notice rests on its assessment of the factual dispute before it. Overall, this standard requires more evidence than Lusardi, which can reduce the pressure employers feel to settle that has traditionally accompanied conditional certification.

Fifth and Sixth Circuit Approach

Like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have moved away from the traditional Lusardi standard.

In the Fifth Circuit (Swales v. KLLM Transport Services LLC), plaintiffs must meet a more demanding one-step test, showing it is ""more likely than not"" that employees are similarly situated. When crafting this standard in Swales, the Fifth Circuit noted the more lenient Lusardi approach resulted in broad circulation of conditional class notice to plaintiffs who were not truly similarly situated. This was frequently used as leverage against employers to compel them to settle. Similar to the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit now requires lower courts to vet plaintiffs at the outset of litigation and consider all available evidence before authorizing class notices. This standard is far more favorable to employer/defendants.

In the Sixth Circuit (Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC), plaintiffs must demonstrate a ""strong likelihood"" that the proposed group is similarly situated. The Sixth Circuit rejected the ""more likely than not"" standard as too high of a bar for plaintiffs, but found the Lusardi approach too lenient. Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff must make a showing that goes beyond creating a genuine issue of fact, but it need not rise to the level of ""more likely than not"" or a ""preponderance"". Accordingly, the standard of proof in the Sixth Circuit falls between Lusardi and Swales.

The Supreme Court Denies Certiorari in Richards

In Richards, Eli Lilly submitted a petition for certiorari—which was joined by several amici—arguing that it was critical the Supreme Court resolve the growing circuit split in class certification standards. Last week, however, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Richards will now head back to the district court, which will likely apply the new Seventh Circuit standard to determine class certification.

What Employers Need to Know

The Supreme Court's refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions. While most federal courts continue to apply the Lusardi approach—a relatively low bar for plaintiffs to obtain condition certification—recent decisions in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have created stricter, more employer-friendly standards. These varying criteria will almost certainly have the strategic effect of encouraging collective action plaintiffs to file suit—if jurisdictionally possible—in circuits other than the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh. Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good.
The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts.
Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.","The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.

By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department.

As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.”

Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.

Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists.

A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out.

In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.

“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Pretti’s body.

“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”

“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.

The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.

Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.

A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.

On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.

“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.

Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.

Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.

“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.

Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him.

“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote.

Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began.

Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms. On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.

“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.

False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement. A group of right-wing activists led by Mike Lindell — the pillow mogul currently running for governor as a Republican — claimed widespread voter fraud after the 2020 election. But as part of the state’s usual election auditing process, a random group of precincts in every congressional district were chosen for review, totaling roughly 440,000 votes after the 2020 election, spanning more than 200 precincts. The hand tallies were virtually identical to the machine tallies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0763-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 06:58:07.846046

The surge of federal force to Minneapolis is testing long-held understandings of constitutional rights and the restraint, humanity and accountability owed to the governed by those who govern them in a democratic society.

By insisting that details of two killings that millions of Americans saw on cellphone videos did not take place, senior administration officials are fracturing reality and implying that their brazen power can be wielded with impunity.

And by prejudging and distorting the tragedy in its immediate aftermath, the officials have prejudiced an investigation they will conduct into one of the gravest events that can happen in a republic: government law enforcement killing a citizen.

A moment of national reckoning is building over the principles embedded in America’s moral and legal foundations — which will be extolled this year in celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

Alex Pretti’s shooting also has more prosaic political implications. It’s the latest incident that raises questions over whether Trump, with his diminished approval ratings on most issues, has lost the public only a year into his second term. The administration’s unrepentant response is also another sign that it may be prepared to defy political fallout — even in a midterm election year — in its race to irrevocably change the US and the world.

Every sign Sunday was that the White House will not back down. But CNN reported on disquiet among Department of Homeland Security officials at the aggressive and polarizing approach of Secretary Kristi Noem. The former South Dakota governor could be vulnerable should Trump seek a new course.

Saturday’s tragedy also presented Democrats with a new dilemma on balancing fierce demands from base voters to try to thwart Trump’s strongman rule while having only limited power in Washington. The party hopes to keep attention on the president’s biggest current liability — his denial of an affordability crisis hampering working families.

In the past, Democrats have stumbled when Trump has lashed them as weak on crime and immigration and hostile to law enforcement. But the political heat is so intense that some Democratic senators are vowing to block a DHS funding bill, which could spark a partial government shutdown at the week’s end.

A tragedy that went national in a moment

The death of Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse and US citizen, on Saturday quickly flashed up in horrific, graphic detail on millions of cellphones. Once again, less than three weeks after the shooting death of Renee Good, outside federal forces gunned down a Minnesotan and deepened a national political and societal crisis.

Trump’s second term has been exhausting as the rush of events and recrimination shreds perspective about any single shock. While it’s difficult to assess the lasting significance of events in real time, there’s a growing sense that Minnesota could represent a definitional moment.

“What we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.”

The administration complains that Democratic local officials are not cooperating with 3,000 federal agents sent to Minnesota ostensibly to deport undocumented migrants with criminal records. It says that protesters who document agents’ activity are endangering them and breaking the law. Officials’ claims that “agitators” have joined protests may also contain some truth.

Trump on Sunday issued a series of demands on Minnesota officials and put the blame for the deaths of Pretti and Good not on aggressive federal agents, but rather on Democrats. He wrote on Truth Social the party was “putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved. Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos.”

White House officials correctly state that one reason Trump was elected for a second term in 2024 was that Americans despaired at former President Joe Biden’s failure to secure the southern border. Some Republicans regard rhetoric from Democratic leaders such as Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey as inflammatory, playing to a liberal gallery and sure to spike dangerous tensions.

But there’s no evidence voters signed up for groups of armed and masked agents roaming city streets in SUVs or for sudden escalations that have left two citizens dead. Or that they think the constitutional right to protest should be abridged by an administration that seems to have chosen a Democratic state for a power play.

Americans have also not signed off on the apparent new erosions of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search as directed in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo last week. Federal agents who have refused local law enforcement access to the scenes of shootings and administration officials who have shut down independent investigations of the deaths are also raising questions about legal safeguards over state power.

One critical political question in the coming days will be whether even those Americans who backed Trump’s hardline promises on border security will reject his imposition of ruthless federal power in deportations. It is possible that shocking incidents like Saturday’s — or the heartrending photos of the detention of a 5-year-old preschooler in Minnesota last week — will further erode his political foundation.

“President Trump closed the border, promised to get violent criminals out of our country,” Stitt told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“I think everybody agrees with that,” Stitt went on. “But now Americans are asking themselves, ‘What is the endgame? What is the solution?’ We believe in federalism and state rights. And nobody likes feds coming into their state.”

‘A wake-up call’

This specter of federal power descending from out of state — in a way that seems antithetical to America’s republican DNA — is concentrating many minds and raising the possibility that Minnesota’s plight could become a galvanizing force nationally.

A sense of a coming national moment of decision was reinforced by detailed written statements by two Democratic former presidents. In a statement Sunday, Bill Clinton said, “Over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decision we make and the actions we take shape our history for years to come. This is one of them.” The 42nd president added: “It’s up to all of us who believe in the promise of American democracy to stand up, speak out and show that our nation still belongs to We the People.”

Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote Sunday that the killing of Pretti is “a heartbreaking tragedy. It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”

Trump’s base — which rallied to his tough immigration rhetoric in 2016 — would argue that lax border enforcement also infringed those values.

But the crackdown has become about more than immigration. Like the Pentagon’s killings of alleged drug traffickers in the Pacific and Caribbean and Trump’s bid to extort Greenland from Denmark, it’s a manifestation of a White House that increasingly embraces rogue tactics and spurns due process in the interest of demonstrating its own power.

Administration reaction to Pretti’s killing recalled the character assassination, victim-blaming and distortions of the aftermath of Good’s death. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a “would be assassin” on X. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino said the deceased man showed up to “massacre” federal agents. And Noem suggested that federal agents fired defensively at Pretti while fearing for their lives because he was armed.

In a charged political moment, it is nevertheless objectively true that these depictions are not supported on cellphone footage seen by millions of Americans. These instant artifacts of a new age when everything unfolds on social videos suggest federal agents escalated the situation with Pretti, who was filming their activity; forced him to the ground; and then fired multiple shots at him at point-blank range, apparently after he was disarmed.

On Sunday, officials continued to try to deny the visual record. “The victims are the Border Patrol agents,” Bovino told CNN’s Bash. He added, “The suspect put himself in that situation,” using a questionable description of Pretti, who did not appear to commit any crime.

Noem said, “We can’t have individuals that are impeding law enforcement operations and then showing up with guns and weapons and no ID and confronting law enforcement.” FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that “you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions.”

There is no evidence so far that Pretti, who had a permit to carry the gun and was not shown on any video brandishing a weapon, was doing anything other than exercising his First and Second Amendment rights.

In emotive confrontations between law enforcement and citizens, there’s always the possibility that not every angle or dimension is captured on camera. This is why investigations are so important in killings involving agents and officers. But Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday that federal officials denied access to the scene of the Pretti’s killing to the state investigative agency that probes law enforcement shootings.

Top officials including Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche promised an investigation. But it’s set to be conducted by the DHS with the help of the FBI. So, as in the case of Good’s death, the government officials who have already prejudged the killings and denied visual evidence will oversee the findings. There can be little public confidence that they will not be politically tainted.

‘Not what’s happening’

Outsiders cannot say what was in the mind of the officers involved with Pretti. But the impunity immediately offered to those who killed Good seems unlikely to have introduced any sense of restraint among their colleagues. Logic suggests the administration’s direct support for these aggressive ICE and Border Patrol tactics only makes future tragedies more likely.

The open denial of events that millions of Americans can see unfold on video, meanwhile, seems to go beyond normal hardball politics. It’s beginning to look like a president who believes he enjoys unchecked power wanting to demonstrate he can reinvent the reality of a nation he leads.

“It should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily, will lie to your face, when you can see the evidence for yourself,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on “State of the Union.” “The fact of the matter is, Minneapolis is fundamentally less safe because ICE and CBP are there.”

Murphy also argued that the violent confrontations between Minnesotans and federal officers were a feature rather than an unwanted byproduct of Trump’s policies. “They are there to cause a conflict. They are there to create mayhem. And it isn’t going to be just isolated to Minneapolis,” he said.

The question now is whether Trump’s political underpinnings will break before his method of framing alternate narratives — with the help of a compliant conservative media machine.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2257495092.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:39.526231

A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.

“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Rosen said Noem’s conduct is “deeply shameful” and she “must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”

Impeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.

And while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.

Noem defends fatal shooting

The senator’s call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.

During the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.

Noem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”

“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.

In her call for Noem’s impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.

Senate anger over ICE violence

Rosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”

And while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem’s impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.

Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”

As administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

House Democrats increasingly back Noem’s impeachment

Calls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.

Most of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem’s impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.

New York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”

“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.

Protests continued in Minneapolis and other US cities on Sunday over the fatal shooting by immigration agents of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said America was at an ""inflection point"" and repeated calls for US President Donald Trump to remove federal immigration agents from the city.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot on Saturday because he was ""brandishing"" a gun. Local authorities deny this, adding that the gun was legally registered and that he was shot after the gun was removed.

Trump has signalled that he might be willing to eventually withdraw ICE agents from the Minneapolis area but has not given a time frame.

""At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job,"" he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Sunday.

Multiple vigils were held for Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend. He is the second person to be fatally shot in the city during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown this month.

Lifelong resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those who gathered on Sunday afternoon to pay her respects and protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

""I'm tired of protesting,"" she told the BBC. ""We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?""

Demonstrators of all ages were chanting ""No more Minnesota nice - Minneapolis on strike"" and ""ICE out now"" before they began moving through the city streets.

""This is not the America I fought for,"" said one man the BBC spoke to, who asked not to be named.

Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The chief executives of more than 60 Minnesota-based businesses, including 3M, Best Buy and Target have also signed an open letter calling for ""an immediate de-escalation of tensions"" and for local and federal officials ""to work together to find real solutions"".

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told the BBC that state officers were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's shooting by federal agents, despite securing a search warrant.

He added that all levels of law enforcement in Minnesota have been working with federal law enforcement ""for several years"", and that the unfolding situation in Minnesota was hampering agencies' ability to continue such investigations.

Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.

The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety effort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. It has also described Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist"".

Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.

Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment, saying: ""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting"".

They added that he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to Associated Press (AP), court records show he had no criminal record.

""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,"" his family said in the statement.

On Sunday, Tim Walz said: ""I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America.

""If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.""

Backlash against the Trump administration's crackdown is growing, including from within the Republican party.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt told CNN that people were watching fellow Americans being shot on television and that ""federal tactics and accountability"" had become a growing concern for voters.

Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said the Minneapolis shooting was ""incredibly disturbing"" and ""the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

Democrats have responded by threatening to block a key government financing package if it contains funds for the Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, raising the prospect of another government shutdown.

Former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both criticised the situation in Minneapolis, with the former described events in Minneapolis as ""horrible scenes"" that ""I never thought would take place in America.""

Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally.

Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as ""EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States"" must ""formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence"".

He also called on US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of ""all these problems"".

The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities.

Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging ""left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations"".

Federal agents shot and killed Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, and videos have since emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and Pretti just before the shooting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.

O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a ""full investigation"" into the killing of Pretti.

In a statement, it said: ""Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens.""

US Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were looking for a man named Jose Huerta Chuma during a ""targeted"" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanour-level traffic offences from more than a decade ago.

The latest shooting follows weeks of tensions between the Minnesota authorities, federal agents and protesters who have taken to the streets to observe the agents during their anti-immigration raids.

Earlier this month, an ICE agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation.

In a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, Good's family law firm Romanucci & Blandin urged all Americans to ""trust their own eyes as they interpret the horrific video"" of Pretti's shooting.

Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers.
Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025.
The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024.
“So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.

“I would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,” Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.

A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China’s Xinjiang region.

The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.

Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said “there was no help from the outside world” and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.

He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.

“We are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,” said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.”

Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.

“This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,” she said in a written response to a request for comment. “All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.”

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan’s case, the Illinois Democrat called for “careful adherence to due process and America’s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.”

Immigrants can apply for asylum when there’s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.

Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That’s about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.

The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked “abandoned” when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group’s chief operating officer. He said it’s not yet clear what caused the rise.

In cities across the country, some immigrants have stopped showing up for routine hearings after agents began making arrests right in the courtrooms, turning them into deportation traps.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.

The Chinese government has denied the allegations, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Beijing tolerates little dissent, especially on issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Communist Party rule, and has largely silenced dissent through a range of coercive means, including detention and “forced disappearances.”

Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said he was unfamiliar with the specifics of Guan’s case but defended China’s policy toward Xinjiang.

“The Chinese government has consistently worked to promote and protect human rights, and the development and progress in Xinjiang are plain to see and should not be smeared,” Liu said in a statement.

With the footage in hand, Guan knew he had to leave the country if he was to publish it. He went first to Hong Kong without a further plan. “I played it by ear,” he said.

From Hong Kong, he flew to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could then travel without a visa, and then on to the Bahamas before sailing to Florida in October 2021. By the time he arrived, he had released most of his video footage on YouTube.

Guan settled in Queens, a borough in New York City, and said he tried to live a “stable” life. Once he had a work permit, he worked as an Uber driver and did deliveries. He cut off contact with nearly all of his relatives back in China so they would not be harassed by the police.

He said he cherished the freedom from fear he enjoyed in the U.S. Then Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched his mass deportation campaign.

Guan said he understands why Trump has taken such a radical approach.

“It’s because the past immigration policy was too lax and caused resentment from many people,” Guan said, adding that he considers such fluctuations to be “normal” in a democratic society.

“No matter what it is, any issue gets both support and opposition,” he said. “I also have come to know that people in all parts of the country are protesting the government’s too aggressive behavior.”

Local residents who don’t know him personally have shown their support, Guan said. “So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said. “At the same time, I’ve felt the warmth of the U.S. society.”

Should he be released, he said he would cherish the opportunity to stay in the United States.

“I would like to do meaningful things,” Guan said. “I hope to establish some connections with others so that I can help others.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mariettatimes.com/images/2026/01/24141315/AP-US-China-Detainee-750x500.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 05:58:47.570915

I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents.
The federal agents, Bovino added, “prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement.
Was he simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road, and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement?
“We heard the law enforcement officer say gun, gun, gun.","Bovino replied, “The victim? The victims are the Border Patrol agents. I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation.”

Bovino said that Pretti had “injected” himself into a federal law enforcement operation and was “more than likely” on the scene to assault officers.

The federal agents, Bovino added, “prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement. So good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that.”

Pretti was shot and killed Saturday morning as CBP agents continued to patrol Minneapolis streets as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. He is the second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis to be killed by immigration officers in recent weeks. Renee Good was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month in the city.

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have questioned why Pretti was in an area where agents were on the scene to arrest a “violent” illegal immigrant and accused him of interfering with federal law enforcement operations.

“Let’s look at why he was there in the first place. Was he simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road, and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement? Or was he there for a reason?” Bovino said on Sunday.

Video footage of the moments leading up to the shooting and verified by several media outlets, including the New York Times, shows Pretti filming the scene with his phone. While federal officials assert Pretti was holding a gun, video of the incident does not appear to corroborate the allegations. The analysis from the New York Times concludes that agents did not identify Pretti had a gun until about eight seconds after they had wrestled him to the ground.

While Pretti did hold a concealed carry license, video footage of the shooting from multiple angles appears to show Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as he approaches a woman who had been shoved to the ground by agents.

“Are you saying it’s not okay for him to exercise his Second Amendment right, not to mention his First Amendment right to be there in the first place, and if you do you can be shot by federal law enforcement?” Bash asked.

“No, I didn’t say that, Dana. I never said that,” Bovino replied. “What I’m saying is we respect that Second Amendment right. But those rights don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers.”

Bovino added he does not know if Pretti was unarmed at the time of the incident but said that agents believed he was in possession of one. “We heard the law enforcement officer say gun, gun, gun. So at some point they knew there was a gun,” he said.

Video footage does not appear to show Pretti holding a gun as he tried to help the woman stand. Still, agents surround Pretti and force him to the ground before opening fire.

Bovino said he doesn’t know how many agents opened fire, but that those involved “will more than likely be on administrative duty” and relocated out of Minneapolis.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F17%2Ff3%2Fe0c114bc42cfa18851c17eb05747%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-61236.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 00:58:01.283994

Should you be arrested or somebody you know be detained by immigration agents, have an emergency plan in place.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are continuing to crack down on undocumented citizens across the United States, including large-scale operations in Chicago, Charlotte, Minneapolis and Portland. Most recently, federal agents shot and killed a Minneapolis woman witnessing an immigration detainment. Agents also shot and injured a man in Portland.

The escalating protests have led to a need to know your legal rights, such as when attending a protest or being pulled over by federal agents. Here you’ll find answers to common questions, ranging from whether you can legally be arrested at a peaceful protest to what to say prior to being detained.

Please note that for specific immigration-related legal questions, consult a lawyer.

I’m going to protest. Can I be arrested?

So long as the protest remains peaceful, you can’t be legally arrested. Citizens and non-citizens alike have First Amendment rights, which include the right to peacefully gather in public forums like streets, sidewalks, parks or plazas. Check with organizers to see if they have a permit for the protest, especially if people plan to march in the streets.

People without status, however, should be careful. According to the National Immigration Law Center, courts have not been consistent with their First Amendment rulings involving people who are undocumented. If you do choose to protest, have a plan in place in case you need to make a quick exit.

Claudia Murphy, a patrol lieutenant for the Bellingham Police Department, said police leadership will have conversations with organizers ahead of time to get an idea of the number of participants, where the gathering is happening and collect contact information.

“That has worked out really, really well for us being able to have that open line of communication,” she said. “Because the people who are gathering for the protest, they also want their folks to be safe.”

But if illegal activity, like an assault, breaks out, then police do have the right to arrest perpetrators.

“Once laws are broken, it is no longer a First Amendment right to do that,” Murphy said.

Can I film police officers or federal agents?

Yes. Filming police officers or federal agents is protected under the First Amendment. Plus, it’s legal in Washington.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem equated filming federal officers to doxxing in July during a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on the doxxing comment in September.

“We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.

That flies in the face of what seven federal circuit courts have ruled: filming law enforcement is a protected right. The Supreme Court, however, has not weighed in on the issue.

Chicago-based journalists filed a lawsuit in October alleging federal immigration agents suppressed the journalists’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights by using excessive force.

Can immigration agents come into my house or board public transportation without a warrant?

It depends.

Because we in Whatcom and Skagit counties live within 100 miles of the border, federal law allows for Customs and Border Patrol Agents and other immigration officials to board buses and trains without a warrant. You can also be pulled over if federal law enforcement suspects someone in the vehicle committed an immigration violation or a federal crime.

On the train or bus, federal agents should ask brief questions about passengers’ immigration status and ask to see documentation. But passengers have the right to remain silent.

Should you be pulled over, federal agents should be asking questions related to why they conducted the traffic stop. You can ask about probable cause for the stop and the agent should state why. You can also ask if you’re free to leave, or you can remain silent.

However, noncitizens can still be detained without a warrant.

To make matters more complicated, for those living within 25 miles of the Canadian border in Whatcom County, immigration agents are allowed to enter private property, like a yard or ranch land, without a warrant, according to the ACLU. But their jurisdiction is narrow. If agents want to enter a house, or “dwelling,” they cannot do so without a warrant. Those inside the house can also request to review a signed warrant by a judge.

Recent reporting by the Associated Press revealed a memo circulating by ICE authorizing officers to enter homes without warrants signed by federal judges. Rather, officers can enter the home of someone with a final order of removal so long as they have an administrative warrant. The memo jeopardizes rights under the Fourth Amendment which bars unlawful searches and seizures.

Are local police and sheriff deputies working with immigration agents?

In Washington state, under the 2019 Keep Washington Working Act (KWW), it is illegal for Washington law enforcement to conduct civil immigration arrests in partnership with federal authorities.

Whatcom County Sheriff Donnell Tanksley said the last year has been one of reeducation in telling people that his office and deputies have a policy not to work with immigration authorities on civil arrests.

“Some people, not all people, but some people do not want to believe that local law enforcement are not working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities,” he said.

However, local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents if there is a criminal investigation into an individual.

Following an immigration-related detainment in Lynden in October, where members of the sheriff’s office’s SWAT team assisted in establishing a perimeter after federal law enforcement requested backup, Tanksley requested a meeting with the Washington state Attorney General’s Office to ensure he was in compliance with KWW.

An arrest warrant signed by a federal judge had been presented. The U.S. Border Patrol said the man arrested was a member of the Sureño gang and was under investigation for assault on a federal officer. Tanksley does not have the power to call the judge to request an explanation of the warrant.

The AG’s Office told Tanksley he was within the rights of the law.

“Maybe the optics didn’t look well, but it was there for a criminal violation,” he said. “I know a lot of people are concerned, but there’s definitely two different things going on here at the federal level that they’re doing with immigration, and what we’re doing here at the sheriff’s office is criminal investigations.”

How can I visibly tell police and federal immigration agents apart?

Bellingham police officers will have police on the back of their uniforms as well as on the front of their vests, said Murphy, the police lieutenant. The uniforms are deep blue in color and the badges feature Old City Hall on them — a unique identifier.

Police SWAT teams will wear a muted brown color but will still have a badge that says Bellingham Police on it.

Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office deputies will have patches with the sheriff’s office logo on them.

As for federal agents, it depends on the agency. Most recently, with federal immigration enforcement, agents have been in plain clothes with brown or black vests. Sometimes, the patches on the vest read ERO, or Enforcement Removal Operation, or HSI, Homeland Security Investigation. ICE can also be seen on patches. But sometimes, there is only “police” on the vest.

Federal immigration agents have also been frequently covering their faces with masks. Local law enforcement officials will not wear face coverings.

In Washington state, the legislature is mulling a bill to make it illegal for local, state and federal law enforcement to wear face coverings. California put a similar law in place at the beginning of the year.

State law already requires officers to be “reasonably identifiable” while on duty but does not specify language about face coverings.

What do I do if I’m stopped by federal immigration agents?

Remain calm and don’t run away. Don’t lie to officers or show false documentation.

Henry Hwang, directing attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, told KUOW he has differing advice based on someone’s immigration status on what to do if they’re pulled over by ICE.

Hwang said if you’re undocumented, remain silent and ask if you’re free to go. If the agent says no, then say you would like to speak with a lawyer. If you have legal status or are a citizen, you could show proof, such as a passport. Again, ask if you’re free to go.

If you’re at a protest and you’re stopped, ask if you’re free to leave. And if you are arrested, ask police why.

Should you be arrested or somebody you know be detained by immigration agents, have an emergency plan in place. That means making sure someone can take care of children and memorizing emergency numbers, including that of a lawyer.

Immigration court doesn’t guarantee a lawyer, but a detained person still has the right to speak with one.

“I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Mr. King said.","The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by a federal agent in Minneapolis has set off alarm bells among Republicans, fueling worries within the party about a potential backlash to violent tactics by the Trump administration in its immigration crackdown.

Some Republicans came forward on Sunday to vigorously defend the administration and place blame for the death of the man, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen, on forces on the left who oppose President Trump’s immigration policies. But many party leaders stayed silent, and some G.O.P. lawmakers both in the center and on the hard right raised grave concerns, suggesting a rare moment of dissent over a killing carried out in broad daylight and recorded by bystanders.

Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is facing a primary challenger backed by Mr. Trump, called for a “full joint federal and state investigation” into the fatal shooting of Mr. Pretti, in a statement that called his death “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Mr. Cassidy said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”

Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement on Saturday night that he had requested testimony from the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Even Representative James Comer of Kentucky, a staunch ally of the president’s, appeared to concede that federal agents were killing innocent people in the immigration crackdown, as he suggested on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that Mr. Trump should consider removing ICE agents from Minneapolis and sending them elsewhere.

“If the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way, and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals?’” said Mr. Comer, the chairman of the Oversight Committee.

Their reactions reflected a current of discontent among at least some Republicans about the bare-knuckled tactics of Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown. They are unlikely to signal a sea change in a party that is firmly in the president’s grip, but could indicate a political red flag for the G.O.P. as it fights to maintain control of Congress in midterm elections in November.

A poll from The New York Times and Siena University conducted this month showed that roughly half of voters supported Mr. Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico, but that a sizable majority — 61 percent — believed that ICE’s tactics had gone too far.

“The death of Americans — what we’re seeing on TV — it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, told CNN on Sunday. “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” He said that there was broad agreement with Mr. Trump’s emphasis on sealing the border, but that “he’s getting bad advice right now.”

“We have to enforce federal laws, but we need to know what is the end game,” Mr. Stitt added.

In his own scathing statement, Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, a Republican who has a long record of criticizing and clashing with Mr. Trump, condemned the immigration crackdown, saying it was “at best” a law enforcement failure and “at worst it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”

Prominent gun rights groups who count conservative Republicans among their members also raised concern about the shooting, as did former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote in a lengthy social media post that the right would be outraged if federal agents under the Biden administration had done to a “MAGA supporter” what was done to Mr. Pretti in Minneapolis.

Neither Speaker Mike Johnson nor Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, had commented on the shooting as of Sunday evening, though a senior Senate Republican aide said the party would to push ahead as planned this week with a spending package that would fund the Department of Homeland Security, over the opposition of Democrats.

And some Republicans were publicly digging in, suggesting that the shooting was a tragic but inevitable outcome in a city that declines to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, described the episode as a “tragic shooting in Minnesota where Border Patrol agents used deadly force against an armed protester trying to impede a lawful arrest.”

“It is a direct result of the heated rhetoric and over-the-top reaction toward ICE, who are simply trying to enforce the law in sanctuary cities,” Mr. Graham said. “You have every right to protest and you have every right to disagree with President Trump. No one has the right to impede law enforcement officers carrying out their duties.”

(His account of the shooting was not supported by video of the events.)

But others, including some Republicans from politically safe districts, said they wanted an investigation into the killing and said they were upset by the videos widely circulating that showed that Mr. Pretti was restrained and disarmed before agents fired multiple shots into his back.

Representative Michael Baumgartner, Republican of Washington, said in a statement that he was “disturbed by what I’ve seen from today’s video from Minnesota.”

“It’s critically important that the American people and Congress be given a better understanding of how immigration enforcement is being handled,” Mr. Baumgartner wrote on social media, “including the methods federal law enforcement officers are using to prioritize, identify and arrest suspected targets, the training they are receiving, the implementation of body cameras, the threats they face in conducting operations and the challenges posed by sanctuary cities and states.”

While Mr. Garbarino, the New York Republican who is chairman of the homeland security panel, did not mention Minneapolis in his statement, he said: “I take my oversight duties for the department seriously, and Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Mr. Cassidy’s call for a joint investigation, which came as he is fighting for his political career amid accusations that he has been insufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump, was a break with the Trump administration’s approach. Federal officials had said the Department of Homeland Security would lead the investigation into the shooting and initially blocked Minnesota authorities from examining the scene of the shooting, according to a state official.

Other Republicans who are not seeking re-election, including Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, also endorsed a fuller investigation.

Some conservatives expressed alarm about the administration’s attempts to justify the shooting by noting that Mr. Pretti, who had a license for a concealed firearm, was carrying a pistol when he was killed.

“Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don’t understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,” Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and a libertarian who often clashes with Mr. Trump, wrote on social media.

Senate Democrats had said on Saturday that they would not vote for a spending package needed to avert a government shutdown at the end of the week if it included money for the Department of Homeland Security, and Republicans had considered trying to drop that portion of the deal. But the senior aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans have yet to be announced, said the legislation, which also funds the Pentagon and other programs, would move ahead as one bill, raising the risk of a funding lapse.

Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he “hates” government shutdowns but that he might be forced to back one this week. In November, Mr. King was one of eight senators in the Democratic caucus who broke their party’s blockade and voted with Republicans to advance legislation to end the government shutdown.

“I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Mr. King said.

“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!” he wrote. “By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”

The posts apparently referred to the deaths this month of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two U.S. citizens and Minneapolis residents who were shot and killed by federal immigration agents.

Top Trump administration officials immediately and without evidence accused each of the shooting victims of “domestic terrorism” and said they were seeking to harm federal agents. In both cases, video footage from the scene contradicted the Trump administration’s version of events.

Mr. Trump, in the posts, also called on officials in Democratic-led cities and states to work with immigration authorities by turning over undocumented immigrants who are in state prisons and local jails, and said that Congress should pass legislation to “END Sanctuary Cities.”

He drew a contrast with Republican-led states, including Texas, Florida and Louisiana, where he said that immigration operations had not been met with the same level of opposition.

After a year of gutting the United States government, deploying armed jackboots to American cities, and bombing at least seven countries, the Trump administration kicked off 2026 by invading Venezuela and kidnapping its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores. In the wake of that assault, President Trump doubled down on his abandonment of the isolationist positions he once supposedly held, threatening military action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and Mexico. He then vowed that the U.S. would come to “own” Greenland either “the easy way” or “the hard way.”

In truth, American imperialism defines much of this country’s history, but the latest escalation comes at a time when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have also been deployed around the nation to grab immigrants off the streets and whisk them to detention centers. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to preach the jingoistic gospel of stopping the arrival of new refugees and migrants, while blasting European governments over migration — even as he vows to launch military campaigns that will undoubtedly result in further mass displacements and fleeing people crossing borders in search of safety.

Destabilizing countries the world over and then attacking the people who flee those wars is, of course, nothing new. From the September 11th attacks in 2001 until September 2020, this country’s war on terror, according to one study, displaced an estimated 37 million people in eight countries. And that figure doesn’t even include several million displaced during smaller conflicts the U.S. participated in from Chad to Tunisia, Mali to Saudi Arabia. Nor does it include the number of people displaced by Israel’s five wars since 2008 in and around the Gaza Strip, its land theft in the occupied West Bank, or its frequent airstrikes in Lebanon, Syria, and even Iran, all made possible thanks to Washington’s financial and military support.

When it comes to Washington demonizing the people displaced by its weapons, just ask the Palestinians. Millions of them live strewn across the map of the Middle East and beyond thanks to Israel’s ongoing military occupation and the American tax dollars that have enabled it.

“Eight Lives, Gone Just Like That”

In March 2015, I sat in the back of a taxi bound for Saida, a Lebanese coastal city a little less than an hour south of Beirut. The taxi hummed down the highway, the sea blurring through the windows to our right, and then swerved inland. Saida is more than 30 miles north of the country’s boundary with Israel and some 50 miles west of the border with Syria, but even that deep inside Lebanon, a de facto border appeared in the front windshield. The driver made a series of turns, braked, and inched toward a military checkpoint outside Ain al-Hilweh, a Palestinian refugee camp.

Lebanese soldiers appeared on either side of the vehicle. Their job was to decide who could — and could not — enter the camp. After reading over our documents and ensuring that we had the proper military permission to enter the camp, the soldiers motioned the driver to move forward. We eased in amid a sprawl of ramshackle homes, many built atop one another. It was a dusty, humid day, but people clogged the streets. Children punted a soccer ball back and forth in the road. Motorbikes trembled over potholes. Men stood around in knots, smoking cigarettes and sipping coffee, and some walked by with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders.

Along with an American photographer and a Lebanese reporter, I had gone to Ain al-Hilweh, the largest of Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian camps, to speak to people who had been doubly displaced by the war in neighboring Syria. As that civil war tore through the country — a war that drew interventions from the U.S., Great Britain, France, Israel, Russia, Iran, and several other places — Palestinian refugees from Syria found themselves fleeing to Lebanon. The population of Ain al-Hilweh alone had swelled by tens of thousands.

Of the Palestinians we met that day, the only ones who had ever set foot in their ancestral homeland were those who had been born before — and lived through — the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. What we’d soon learn, however, was that a term like double displacement failed to capture the extent to which borders had governed every aspect of their lives in permanent and repeated exile.

In a corner store with barren shelves, we found Afaf Dashe sitting in a small chair near the counter. At 70 years old, she had survived the Nakba — Arabic for catastrophe, the term Palestinians use to describe the ethnic cleansing of their country since 1948 — as a three-year-old girl when her family fled to Syria. She had grown up in a suburb of Damascus, married, and raised children. When civil war started to rip through Syria in 2011, she and her family gritted it out through four years of barrel bombs, airstrikes, and shelling before they finally escaped.

While Ain al-Hilweh offered some respite, it offered neither true safety nor stability. In Lebanon, decades of state repression, lethal Israeli interventions, and failed Palestinian rebellions had left such refugees particularly vulnerable. Rather than setting down new roots in that dismal camp, Afaf explained, three of her daughters, along with five of her grandchildren, had decided to risk taking the long, often deadly journey to Europe. After crossing from Syria to Lebanon, they parted with Afaf and continued on by sea to Libya. They then paid smugglers to board a boat bound for Italy. As Afaf reached that point in her story, tears gathered in her eyes and she paused, for a long moment staring into the distance, seemingly at nothing, before turning back to us. The boat carrying her family, she said, had capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. “Eight lives, gone just like that. For my whole life, I’ve seen Palestinians move from tragedy to tragedy, and from nakba to nakba.”

More than once in her life, it occurred to me, wars had pushed her, her children, and her grandchildren across borders and, in a distinctly embattled world, borders decided where she and her loved ones could possibly move, where they could live, and where they could die. I thought about the U.S. passport in my pocket, the relative ease with which I had crossed borders throughout my adult life, and the American tax dollars that helped doom Afaf to a life of permanent exile. She would be the first person I met who had lost loved ones simply looking to cross a border to find safety, but by no means the last.

Violent Borders

For tens of millions of people, borders are not merely places where the risk of violence is present. Borders are, by definition, violent. Borders are not merely crossed. Borders must be survived and endured. Borders are not only walls and razor wire. Borders are guards and police, surveillance cameras and drones, batons and bullets. For those tens of millions of people, borders don’t stop where one country ends and the next begins; they stalk and haunt across endless miles and years. Borders are both crime scenes and crimes, with nationalism the motive.

For people forced to flee, the violence doesn’t stop once they escape countries being bombed or economically strangled. The journey itself offers its own slate of dangers. The International Migration Organization has recorded more than 33,200 instances of refugees and migrants dying or going missing in the Mediterranean Sea alone since 2014. Between 1994 and 2024, rights groups estimate that more than 80,000 people died in the deserts or rivers on and around the U.S.-Mexico border.

Throughout the last decade, I’ve traveled along the European refugee trail, stopping off in countries across the Balkans and Central and Western Europe, while also reporting from American communities along the heavily militarized U.S.-Mexico border. Wherever I’ve gone, the displaced have horror stories to tell — of people drowned at sea, of migrants shot along borders, and others who simply disappeared along “the refugee trail.” At a shelter in Belgrade, Serbia, Afghans who had fled the fallout of the U.S. war in their country and walked the endless land route from Turkey spoke of the Bulgarian border police who had detained, threatened, or beaten them along the way. On the Serbian border with Hungary, Moroccans and Algerians told me of policemen who beat their feet with batons to deter them from ever trying to cross the border again. In Greece, young men from Sudan and Somalia — their countries no strangers to U.S. intervention — described the tear gas and rubber bullets they faced on the country’s northern border with Macedonia. In Turkey, Syrians told me about the dogs that Bulgarian border police sicced on them. In Arizona, people recalled walking for so long in the Mexican desert that the soles of their shoes tore apart.

Perhaps more than anything else, the idea of strong borders has fueled the fascist-style surge that now grips the United States and significant parts of Europe. From the time Donald Trump first entered the Oval Office in January 2017, far-right and ultranationalist parties around Europe have also gained ground in ways that would once have been unimaginable — and where the far right has yet to take power, center-left and liberal parties have often swung hard to the right on their immigration and border enforcement policies.

In one breath, even Democratic Party officials in the United States, still singing praises of liberal democracy, are also promising to crack down on immigration and strengthen border enforcement in a desperate bid to appear tougher in the age of Donald Trump. In the United Kingdom, the center-left Labour Party ousted the Conservatives in 2024, only to put into practice anti-immigrant policies that align with those even further to the right, like Nigel Farage and his UK Independence Party. In Greece, even after the violent neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was banned, following years of anti-immigrant violence, the nominally center-right New Democracy Party adopted and repackaged its rhetoric in slightly modified form, while placing a former fascist in charge of its migration ministry. From the United States to Europe, immigration is ever less often discussed as a humanitarian issue and ever more often described in terms of an “invasion,” functionally recasting desperate civilians as armed soldiers.

Politically, the invasion story is more easily digestible than the grim actual stories of displaced people. Unsurprisingly, it has found ever larger audiences. And consider that a grim irony, since so many of the people crossing into the U.S. and Europe, even before they faced deadly journeys at sea and militarized borders, were driven from their countries at least in part due to American and European involvement in mass violence and policies designed to foster economic collapse in their homelands.

Such invasion stories about immigrants are, of course, anything but new, after centuries in which a nationalistic desire for hard borders has undergirded so many claims that war and violence are necessary. In 1908, a decade before she herself was deported from the United States, the Lithuanian-American anarchist Emma Goldman pointed to the violence at the heart of such nationalism during a speech in San Francisco. “Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate,” she told her audience. “Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot consider themselves nobler, better, grander, more intelligent than those living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.”

Hope in the Pushback

In the decade since I started covering migration and borders, I have also witnessed what resistance to the anti-immigrant far right might look like. In Greece, activists and volunteers, anarchists, socialists, and everyday people worked together to do what they could to offer an alternative to the grim realities displaced people were experiencing. On Greek islands like Lesbos, humanitarians gathered by the shore to help the displaced disembark from boats. Others headed out to sea to rescue people from sinking vessels. In Athens, anarchists and other leftists occupied abandoned buildings, refashioning them into squats that displaced immigrants could inhabit without the overcrowding and decrepit living conditions of the official camps. In Germany, everyday people opened their homes to newly arrived refugees. In Austin, Texas, the congregants of a church told me about how they had taken in asylum seekers facing deportation.

And today, Americans in cities from Chicago to Los Angeles have rallied to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration raids. Ever since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis in January, ever more protesters have taken to the streets in growing numbers to voice their opposition to state-sanctioned murder and the Trump administration’s drive to carry out mass deportations fueled more by cruelty than any concern for the country’s safety. As the president deepens federal deployments and threatens to use the military against what he calls the “invasion from within,” those demonstrators undoubtedly understand that their own fates are wrapped up with those of immigrants and refugees. Squats, humanitarian aid, and mass protests may not stop the cruel wheels of the anti-immigrant political machine, but they do offer glimmers of hope at a time when hope is in short supply.

In the early months of 2026, that hope may be needed more than ever, in part because all too many Americans and Europeans continue to empower politicians who recycle the tired argument that, if there were fewer immigrants, life in their countries would be more prosperous and peaceful. In the lead-up to the 2024 election, Donald Trump bluntly assured Americans that immigrants were invaders who were “poisoning the blood of our country.” During the first year of his second term, his administration snatched international students off the streets, separated families, and shipped immigrants off to foreign prisons. Meanwhile, he continued to repeatedly tell Americans that they were being “invaded,” a story that comes with a painful body count, while courting what inevitably loiters behind nationalism and nativism: fear.

In her novel White Teeth, Zadie Smith put all of that in perspective this way: “But it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears — dissolution, disappearance.”

Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimated that more than 122 million people across the world had been displaced as a result of war, violence, or persecution, a number that marked a decade-long high and was also the 10th consecutive year that the total number of people displaced across the globe had increased. Worse yet, war and military campaigns are still driving people from their homes globally.

Sooner than later, such wars and other disasters will result in yet more people seeking safety in Europe and the United States. When that happens, there is little doubt that far-right leaders, hoping to offload the blame for their own failures, will once again stand in front of us and claim that state violence is necessary to protect our country from an “invasion.” Then, you’ll have to make a choice: You can buy into the claim that the most powerful countries on the planet are the victims of invasions or remember that actual invasions and the military campaigns that create lethal cycles of mass displacement are happening in all too many places on this planet. That choice will determine just how much hope there is for a world where desperate people escaping disasters they had no hand in creating don’t have to consider crossing a manmade line a matter of negotiating their very survival.

This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Sarah McCammon. Tensions remain high in Minnesota, where local and federal officials continue to fight over the killing of Alex Pretti. The 37-year-old U.S. citizen and VA nurse was shot dead by federal officers during an immigration enforcement protest in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti's killing has prompted strong bipartisan condemnation today in Congress, a forceful defense from the Trump administration and the prospect of another government shutdown. NPR's Luke Garrett joins us now to explain. Hi, Luke.

LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Hello, Sarah.

SARAH MCCAMMON: Well, let's start in Minneapolis, Luke. What do we know about the investigation into Pretti's killing?

GARRETT: Local and state law enforcement remain at odds with federal officials. The Department of Homeland Security is investigating this deadly shooting, but they're not cooperating or sharing information with those local and state investigators. Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota accused the Trump administration of a, quote, ""cover-up"" Sunday. She told NPR the federal government is ignoring a recent court order that allows state investigators access to the evidence around Pretti's killing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)

TINA SMITH: Our state investigators had to get a warrant to have access to the evidence of the shooting of Alex Pretti. And even then, the federal agents refused to give them access to the evidence.

GARRETT: Now, Smith called on the Trump administration to preserve the evidence and share it with those local and state investigators. And it's worth noting here, Sarah, that three moderate GOP senators echoed this call. Those are Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski went further and called for congressional hearings as well.

SARAH MCCAMMON: And what are we hearing from the Trump administration?

GARRETT: The Trump administration, you know, continues to defend the federal agents who killed Pretti. They also criticized the 37-year-old VA nurse, you know, saying he was, quote, ""perpetrating violence."" Here's the head of President Trump's immigration operation, Border Patrol commander, Greg Bovino, on CNN.

GREG BOVINO: That suspect injected himself into that law enforcement's - into that law enforcement situation with a weapon.

GARRETT: Now Sarah, the video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far refute that assertion. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents. And to be clear, legally carrying a concealed firearm is protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.

SARAH MCCAMMON: OK. So what are gun rights groups saying about this?

GARRETT: So they are taking issue with a post from Trump-appointed U.S. attorney Bill Essayli. He said if a U.S. citizen approaches law enforcement with a gun, federal officers, quote, ""will be legally justified in shooting you."" The gun rights group the NRA, you know, called this post, quote, ""dangerous and wrong."" Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky and frequent Trump critic, went a step further saying Essayli had, quote, ""no business in law enforcement or government.""

SARAH MCCAMMON: So there is bipartisan pushback against this killing and the Trump administration's response. What can Congress actually do?

GARRETT: Well, Senate Democrats are poised to partially shut down the government. The deadline for government funding is Friday, and the Senate still needs to approve the funding for some government departments. One of them is the DHS. After Saturday's killing, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told NBC she just can't vote for the current funding package. Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine have all said they won't vote for it, either. That's notable. They're very moderate Democratic senators as well. So on Saturday, Senate Majority - Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would not vote to advance the spending package if it includes this DHS funding, so it's setting up a fight in Congress.

SARAH MCCAMMON: NPR's Luke Garrett, thanks so much.

Federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, early on Saturday, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway in the Midwestern city, less than three weeks after an immigration officer fired on Renee Good, also 37, killing her in her car.

President Donald Trump's administration quickly claimed that Pretti had intended to harm the federal agents – as it did after Good's death – pointing to a pistol it said was discovered on him. However, video shared widely on social media and verified by US media outlets showed Pretti never drew the weapon, with agents firing around 10 shots at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with chemical irritant and thrown to the ground.

The video further inflamed ongoing protests in Minneapolis against the presence of federal agents, with around 1,000 people participating in a demonstration on Sunday. One person held a cardboard sign that read: ""Be Pretti, be Good.""

Trump slams Minnesota Democratic officials

Trump provocatively attributed the deaths to Minnesota's Democratic elected officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, writing on his Truth Social platform: ""Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE."" ""Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,"" he added.

While administration officials have defended the officer who shot Pretti, Trump in a brief Sunday interview with the Wall Street Journal declined twice to say whether the officer had acted appropriately. ""We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,"" the president told the paper

US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also said an investigation was necessary to get a full understanding of the killing. Asked if agents had already removed the pistol from Pretti when they fired on him, Blanche said: ""I do not know. And nobody else knows, either. That's why we're doing an investigation.""

When asked on Sunday what she would say to Pretti's parents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said: ""Just that I'm grieved for them."" ""I truly am. I can't even imagine losing a child,"" she told Fox News show The Sunday Briefing. She said more clarity would come as an investigation progresses.

'Sickening lies'

After top officials described Pretti as an ""assassin"" who had assaulted the agents, Pretti's parents issued a statement Saturday condemning the administration's ""sickening lies"" about their son.

Barack and Michelle Obama, meanwhile, issued a forceful statement condemning the killing of Pretti by federal agents, saying it exemplified President Trump's ""assault"" on American values. ""The killing of Alex Pretti is a heartbreaking tragedy. It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,"" the former president and first lady said in a joint statement.

Hours later Bill Clinton delivered a fierce indictment of the current administration, saying peaceful protesters ""have been arrested, beaten, teargassed, and most searingly, in the cases of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot and killed."" ""All of this is unacceptable,"" Clinton said in a statement as he urged Americans to ""stand up, speak out."" ""If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.""

'Joint' probe

Their comments came after multiple senators from Trump's Republican Party called for a thorough probe into the killing, and for cooperation with local authorities. ""There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,"" Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said. The Trump administration controversially excluded local investigators from a probe into Good's killing.

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz posed a question directly to the president during a press briefing Sunday, asking: ""What's the plan, Donald Trump?"" ""What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state?""

On Sunday, business leaders from 60 corporations headquartered in Minnesota – including retailer Target, food giant General Mills and several professional sports franchises – signed an open letter ""calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.""

Court order

Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed to heavily Democratic Minneapolis for weeks, after conservative media reported on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants. Trump has repeatedly amplified the racially-tinged accusations, including on Sunday when he posted on his Truth Social platform: ""Minnesota is a Criminal COVER UP of the massive Financial Fraud that has gone on!""

The city, known for its bitterly cold winters, has one of the country's highest concentrations of Somali immigrants. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison pushed back against Trump's claim, telling reporters ""it's not about fraud, because if he sent people who understand forensic accounting, we'd be having a different conversation. But he's sending armed masked men.""

Since ""Operation Metro Surge"" began, many residents have carried whistles to notify others of the presence of immigration agents, while sometimes violent skirmishes have broken out between the officers and protesters. Local authorities have sued the federal government seeking a court order to suspend the operation, with a first hearing set for Monday.

Recent polling has shown voters increasingly upset with Trump's domestic immigration operations, as videos of masked agents seizing people off sidewalks – including children – and dramatic stories of US citizens being detained proliferate.",https://img.lemde.fr/2026/01/25/0/0/8256/5504/1440/960/60/0/652a7f4_ftp-1-jwmujxq72hyo-5987088-01-06.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:20.449016

Senate Democrats are threatening to allow a partial government shutdown next week unless a DHS funding bill is altered with language reining in the agency.

Why it matters: The growing tension could result in a government shutdown, politically charged hearings and even an impeachment vote.

More and more Democrats are signing onto Rep. Robin Kelly's (D-Ill.) articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, with Kelly's office telling Axios they expect a surge in co-sponsors in the coming day.

Senate Democrats are threatening to allow a partial government shutdown next week unless a DHS funding bill is altered with language reining in the agency.

And Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, has asked the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to testify to his panel.

Driving the news: While many Republican leaders and loyal Trump allies leapt to DHS' defense in the wake of the shooting, a noticeably large group of GOP lawmakers offered more equivocal statements than in the aftermath of the Renee Good shooting weeks earlier.

Many centered their responses on calling for a full investigation, including Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), Jon Husted (R-Ohio), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.), Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas).

The office of Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.), a staunch conservative and Trump ally, said in a statement: ""Leaders at every level must lower the temperature, enforce the law, and protect public safety. In the days ahead, we will work to ensure a full and transparent review of events.""

""Law enforcement should conduct an objective investigation and get the facts. We defend people's free speech and right to protest,"" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a statement to Axios, though he added that it is ""not right to interfere or obstruct law enforcement in their official actions.""

Zoom in: The responses of Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) to two different shootings in her home state offer a revealing picture of how the GOP's tone has shifted since the start of the year.

After Renee Good was killed on Jan. 7, Fischbach called the incident a ""targeted assault on ICE agents"" in a post on X, writing, ""I stand with the officer who acted in self-defense to save lives.""

On Sunday, she wrote after Pretti was killed: ""I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in Minneapolis and fully support the ongoing investigation into this incident.""

Between the lines: Some Republicans also broke with the administration for saying Pretti should not have had a gun on him.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) write on X that ""ICE should not leave Minnesota"" but that ""carrying a gun & magazines is not an invitation for cops to shoot you.""

""Fighting cops (esp. w/ a gun) might be,"" he added.

The other side: DHS still had a semblance of Democratic support on Capitol Hill before the shooting, but what little was left appears to have evaporated.

Rep. Laura Gillen (D-N.Y.), one of the seven swing-district centrists who voted to pass a DHS funding bill last week, signed on as a co-sponsor to Kelly's articles of impeachment.

Even some support from senators began to trickle in on Sunday, with centrist Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) calling for Noem's impeachment.

The articles of impeachment stood at Democratic 120 co-sponsors as of Sunday evening — well over half of the 213 Democrats in the House. Kelly can force them to a vote, though it is not clear if and when she plans to do that.

What to watch: The most immediate impact of the shooting will be in the Senate, where a package of six spending bills is now in significant peril.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said this weekend that Democrats won't vote for the DHS funding bill.

The package would also fund a huge portion of the federal government beyond DHS, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Transportation and Labor.

RASCOE: Well, what are some of the long-term implications of Trump's aggressive posture toward U.S. allies?","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Joining us now is NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Welcome.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.

RASCOE: So, you know, as you just heard, there's a lot we don't know about the shooting yesterday in Minneapolis. But what strikes you politically about this?

LIASSON: One thing that strikes me is how the Trump administration tries to get out immediately after these incidents with a narrative that may or may not be true. This happened with the shooting of Renee Macklin Good just a few weeks ago, when the administration said she carried out an act of domestic terrorism. Trump called her a professional agitator, accused Good of trying to run over the ICE agent who shot her, before there was an investigation or much evidence of this.

We're also seeing some pushback from Congress. Senate Democrats say they will not vote for the Department of Homeland Security's funding bill. And all this occurs at a time when Trump's approval ratings are dropping. Immigration has been the aspect of Trump's policies that was the most popular. Voters in general approve of his efforts to secure the Southern border and to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

But new polls show that a majority of voters disapprove of ICE's tactics. Now, a New York Times poll taken right before the second fatal shooting shows that majorities of voters disapprove of the way ICE is doing its job. Only 36% of voters approve, and 61% said ICE had, quote, ""gone too far."" Now, this could have an impact on the midterm elections, even though Trump himself is not on the ballot.

RASCOE: I want to - you know, moving on another topic. I want to ask you about yet another tariff threat from President Trump. He's now saying he'll impose a hundred-percent tariff if Canada moves ahead with the trade deal with China. Is this fallout over Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's remarks at Davos last week?

LIASSON: It seems like it. Carney gave a very candid speech, laying out what he called a rupture in the world order. He encouraged middle countries like his and other NATO allies to work more independently, saying they can't rely on the U.S. anymore as a stabilizing force. That speech got a standing ovation. Donald Trump didn't like it at all, and then he threatened the 100% tariffs on Canada.

And the trade deal that Canada made with China - where they agreed to lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles, China agreed to lower tariffs on some Canadian agriculture products - interestingly enough, Trump was for it. He seems to have reversed himself. When the deal was announced last week, he said it was a good thing. He said, it's what you should be doing. He said, quote, ""if you can get a deal with China, you should do that."" But then he changed his mind. He now is attacking Carney for being ungrateful. And the bottom line here is that Donald Trump is very unpredictable.

RASCOE: Well, and given that he reverses himself so much over tariffs, are these threats kind of losing their punch?

LIASSON: Well, they could be. He does have a pattern of blustering then backing down. This is something termed the TACO theory for Trump always chickens out. And some of these threats seem to be performative for Trump. At times, he sounds like he's in a ""Godfather"" movie. Take a listen to what he said during his speech at Davos where he tried to coerce Denmark and other U.S. allies to give the United States control of Greenland.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.

LIASSON: And I think it's apt that the term TACO came originated with Wall Street traders because the markets seem to be the last guardrails on Trump's behavior. When he threatened force to take Greenland, when he threatened to put tariffs on U.S. allies, the markets tumbled. Then when he backed off, the markets bounced back. But the bottom line again is, the whole - his behavior is so unpredictable, and it makes some sort of sense that other countries - even long-term US allies - are now looking to find their own path and make deals with other superpowers like China.

RASCOE: Well, what are some of the long-term implications of Trump's aggressive posture toward U.S. allies?

LIASSON: They could be profound. If the Western alliance permanently ruptures, the implications could be very big. Article 5 of NATO says, an attack on one member is an attack on all. All protect each other. But Donald Trump has called that into question, raising doubts about whether he would come to Europe's aid if it was invaded by Russia.

And the question hanging over Europe right now is, if the alliance does rupture, is it possible for Europe to rearm itself to make up for losing the U.S. as an ally? Does Europe have the means or the will to do this, to make up for the intelligence and the weapon systems and the nuclear umbrella that they get from the United States? Estimates are that it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars and take decades.

So this is a big question. There really isn't an alternative to the Western alliance for European countries. And in the meantime, Russia is happy to see these divisions. Vladimir Putin has been trying to break the Western alliance for his entire life, and right now, he's watching it break apart possibly from the inside, so this is a big gift to Putin and a lot of uncertainty for European countries going forward.

RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara.

LIASSON: Thank you.

She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.
7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.
It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents.","Following the killing of Minnesota nurse Alex Pretti at the hands of a Border Patrol officer on Saturday, Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates are now laying out their plans on how to deal with increasingly violent federal immigration enforcement actions that have resulted in three shootings in three weeks, with two now ending in death.

Local and state Democratic officials in Minnesota immediately condemned Saturday’s shooting as protests ramped up, while Republican President Donald Trump threatened again to send military forces to Minnesota, according to reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, Minnesota Reformer.

In Michigan, the three Democrats in the Senate race followed suit, but they each have slightly different policy contemplations to either rein in, curb or abolish the executive branch’s increasingly troubling immigration force.

Former health official and Bernie Sanders-wing progressive Abdul El-Sayed has called for the outright dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position he’s held since 2018, a message he has amplified in the wake of the government killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7.

“The murderers of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were eight-year and ten-year agents — training isn’t the issue,” El-Sayed said in a statement issued Sunday. “ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against and our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot? Ask the families of Renee Good or Alex Pretti — both American Citizens — if ICE is protecting us. There can be no justification for lawlessness in the name of the law. And now is not the time to put political convenience. Trump is trying to normalize military force on peaceful streets, tearing apart our constitutional rights one by one. Our tax dollars are being used to kill Americans on our streets rather than save lives in our hospitals like Alex did.”

El-Sayed added that the U.S. must work to secure its border and work toward comprehensive immigration reform through legislation, and not through continued executive action. ICE, in that regard, has been shown to be “irredeemable,” he said.

“Retraining won’t fix it,” El-Sayed said. “And the only reason to deny this is political cowardice. … Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

While El-Sayed stated his belief that this stance sets him apart from his opponents, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) has called for denying further funding for ICE and has demanded the immediate and sweeping overhaul of the agency. She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.

“Another person was killed by ICE in Minneapolis, after state leaders told them to leave, local officials told them to leave, and local law enforcement told them to leave,” McMorrow said in a statement on Saturday. “But Trump’s ICE continues on its collision course making our communities LESS safe — not more. Congress: not one more penny until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”

McMorrow and her Democratic colleagues in the Michigan Senate are working on a game plan to respond to ICE tactics in the Great Lakes state, and that includes legislation prohibiting officers from being masked on operations with full identification. News that ICE has been distributing memos indicating that the agency does not need a judicial warrant — but rather a Fourth Amendment-bucking administrative warrant signed by an ICE official — has also led state Democrats to consider banning entry by law enforcement without a warrant.

McMorrow has also called for strict, codified use-of-force policies on the federal level to give courts a clear line for when an officer has abused their station if it ends in a preventable violent encounter. Vetting of recruits and vigorous training is part of McMorrow’s plan, as well as a demand that ICE stop detaining American citizens.

“Continuing to provide funding to this agency without a complete overhaul to return it to its duty will be a failure to meet the moment,” McMorrow said in a statement released prior to the death of Pretti this weekend. “The leverage is there. And Democrats should force Republicans to the table to demand that Congress use its power of the purse to end this nightmare and restore the community safety that Americans are demanding.”

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Sunday said she was joining as a co-sponsor for H.R. 7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.

The bill would hire and train an estimated 200,000 local police officers across the nation, reverting funds to what Stevens called “proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.”

“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control — this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” Stevens said in a statement. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”

Other aspects of the bill include:

Reallocating $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions); and

Reallocating $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens voted against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which did pass in the U.S. House last week, and last year co-sponsored the VISIBLE Act to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities. Stevens has also called for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to be removed from office and co-sponsored articles for Noem’s impeachment.

What about Republicans?

The main Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, as of Sunday afternoon, had not issued a direct statement on the killing of Pretti. Rogers, who is endorsed by Trump, did issue several statements following the killing of Good, saying Democrats, and more specifically his Democratic opponents in the race, were persistently supporting “criminals over cops and America’s safety.”

“The Left’s never-ending war against law enforcement is an assault on Americans’ safety,” Rogers said in a statement issued Jan. 22. “These brave men and women protect our streets so that Michigan families can drive to work and walk to school without fear. But when you have Democrats releasing violent offenders onto the streets, and siding with criminals over cops, that all goes out the window.”

The only other Republican in the race, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Bernadette Smith, has not issued any public statement on either Pretti or Good’s deaths.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7744-2048x1536-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:02.727687

BG Independent News

As Americans watch ICE agents sweep into cities in Democratic states, some wonder who will be next. If ICE were to show up in this region, what rights do immigrants have? And what role can bystanders play legally?

To answer those questions, a “Build the Nest” training was hosted last week by LaConexion of Wood County, a non-profit community-based organization bringing unity, voice and representation to the immigrant community in the Northwest Ohio region.

The training was led by Mechelle Zarou, an attorney serving immigrant and refugee families in Northwest Ohio, and Brittany Ford from Welcome Toledo-Lucas County.

“We are building a nest of protection for immigrants across the state,” Ford explained.

Making immigrants and citizens aware of their rights has become rather complicated in the past year since the federal government is ignoring some long-standing constitutional human rights.

“We really have no pathway to legal immigration to the U.S.,” Ford said. There is no refugee or asylum system anymore – “unless you’re a white Afrikaner.”

“When we created these materials, we were in a very different world,” Zarou said.

The brutality seen in Minneapolis the last few weeks has shaken up faith in the rights people previously relied upon, she said.

“Everyone has rights,” Zarou said. “We’re holding them (ICE) accountable for following the law.”

Here are some tips offered for those who may encounter ICE:

If you are stopped on a street or in a public place, you have rights under the 5th Amendment to remain silent. Arrests cannot legally be made without warrants, unless ICE agents have reason to believe you have committed a crime – other than just being brown. In Ohio, while people are required to give police their name, address and date of birth – there is no requirement to answer questions about citizenship.

Carry the small “Know Your Rights” wallet-sized card with you. It states your rights as a human being. They are available with English writing on one side, and 18 different languages on the other.

Use your 4th Amendment rights to not give authorities permission to enter your home – unless they have a warrant signed by a judge or magistrate with your name on it. ICE has been using battering rams to violate that Constitutional right, Zarou said. “They should be held to comply with the law just like we are,” she said.

Ask to speak to an attorney. Since ICE is likely to confiscate your phone, have a phone number memorized for a legal aid attorney.

If you speak a language other than English, you have the right to an interpreter, as part of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. “Which hasn’t been rescinded yet,” Ford said.

Don’t sign anything without your attorney present. No matter how much pressure is exerted, do not sign paperwork that may be seen as a waiver of rights or an agreement to deportation. “There’s a lot of tricks being played,” Zarou said.

Do not lie to immigration enforcement since that could be used as reason for deportation. “Under no circumstances should anyone give false information,” Zarou said.

Detained immigrants have the right to ask to be released on bond.

In preparation for encounters with ICE, immigrants should collect and copy important documents. Zarou – who hopes this still holds true in America – does not recommend carrying your passport in public.

Make plans for temporary guardians for your children if it becomes necessary.

Ford and Zarou also talked about how local residents can be effective bystanders, offering support and documenting incidents legally.

Confrontations with ICE agents are often “highly charged situations,” so it’s important that bystanders not interfere, Zarou said. However, citizens are in no way required to help ICE enforce immigration laws.

“You can be a good bystander in a lot of different ways,” she said. For example:

Bystanders can lawfully videotape ICE officers. That has put some citizens at risk in some communities. So if videotaping is too scary, use your phone to record audio.

As soon as the incident is over, write down everything you witnessed right away, while it’s still fresh in your memory. “Eyewitness testimony still means something,” Zarou said.

If you witness someone being detained by ICE, you can advise that person to remain silent.

You can volunteer to deliver groceries to immigrant families who fear leaving their homes, or offer help with their children if the adults are detained.

“Safe spaces,” like churches should have some spaces labeled as “private” where ICE agents cannot legally enter.

During the meeting, Pastor Jeff Schooley asked if Bowling Green City Council could establish some local rules for ICE agents – such as not allowing facial masks, requiring body-cameras and limiting how local police assist ICE.

While some communities have taken such actions, the federal government is ignoring local ordinances, Ford and Zarou said. And declarations of “sanctuary city” status have made some communities targets for the federal government.

Ford also shared data about immigrants in Ohio. In 2023, there were approximately 550,000 living in the state – about 4.7% of the population. Many of them filled positions as physicians, professors, and STEM professions. Asians made up the largest percentage of immigrants, at 42%.

Ohio’s population grew from 2023-2024 – only due to immigrants, Ford said.

In 2024, immigrants paid total taxes of $7 billion in Ohio. “We need immigrants,” Ford said.",https://bgindependentmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-BGIN_logo_blue_square_300px-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:57:47.159363

Minnesotans shot – and even killed – at the hands of federal agents.

U.S. citizens arrested by masked officers in broad daylight.

These headlines should be enough to make anyone rethink their support of President Donald Trump’s immigration agencies.

The death of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday – caught on camera from multiple angles — must finally shock this country’s lawmakers into action.

The country is horrified by abuses committed using hundreds of millions in tax dollars. According to a recent survey from Data for Progress, 55% of voters think any increased funding for immigration enforcement agencies is a bad use of taxpayer money. New York Times polling released on Friday, meanwhile, found that 61% of people believe ICE’s tactics have “gone too far.”

Voters who watched yet another American protester shot down in the middle of a Minneapolis street are looking to Congress to rein in ICE. And senators currently hold the fate of ICE and Border Patrol funding in their hands.

This week, the Senate is meeting to vote on six government funding bills ahead of a Jan. 30 government shutdown deadline. If Congress now renews the ICE budget with no strings attached, it will become complicit in the violence, violations of rights, and chaos ICE is fomenting every day.

Thankfully, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seems to understand the urgency of this moment. The minority leader vowed on Saturday night to oppose any funding package that includes DHS funding. There can be no business as usual for DHS at a time when it is rampaging through communities, wreaking havoc and inflicting physical and constitutional violence.

Senators have worked hard to negotiate bipartisan compromise spending bills (no easy feat), and they should go ahead and pass the five bills funding other departments. But any bill that would fund ICE and Border Patrol without any meaningful limits is effectively endorsing the conduct of rogue agencies that are causing indelible harm to people across the country, including many U.S. citizens. No senator should want that on their record or their conscience.

ICE is randomly stopping people who appear Black or Brown, including off-duty cops – and demanding they show proof of citizenship. Small business owners who were able to survive the Covid-19 pandemic now worry about how they’ll survive ICE’s Operation Metro Surge, with customers too afraid to leave their homes.

Alex Pretti and Renee Good were shot by federal agents at point blank range. They should both be alive today.

But the shootings weren’t the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, nor the end.

Within 72 hours of Good’s death, over 1,000 protests sprung up across the country. That’s not an aberration. According to at least one survey, a majority of American voters watched the video of her killing. Many, it seems, were horrified. This weekend, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said some 15,000 people braved subzero temperatures to peacefully demand ICE get out of their city.

Last Tuesday, a medical examiner ruled that the death of a 55-year-old man detained at Fort Bliss, Texas – the former Japanese internment camp repurposed as part of ICE’s deportation machine – was a homicide, due to asphyxiation; ICE officials initially called it a suicide.

More from MS NOW Daily

Must reads from Today's list

Just a few days ago, federal agents detained Liam Conejo Ramos – a 5-year-old preschool student – in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. Local school officials claim ICE vehicles are tailing school buses and trying to enter school grounds.

On top of that, a leaked Department of Homeland Security memo showed that the department has been telling ICE agents it’s OK to break down doors and force their way into homes without a judicial warrant. The Fourth Amendment was written to protect us from exactly this: heavily armed government forces invading our property at gunpoint, and on their own say-so.

These agencies are also attacking our First Amendment right to speak out. People who simply videotape agents’ behavior, stand on sidewalks, pray in front of ICE facilities, or watch these masked and armed agents are facing gas and pepper balls, as well as seemingly indiscriminate arrests and physical assault.

Now the Senate has an opportunity to put its foot down. Some will fret about another funding fight after the bruising, record-breaking shutdown in the fall. But this situation is completely different. The question is not whether to use government funding as leverage to accomplish a policy aim. The question is whether the funding Congress is considering for DHS will be used to violate the law, and our rights.

There’s a long list of things Congress should insist on before ICE and Border Patrol get another dime. For example, ICE needs to end warrantless arrests and home invasions without judicial warrants. Border Patrol needs to stop policing our cities. And the administration must turn over all evidence and witnesses related to the killings of Good and Pretti to Minnesota investigators.

Last week, the ACLU’s polling showed that 54% of voters oppose any increased budget for ICE’s enforcement and detention budget. And 65% support Congress holding rogue agencies and officers accountable for constitutional violations, using something like the proposed Bivens Act to do so.

Everywhere ICE goes with its lawless dragnets and wanton violence, communities suffer. Kids stay home from school. Businesses lose employees and customers. Citizens and legal residents are harassed and asked to “show their papers,” arrested, and even locked up because of the color of their skin or their language or their accent. And of course, thousands of people have been terrorized, traumatized, ripped away from their families — and sometimes — tragically killed.

The American people don’t want to live in this kind of police state.

Senators should listen. And then do something about it.","https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769313332/260124-federal-agents-mn-mbs_1159417b56e0_1159417cd550_1159417661d6/260124-federal-agents-mn-mbs_1159417b56e0_1159417cd550_1159417661d6.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1",N,,2026-01-25 22:58:07.890306

On Saturday night, Minnesotans gathered in candlelight vigils on street corners in our neighborhoods to mourn and remember Pretti.","On Friday, hours before Shabbat began, I was arrested with 96 other multifaith clergy members and Faith in Minnesota leaders while protesting ICE in Minneapolis.

“Who could have imagined such times as these?” we sang, in the words of local songmaker Sarina Partridge. “We will grieve through these times, and soon enough we’ll be grieving on the other side.”

We cannot keep on with business as usual when our federal government is engaged in escalating state terror right here, right now. To grieve through these times is not enough; we must also act.

In the bitter cold, thousands of Minnesotans gathered at that airport. Tens of thousands more marched downtown, and others simply stayed home in the largest work stoppage in this country in many decades, the Day of Truth and Freedom. Nearly one thousand interfaith clergy answered the call to come to Minnesota — as they did for the Civil Rights Movement call to march in Selma in 1965 — to join us in the fight.

Standing there among them, on erev shabbes in the cold, I thought about the Torah portion we would read the next morning in shul: parashat Bo, from the Book of Exodus.

In it, the darkness of the ninth plague that befell the Egyptians is described as something that the oppressors — the mitzrim, which I’ll translate as “the ones of narrowed sight” — could actually touch. It was so thick that it kept them isolated from each other, unable to move.

In contrast, the dwellings of those seeking liberation were full of light.

I imagined that palpable darkness not as a punishment, but as a reflection of reality. The oppressors were unwilling to see the humanity of their neighbors. But if they had been, they too could have found themselves in dwellings full of light, able to clearly perceive the richness and possibility of living in a multiethnic community.

So too with the federal oppressors here in Minnesota, and those who collude with them. They are so welcome to join us in the light of that recognition. We were there at the airport to invite them in.

Instead, they arrested nearly 100 of us, while we sang and prayed for the protection of our people in the languages of our diverse traditions. Doing this work in coalition builds the power we need to break through the oppression: Our differences make us stronger.

As a minister next to me chanted the Lord’s Prayer, and a clergy member close by meditated with closed eyes, I chimed in with “Ana Bekoach,” a kabbalistic prayer that is part of Friday night services, envisioning divine protection holding close all the people of this place.

At our airport, Signature Aviation is facilitating the internment of our fellow Minnesotans every day, adults and children alike, flying them to detention centers where they suffer in conditions that deny their humanity. ICE is even disappearing workers at that airport from the jobs they work every day, keeping all of us safe and supported as we travel.

The airport is supposed to encourage connection. Come join us in our city, it is supposed to say; come see the beauty of our communities. Come, with your eyes open, to join a dwelling of light. Instead, it has turned into a hub of darkness, and separation.

As Jews, so many aspects of our history are particularly resonant in this moment.

As ICE has engaged in a campaign of terror in our city since the start of the year, I have heard Jews in my community reflecting on their families’ experiences with state terror in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and under dictatorships in Latin America. We join neighbors, refugees and immigrants from around the world, who never thought those feelings of suffocating fear would again define their lives here in the United States.

Now that they are, our obligation is to resist.

I was moved to tears during a march last week, when I saw families in hiding peeking out from behind their attic blinds as we sang of our love for our immigrant neighbors. It reminded me of Jewish families reduced to hiding in Nazi Germany, and of those brave souls who tried to protect them.

When I was arrested, I felt my heart open to the clergy standing and kneeling together with me, and all those in our state who have stood up with courage and generosity throughout these weeks and months. I hoped that all those who would see or hear of our arrest would be motivated to join this work.

The safety of all marginalized communities in this country, our Jewish community included, depends on our efforts to protect our democratic practices, and one another. You can join us, in Minnesota, or wherever you are.

Call for ICE to get out of Minnesota. Their presence is endangering us all. Just yesterday, Alex Jeffrey Pretti — an ICU nurse, mountain bike enthusiast, dog lover and beloved community member — was shot and killed by federal agents while attempting to aid a fellow protester. Our government, rather than accept responsibility for the injustice of his death, and that of Renée Nicole Good, is already lying about who these upstanding Minnesotans were and what those agents did.

Learn from us and protect each other in your home communities. You can stand with Minnesota; we’ll stand with you too. Call your senators to demand that they deny ICE funding in an upcoming vote this week. Push for prosecution of ICE agents who kill our civilians. Together we will fight the plague of narrow sight, instead creating dwellings of warm light where we hold and honor the fullness of humanity of each and every one of us.

On Saturday night, Minnesotans gathered in candlelight vigils on street corners in our neighborhoods to mourn and remember Pretti. I was with hundreds of my students on campus. We imagined, together, all the vigil-goers, holding candles to decry Pretti’s death and honor his memory, as points of light, linked across Minnesota and the country, and around the world.",https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-minneapolis-clergy-protest-airport-rabbi-arrested-GettyImages-2257689256.jpg?_t=1769384216,N,,2026-01-25 19:57:30.967811

The impromptu march that the organization Hands Off and the New York Immigration Coalition called on Jan. 24 was sparked by several gruesome viral videos that showed multiple masked federal agents in Minneapolis shooting protester Alex Pretti multiple times. Pretti, an ICU nurse, had come to the aid of a woman whom agents knocked down before ICE members turned their attention to him — wrestling him to the ground and pummeling him with their fists.

One of the agents then grabbed what appeared to be a holster with a gun from Pretti’s waist; multiple reports indicated that he had a license to carry the weapon in Minnesota. After the gun was taken, multiple ICE agents fired shots at Pretti, killing him.

The videos contradicted multiple narratives from the Department of Homeland Security, its secretary, Kristi Noem, and others who claimed that Pretti had confronted them first with a gun and threatened the agents’ lives.

However, the released videos do not appear to show Pretti holding a firearm; instead, the weapon appears to be concealed in his waistband. Local police say Pretti has no criminal history aside from traffic violations and did have a permit for the weapon, as required by state law.

Meanwhile, in the Big Apple, elected officials denounced the slaying. Mayor Zohran Mamdani wasted little time in again calling for the dismantling of the immigration enforcement agency.

“As tens of thousands across America protest the violence that ICE sows with impunity, federal agents shot and killed another person in Minneapolis today. ICE terrorizes our cities. ICE puts us all in danger. Abolish ICE,” Mamdani wrote on X.

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also took to social media to demand fellow elected officials vote to cut funding to ICE.

“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny.DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence. They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Immigration rights advocates, like the Immigration Coalition and Hands Off NYC, called an emergency protest in Union Square on Saturday to stand in solidarity with Minneapolis and to demand that ICE be withdrawn from the state and that operations in New York cease.

“This is not normal — no one should be killed for protecting their neighbors. No one should be killed for standing up to masked agents who are abducting people off the streets.

Minneapolis, MN — National Immigration Project Executive Director Sirine Shebaya issued the following statement on the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minnesota:

Over the weekend in Minneapolis, federal immigration enforcement officers publicly executed a peaceful observer. We mourn the senseless killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who worked at a Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, gunned down by a U.S. Border Patrol agent. This marks the second fatal federal shooting in Minneapolis in less than three weeks.

When federal officers repeatedly kill people on our streets, it is not a failure of policy; it is the policy. This is a system that has abandoned human life, constitutional limits, and basic accountability. With a $170 billion military-style budget, Congress has enabled a massive federal enforcement operation that uses taxpayer dollars to inflict brutality on the American people and treats constitutional rights as a nuisance, not protections.

The National Immigration Project calls for:

ICE operations to end everywhere;

Full legal accountability for any use of force by federal immigration officers;

No funding for ICE or other Department of Homeland Security agencies;

An end to warrantless arrests and arrests based on racial profiling;

Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors.","This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

On Thursday, I ended my day on daycare patrol as the windchill crept close to 25 degrees below zero. The patrols began after ICE appeared at my son’s daycare two weeks ago; that same day, a daycare worker for the same provider was taken by agents at a nearby location while trying to get in to work. During my recent patrol, ICE agents were spotted in the neighborhood, as they nearly always are, but everybody made it out of the building safely.

As I write this, a helicopter is circling over my neighborhood, as happens most days now. My phone is pinging near constantly with alerts from Signal groups that exist to defend and support our community. A friend texted to ask how concerned we should be that the president will invoke the Insurrection Act and send the military into our city; my husband just learned that workers at a nearby small business were taken by the government; a friend’s school went on lockdown today because ICE was nearby.

Our neighborhood has never been more united, but you wouldn’t know it from how few people are out on the streets. Nobody opens their door anymore, knowing that the next knock might be a federal agent demanding to know where the Brown people live in your neighborhood. People are making a point to support immigrant-owned restaurants, but you have to check if they’re open before you go, because so many aren’t. Folks are out delivering food and essentials to neighbors who are unable to leave their homes for fear, but they have to be careful to use a different car than they drive when they’re observing ICE, because the government is tracking license plates.

Earlier this week, students in our city lost two days of learning because schools closed—the teachers needed time to shift to the virtual learning model which began on Thursday. This time, it’s not because of an unknown and deadly illness; it’s because the government is attacking our students. People are being shipped out of the state so fast that their families don’t have time to get to their holding cell with the paperwork proving they’re legally authorized to be here before they’re gone.

The horrors have not ceased since Renee Good’s death, instead they have increased. Protestors are being attacked and shot. On Tuesday, a five-year-old was detained by ICE and used to bait his family into leaving their home. The preschooler and his father have now been sent to Texas, and it is unclear if or when they’ll return. On Thursday, multiple civil rights leaders, including Saint Paul Public School board member Chauntyll Allen, were arrested for exercising their First Amendment right to protest, in a DOJ action that the NAACP has said was a likely violation of First Amendment rights. And on Saturday, Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents, shot multiple times at close range. Every day, there is a new horror to process, a new way in which the federal government inflicts irreparable harm on our community.

I serve as a Saint Paul City Councilmember, and our community is under a violent attack at the hands of the federal government. And so we are fighting back in all the ways we know how.

On January 12th, Saint Paul announced a joint lawsuit with the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota against the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to end this unconstitutional operation. Our City Council is working to strengthen our separation ordinance and develop other legal tools to make certain that our city resources—including our police department—cannot and will not support the work of immigration enforcement. We are calling on the governor to declare a state of emergency and enact a state-wide eviction moratorium to ensure that nobody loses their home because the federal government is making it impossible for them to earn a living. Every elected official in our city is working to connect our residents with whatever support they need right now. We are also demanding that Congress act—that our representatives and senators use every tool at their disposal to end this occupation—because neither cities nor states alone have enough tools to protect our people from the federal government.

None of this feels like enough. Individually, none of it is. But what we know from other countries that have successfully defeated authoritarianism is that democratic resurgence is possible. Over the last 30 years, 52 percent of “autocratization episodes” were followed by democratic resurgence. In 90 percent of those cases, countries were ultimately as or more democratic than they were previously.

In Saint Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win. We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day. We are demonstrating our commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of incredible levels of violence being used against us. We might get tired, but we are not succumbing to despair. Our civil resistance movement is strong, and it is growing.

Most importantly, we know what we’re fighting for, because we’ve already lived it. Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors. Minnesota has always been at its best when we’ve built structures that allow everybody in our state to flourish, whether they’ve been here for months or for generations. This is a place where we take seriously Paul Wellstone’s immortal words that “we all do better when we all do better.” The cruel, painful world that Donald Trump is trying to force on us is not one that we will ever, ever settle for. The path ahead is not clear, but we will continue to put one foot in front of the other until the day we win.",https://compote.slate.com/images/e0fbca6f-121d-4eeb-9e26-545a0e2c0315.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:49.120156

We have lost a fellow registered nurse to an act of violence connected to immigration enforcement.","The largest organization of registered nurses in the United States, National Nurses United (NNU), has called for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital, was shot multiple times by ICE agents during an anti-immigration operation on Saturday.

NNU, representing over 225,000 members, expressed outrage, stating, “The nation’s nurses are horrified that immigration agents have committed cold-blooded murder against a public servant who posed no threat. We demand justice and accountability for his murder.”

The incident marks the third shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis this month, following the deaths of Renee Good and another individual during arrests.

On January 7, 37-year-old US citizen Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent. Another ICE agent, on January 14, shot a Venezuelan national in the leg during arrest.

NNU criticized the Trump administration’s crackdown, declaring that ICE poses a serious public health threat. They emphasized that ICE agents have repeatedly shown violence, stating, “They have kidnapped hardworking people and now murdered a trusted nurse.”

The American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Minnesota Organization of Registered Nurses (MNORN) also issued statements expressing sorrow and demanding transparency in the investigation.

We are “deeply disturbed and saddened to learn of the death of Alex Pretti, a registered nurse, in Minneapolis earlier today. We extend our condolences to Alex’s loved ones, colleagues, and the community at large,"" ANA said in a statement.

ANA added that it condemned violence and demanded accountability and transparency in investigating and determining the cause of the incident.

""The seriousness of this incident and others demands transparency and accountability. ANA calls for a full, unencumbered investigation, and urges that findings be shared promptly and clearly so Alex’s loved ones and the public have answers,” it emphasized in its statement.

Meanwhile, MNORN expressed heartfelt grief over the loss.

""Today, our nursing community is grieving. We have lost a fellow registered nurse to an act of violence connected to immigration enforcement. Regardless of where each of us stands on the issues surrounding this moment, the loss of a nurse, a caregiver, a colleague, a human being cuts us deeply. This message is not about politics. It is about mourning a life taken too soon and honoring the calling we all share,"" MNORN stated,

""Please be gentle with yourselves and with one another in the days ahead. Check in on each other. Allow room for sorrow, confusion, and reflection. If you are struggling, please reach out, no one needs or should carry this alone…When one nurse is lost, all of us feel it,"" MNORN added.

Pretti’s family condemns accusations

Pretti’s family condemned accusations labeling him a ""domestic terrorist,"" asserting he was unarmed during the incident. They described him as a compassionate individual deeply concerned for others.

Pretti’s family said they are ""heartbroken but also very angry"" over the agent's killing of Alex, a Democratic voter who had taken part in woke protests.

Alex's father, Michael Pretti, told AP that Alex viewed participating in protests as a way to express his care for others. His parents described him as a compassionate person, “deeply concerned about people.”

His parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful. ""We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,"" Alex told his father.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed the shooting occurred during a targeted operation against an armed individual, asserting that an agent fired in self-defense.

Protests erupted in Minneapolis on Saturday, calling for justice and opposing federal enforcement actions, prompting Governor Tim Walz to activate the Minnesota National Guard for local law enforcement support.

Protesters gathered near the location of the latest shooting, and tensions rose in parts of the city. Federal agents used crowd-control measures, including tear gas and flash bangs, after confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement personnel.

Governor Walz authorized the activation of the Minnesota National Guard to assist local law enforcement at the request of the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office.

Walz said he had communicated with the White House, stressing that the investigation should be led by the state.

""The state has the personnel to keep people safe -- federal agents must not obstruct our ability to do so,"" Walz said on X.",https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2026/1/25/85d40adb-c874-4beb-961c-534d9ab9effb.JPG,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:45.214447

Local officials have disputed administration officials' claims that the shootings were acts of self-defense, citing bystander video that appears to contradict the government’s accounts.

Here is a look at the potential legal repercussions for the officers.

WHAT HAPPENED?

An ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good in her car on January 7. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer had fired ""defensive shots"" after Good attempted to run him over, though online videos of the shooting verified by Reuters cast doubt on the government's narrative.

ICE agents shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in a separate incident on January 24. DHS said Pretti approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, though bystander videos verified by Reuters show Pretti - whom Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said carried a handgun lawfully - holding a phone as he tries to help protesters whom agents pushed to the ground.

WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?

Minnesota’s use-of-force law permits state police to use deadly force only if reasonable officers would believe doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, from death or serious harm.

Federal law has a similar standard, permitting use of deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury.

COULD THE OFFICERS BE PROSECUTED?

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties. Immunity only applies when an officer's actions were authorized under federal law and were necessary and proper.

If Minnesota charged the agents, they could seek to move the case to federal court and argue they are immune from prosecution. To prevail, the state would have to show their actions were outside of their official duties or were objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful. If a judge ruled an officer was immune, the case would be dismissed and the state would not be able to charge him again.

COULD FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGE THE OFFICERS?

Federal prosecutors can charge law enforcement officers for fatal shootings, but the bar is very high and charges are rare. Prosecutors would need to show an officer knew his conduct was unlawful or acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional limits of his authority, which is difficult to prove in court. The Trump administration has so far defended the officers' actions.

WHAT DEFENSES WOULD THE ICE AGENTS HAVE?

In addition to federal immunity, the agents could argue that their actions were reasonable under the Constitution, that they acted in self-defense or that they did not act with intent to harm or kill the victims.

COULD THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES SUE FOR CIVIL DAMAGES?

Federal officers are immune from civil lawsuits unless their conduct clearly violated a clearly established constitutional right. This legal standard, known as qualified immunity, has become a highly effective tool for shielding police officers accused of using excessive force, a series of Reuters investigative stories found in 2020.

However, victims can also sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work. This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity that usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In an FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully. The statute would allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

But while the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.

The crisis response from President Trump’s top Homeland Security officials followed a familiar playbook from an administration eager to project grit and resolve, particularly on immigration, in the face of inconvenient facts. Despite their efforts, damage from the incident continued to reverberate Sunday, creating political jeopardy for the president.

Videos that emerged of Pretti’s killing enraged the public. Government lines justifying the use of lethal force prompted blowback among staunch Republican supporters and conservative groups. Negotiations in Congress to thwart another shutdown were upended over Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding. And a Trump-appointed judge blocked the administration from attempting to destroy evidence in the case, lending weight to fears of a cover-up.

It is new terrain for Trump, whose handling of immigration had been a rare bright spot in polling of his job performance throughout his first year back in office. Now, for the first time, surveys show a plurality of Americans disapprove of the administration’s enforcement tactics, with 1 in 3 Republicans expressing concern they have grown too harsh.

Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at a hospital for veterans in Minneapolis, was shot 10 times at close range by ICE agents. Multiple videos of the incident appear to show Pretti attempting to aid a fellow civilian who had been pushed by an ICE officer, before he himself was wrestled to the ground by agents.

He had been carrying a firearm that Minneapolis police said was lawfully purchased and registered. The videos that circulated on social media do not indicate that he had brandished, or was attempting to reach for, his weapon, despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accusing Pretti of attending the protest with the aim of committing violence.

Bill Essayli, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, warned that approaching law enforcement while armed created “a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.” But the administration’s decision to blame Pretti’s death on his decision to bear arms drew harsh rebuke from 2nd Amendment advocates across the Republican Party.

“Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the National Rifle Assn. said in a statement.

Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, accused Noem and Greg Bovino, Trump’s head of the U.S. Border Patrol, of making matters “far worse by being unrestrained in how they proceed.”

“The President is a great marketer and PR guy,” Erickson wrote on X. “While those around him may not realize it, I’m pretty sure he understands another dead American with his team rushing to undermine second amendment arguments and define the dead guy with a lot of facts still unknown is a bad look.”

John Mitnick, the general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term, said he was “enraged and embarrassed” by the agency’s “lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty,” and called for the president’s impeachment and removal.

“People have had enough,” Brian O’Hara, Minneapolis’ police chief, told CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year, last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn’t shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that’s been killed, it’s the third shooting within three weeks.”

This month, Renee Nicole Good, also 37 and a mother of three, was fatally shot by an ICE agent while in her car, shortly after dropping her son off at school. As in Pretti’s case, Noem and other senior administration officials justified the incident within hours of her death by impugning the victim’s motives without producing substantive evidence.

The aggressive response comes as the administration has faced accusations of misrepresenting other facts to the public.

After the president confused Greenland with the separate island nation of Iceland four times in a speech last week in Switzerland, Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, flatly denied he had made the mix-up.

And on the same trip, Trump dismissed the role of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in the war in Afghanistan — where partner nations lost more than 1,000 soldiers over the course of the conflict — falsely claiming they “stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.” The remark has infuriated some of Washington’s closest allies.

Only when Noem was questioned by a conservative reporter on Fox News about the circumstances of Pretti’s death did she suggest error may have been at fault.

“This happened in seconds,” Noem said, asked whether Pretti had been shot and killed after being disarmed of a weapon he hadn’t brandished in the first place. “They clearly feared for their lives and took action to defend themselves.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e9c3a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3469x1821+0+246/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fca%2F032e55a947deb8c41b50956ac284%2Fap26025583749400.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 17:59:46.440833

The latest shooting has also sparked a legal fight over control of the investigation and renewed calls by state and city officials for an end to the immigration surge that has swept across Minneapolis and surrounding cities.

Federal officials said agents were acting in self-defence by opening fire on Saturday morning, local time, when Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse, stepped into a confrontation between an immigration officer and a woman on the street.

Officials said Mr Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Mr Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.

Mr Pretti's family said they were ""heartbroken but also very angry"" at authorities, saying in a statement that Mr Pretti was a kind-hearted person who wanted to make a difference in the world.

Former US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama put out a statement saying Mr Pretti's death was a ""heartbreaking tragedy"".

""It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,"" they said.

""For weeks now, people across the country have been rightly outraged by the spectacle of masked ICE recruits and other federal agents acting with impunity and engaging in tactics that seem designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city.

""These unprecedented tactics — which even the former top lawyer of the Department of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration has characterised as embarrassing, lawless and cruel — have now resulted in the fatal shootings of two US citizens.

A federal judge has already issued an order blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to the shooting, after state and county officials sued.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the lawsuit filed on Saturday is meant to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect. A court hearing is scheduled for Monday in federal court in St Paul.

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which are named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from the Associated Press.

Another federal judge previously ruled that officers participating in the federal immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, though an appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling days before Saturday's shooting.

The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Governor Tim Walz, officials said, with troops sent to both the shooting site and a federal building where officers have squared off daily with demonstrators.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Mr Pretti showed up to ""impede a law enforcement operation"".

She questioned why he was armed but did not offer details about whether Mr Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.

But gun rights groups have noted it is legal to carry firearms during protests.

""Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers or exercising their First Amendment rights,"" the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement.

""These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.""

Trump blames Democrats

The president weighed in on social media by lashing out at Mr Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.

He shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: ""What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?""

Mr Trump said the Democratic governor and mayor ""are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric"".

US House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among several Democratic politicians demanding that federal immigration authorities leave Minnesota.

She also urged Democrats to refuse to vote to fund US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying via social media: ""We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer later said that Democrats would not vote for a spending package that included money for DHS, which oversees ICE.

Senator Schumer's statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down January 30 when funding runs out.

Mr Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an ICE officer killed 37-year-old Renee Good on January 7, sparking widespread protests.

Mr Pretti's family was furious at federal officials' description of the shooting.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,"" the family statement said.

""Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.

""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

Video shows officers, man who was shot

When the Saturday confrontation began, bystander video shows protesters blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on a commercial street in south Minneapolis.

The videos show Mr Pretti stepping in after an immigration officer shoves a woman.

Mr Pretti appears to be holding his phone toward the officer, but there's no sign he is holding a weapon.

The officer shoves Mr Pretti in his chest, and pepper sprays him and the woman.

Soon, at least seven officers are forcing Mr Pretti to the ground. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. An officer holding a canister strikes him near his head several times.

A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it is not clear where it came from. Multiple officers back off. More shots are heard. Officers back away, and the man lies motionless on the street.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander leading Mr Trump's crackdown, was repeatedly pressed on CNN's Sunday State of the Union for evidence that Mr Pretti did anything illegal or assaulted law enforcement, as officials have claimed.

Mr Bovino said it was ""very evident"" that Mr Pretti was not following the the officers' orders.

""It's too bad the consequences had to be paid because he injected himself into that crime scene,"" he said.

""He made the decision.""

Mr Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and the state would lead the investigation into the shooting.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

Protests continue

Demonstrations broke out in several cities across the country, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles.

In Minneapolis, protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather with temperatures around -21 degrees Celsius.

An angry crowd gathered after the shooting and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them ""cowards"" and telling them to go home.

Protesters dragged garbage bins from alleyways to block streets, and people chanted ""ICE out now"" and ""Observing ICE is not a crime"".

As darkness fell, hundreds of people mourned quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting.

A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.

Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration.

""It feels like every day something crazier happens,"" he said.

""What's happening in our community is wrong, it's sickening, it's disgusting.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4d3922968675aabc27111eefcb76d5db?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1687&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=157&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:57.523431

What makes the immigration agencies different? - USA Today,Christopher Cann,,,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/25/immigration-and-customs-enforcement-border-patrol/88347803007/,"The ongoing immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota involves mainly two branches of the Department of Homeland Security: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

ICE is tasked with enforcing the nation's immigration laws in the interior of the country, while Border Patrol officers do so near border crossings and ports of entry.

But under the second Trump administration, those distinctions have become murky as the two agencies have undergone sweeping changes – and increasingly work alongside one another – to boost President's Donald Trump's wide-reaching deportation campaign.

Border Patrol, which is typically constrained to a 100-mile zone near any U.S. border, began deploying into the interior of the country, leading some of the most intense and visible enforcement operations in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, for example. They've assisted helping ICE agents conducting immigration stops across the country, including in Minneapolis.

ICE, meanwhile, has seen a more than doubling of its workforce after receiving a historic funding boost through Trump's massive tax and spending legislation, which he dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" With $84 billion at its disposal, ICE has become the nation's most well-funded law enforcement agency, over the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The agency has become the face of the nation's immigration enforcement in many respects, with protesters organizing ""ICE Out"" demonstrations nationwide and polls showing Americans becoming less favorable of its tactics.

The ongoing federal immigration operation in Minneapolis, which has prompted intensifying protests after federal officers shot and killed two people in less than a month, involves 3,000 agents from Border Patrol and ICE. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, described it as the largest immigration operation ever.

Can Border Patrol and ICE conduct arrests and searches?

Border Patrol agents can make stops, arrests and search vehicles, particularly within 100 miles of border crossings and ports of entry, the agency says. In that 100-mile zone, Border Patrol agents have broad authority to interrogate people and conduct warrantless searches when there's ""reasonable suspicion"" of immigration violations.

ICE says its agents can ""briefly detain"" people who they have ""reasonable suspicion"" of being in the country illegally. The agency also says its agents can ""arrest people they believe are illegal aliens"" and ""initiate consensual encounters and speak with people"" on the street.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that cleared the way for ICE to use race, accents and places of work as factors in deciding who to stop and potentially detain. Since the ruling, state and local officials, protesters and even police chiefs have accused immigration enforcement agents of engaging in racial profiling.

ICE is also facing scrutiny over its assertion that federal officers can forcibly enter homes without a warrant signed by a judge – a move constitutional scholars, immigration experts and a federal judge say is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment.

How to tell ICE and Border Patrol agents apart

Many federal immigration agents involved in the latest high-profile operations have worn masks, balaclavas, hats and sunglasses, with no personal identifiers, unlike local police who often have visible badge numbers.

Many have also refused to identify themselves or the particular agency they're with, which has fueled confusion among civilians and local law enforcement alike.

Border Patrol agents often dress in dark green colors or camouflage, and they often identify their agency with vests reading ""U.S. Border Patrol"" or with patches on their sleeves. Some agents in U.S. cities are a part of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, a team specialized in high-risk operations like counterterrorism and hostage rescue. These agents have been seen wearing vests that say ""BORTAC.""

ICE agents, meanwhile, have been known to wear vests reading ""Police ICE"" or ""HSI,"" which is a reference to Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of ICE that handles federal criminal probes. ICE agents have also been seen dressed in plainclothes, sometimes with a visible badge reading ""ICE."" Many of the street operations are conducted with unmarked cars.

David Harvey quit on Friday but Richie Taylor, Mayes’ spokesperson, has not confirmed whether Harvey’s resignation was directly due to the attorney general’s rhetoric on a 12News interview from Tuesday, according to azcentral.com’s Stacey Barchenger.

Taylor did say that Mayes “was articulating a very deep concern she has about the possibility for these situations to spin out of control and end in tragedy,” as Minneapolis has recently experienced a pair of deadly shootings involving federal agents.

Mayes has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2022.

What did Attorney General Kris Mayes say about ICE, Stand Your Ground law?

The controversy began when Mayes expressed concerns that confrontations between Arizona residents and ICE could turn deadly in an interview with 12News. She called the combination of armed residents who are empowered under the law to defend themselves and mask-wearing agents without uniforms “a recipe for disaster.”

Brahm Resnik, the journalist conducting the interview, asked her to clarify if she was “giving license to a person to shoot an officer.”

“Absolutely not. But how do you know they’re a peace officer? That’s the key,” Mayes said. “And so if there’s a situation where somebody pulls out their gun, because they know Arizona is a Stand Your Ground state, then it becomes, did they reasonably know that they were a peace officer? You know? I mean, this is a different set of circumstances in the state of Arizona.”

Mayes also vowed in the interview to prosecute any ICE agent who violates Arizona law, although federal immunity law makes that more complicated to bring to fruition.

Mayes talked further about the issue Thursday during an interview with KTAR News 92.3 FM’s Outspoken. She explained that under Arizona law, residents who reasonably believe their lives are in danger can use lethal force to protect themselves.

“If you are really sure that they are ICE and they present a badge or they present identification, then I would not recommend using lethal force against them. But one of the worries that I have is … that we have a Stand Your Ground law in Arizona,” she said.

Joe Clure, executive director of the Arizona Police Association, responded to the attorney general’s comments Friday on KTAR News, calling them “reckless” and “dangerous.”

“I was in complete shock when I heard the … highest law enforcement official in the state of Arizona essentially giving a tutorial on how to shoot a police officer, specifically ICE agents, and get away with it,” Clure said.

Clure also accused Mayes of misinterpreting Arizona’s Stand Your Ground law because it doesn’t allow for lethal force against law enforcement officers performing official duties.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of two Americans being killed at the hands of Trump’s lawless and out of control Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Congresswoman Haley Stevens (D-MI) announced she will cosponsor H.R. 7163(link is external), a proposal to divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund to state and local law enforcement agencies.

“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control—this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” said Michigan Congresswoman Haley Stevens. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”

H.R. 7163 would help hire and train 200,000 local police officers nationwide, investing in proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.

The bill would move the additional funding granted to ICE in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to local law enforcement agencies, leaving the agency with historically normal funding levels to conduct traditional immigration enforcement operations.

It would reallocate $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions).

It would reallocate $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens has been leading the fight to hold ICE accountable in Congress and to rein in Donald Trump’s repeated abuses of power during his Administration.

Last week, Stevens voted against(link is external) the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, refusing to fund ICE’s operations without major reforms or accountability measures.

Last year, Stevens cosponsored the VISIBLE Act(link is external) to prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities.

Stevens joined over 150 of her colleagues in demanding(link is external) ICE end its surge of officers in Minnesota and conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent.

Following a lack of accountability or answers related to Gantchev’s death and the death of Renee Nicole Good, Stevens called for the immediate removal(link is external) of Secretary Kristi Noem and cosponsored an effort to impeach her in the House of Representatives.

Stevens voted against(link is external) the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gave ICE its nearly $75 billion windfall.

Stevens introduced the Stop Trump’s Abuse of Power Act(link is external), legislation to prevent the President from deploying the military against Americans without express consent from state officials, an authoritarian tactic this President has used repeatedly to fuel fear and intimidation during aggressive ICE crackdowns.

Stevens voted against(link is external) the Laken Riley Act, which would sweep thousands of people into jails and detention centers at enormous taxpayer expense while diverting key law enforcement resources and potentially violating civil liberties.

We’ve already passed six funding bills.
“There is no way Senate Democrats can approve funding for an agency that is killing innocent Americans in the streets.","A second high-profile killing by a federal agent in Minneapolis has jeopardized the chances of Congress averting a partial government shutdown as Democrats come out en masse against the funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Lawmakers had been on the verge of completing their funding work for fiscal 2026 this week after the House last week passed its final four appropriations bills. However, the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, 37, a nurse at the city’s Veterans Affairs hospital, by a Border Patrol agent has seemingly torpedoed the chances of those bills passing the Senate, with one key Democrat after another saying they will not vote to fund DHS.

The DHS bill is tied in with five others that fund the departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education — all of which have broad support.

Democrats are now saying they will not support the so-called minibus as long as the DHS portion is included. Senate Democrats are expected to have an all-members call on Sunday evening to figure out the plan forward, one aide told The Hill.

“I hate shutdowns. … But I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told “Face The Nation” on Sunday. “Take up DHS by itself. Let’s have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what’s going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don’t have to have a shutdown.”

The Maine independent’s comments came a day after multiple key Democrats indicated they will vote against any funding package that includes the DHS segment.

Among them were Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who said that he was against it Friday morning before the latest shooting. All four were among the eight Democrats who voted to end the 43-day government shutdown in November. King was also part of that group.

“The Trump Administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability. They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement,” Cortez Masto said in a statement, after previously pitching her colleagues on a fix that would not require a shutdown. “This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

“I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,” she said. “We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget. We’ve already passed six funding bills. Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe.”

Adding to the chorus was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who announced on Saturday that Democrats “will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill” with the DHS bill included.

The latest calls from the minority party mark a moment of whiplash.

Democrats were furious in recent weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, amid the protests in the Twin Cities. Almost all House Democrats voted against a stand-alone DHS bill last week, but lawmakers and Capitol Hill sources were still hopeful as recently as Friday that the “minibus” would stay on track.

One former senior Senate Democratic aide had told The Hill on Friday that the chances of a shutdown were roughly 25 percent as Democrats had been hearing from constituents about ICE actions in their home states and were under pressure to act.

Now, it’s tough to see how the measure moves on.

“90 percent [chance of a] shutdown,” the former aide said Sunday morning. “There is no way Senate Democrats can approve funding for an agency that is killing innocent Americans in the streets. It’s the only lever of power they have left to show the American people they are standing up to Trump and ICE.”

The killing of Pretti has also spawned another clash between federal and state agencies. Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of President Trump’s Border Patrol operations, blamed Pretti for the incident — an account that has come under major skepticism from statewide officials.

Up until recently, Democrats had also been skittish about careening into another shutdown, having felt the aftershocks from the longest shutdown in history last fall, which came over their insistence on extending the enhanced ObamaCare subsidies.

Both sides had hailed the bipartisan work to clear the funding decks for 2026. Schumer earlier in the month had insisted that lawmakers were not heading toward a shutdown during a Sunday show appearance, with appropriators being pleased at the progress.

However, they all acknowledged the DHS measure was a particularly difficult one for them to get their arms around from the get-go.

We can trust the American people with the truth.” The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis.","The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.

Mere hours after Mr. Pretti died, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, declared without offering evidence that Mr. Pretti had “committed an act of domestic terrorism.” Gregory Bovino, a border patrol official, offered his own assessment: “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

These unfounded and inflammatory judgments pre-empt the outcome of an investigation, which the Department of Homeland Security has promised. They also appear wholly inconsistent with several videos recorded at the scene.

Those videos showed that Mr. Pretti had nothing but a phone in his hands when he was tackled by border patrol agents, and that he never drew the gun he was carrying (and reportedly had a license to carry). Indeed, the videos seem to show that one federal agent took the gun from Mr. Pretti moments before a different agent shot him from behind. Separate analyses by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, CBS News and other organizations all concluded that the videos contradict the Trump administration’s description of the killing.

The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears. Ms. Noem and Mr. Bovino are lying in defiance of obvious truths. They are lying in the manner of authoritarian regimes that require people to accept lies as a demonstration of power.

Even worse is that all of this feels so terribly familiar. Earlier this month, a federal agent shot and killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. In that case, too, the Trump administration has demonized the victim and has blocked a state investigation of the killing.

Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.

The temperature in Minneapolis is dangerously high. There is an urgent need for the federal agents deployed to the city to step back and take a breath before more Americans are hurt or killed. Those protesting the Trump administration have an equal obligation to avoid violence.

The American people also need answers about whether federal agents acted inappropriately, and the behavior of the Trump administration means that it will be impossible to trust any federal investigation that it conducts. President Trump and his appointees have demonstrated themselves to be unconcerned with truth and willing to lie to serve their own interests. Congress therefore must step in. The Constitution vests it with the power to hold hearings, issue subpoenas and demand answers.

Congress ought to investigate both the circumstances of the recent killings in Minneapolis and the broader conduct of the federal agencies engaged in Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown, including their treatment of peaceful protesters. The video evidence shows that the incident that ended in Mr. Pretti’s death began when a federal agent lunged at a protester and knocked her to the ground. There are many similar videos and documented instances of federal agents using unnecessary violence against people who are peacefully protesting or documenting events — both behaviors protected under the First Amendment.

Congress has the power to hold the administration accountable through its control of federal spending. A pending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security offers a crucial opportunity to perform scrutiny and impose necessary guardrails, such as funding for body cameras.

The federal government also has sought to prevent investigations by the state of Minnesota. This must end. A federal judge in Minnesota issued a temporary restraining order on Saturday evening, at the behest of the state, barring federal agencies from destroying evidence related to Mr. Pretti’s killing. The need for such an order is both evident and extraordinary.

“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican increasingly at odds with Mr. Trump, posted on social media on Saturday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”

The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis. It is a disgrace that the first public comment by Mr. Trump in the wake of Mr. Pretti’s death was to post a picture on social media of what he described as “the gunman’s gun.” Stephen Miller, arguably Mr. Trump’s most influential adviser, wrote on social media, without offering evidence, that Mr. Pretti was “an assassin.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/opinion/25ICE-editorial-image/25ICE-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:57:54.374412

While the weakening resolve was far from a full break with Trump, it signals growing unease with the administration’s aggressive actions as Democrats threaten another government shutdown and November’s midterm elections come into view. Until now, Republicans have backed Trump as he deploys federal agents and National Guard to US cities.

Hundreds of videos have shown the agents using pepper spray, shoving, punching and kicking protesters who have stayed largely peaceful and are recording the agents’ actions. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a nurse at a VA hospital, while he was subdued and on his knees after they discovered a gun he had a permit to carry.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, suggested on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures that Trump should consider going “to another city and then maybe let the people of Minneapolis decide” how to proceed on immigration. He also defended immigration agents.

New York Republican Andrew Garbarino, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, has requested public testimony from top immigration officials, telling them in a letter Saturday that Congress “has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Other Republicans who have previously broken with Trump on other matters — including retiring Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Thomas Massie — were more frank.

“There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on X.

Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, also called in post on X for an investigation “both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system.”

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said on CNN’s State of the Union that the agents involved in Pretti’s killing were “most likely” being placed on administrative leave and sent from Minneapolis.

Another Senate Republican, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also broke sharply from the White House’s messaging and demanded “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis “incredibly disturbing” and said the credibility of ICE and Homeland Security are at stake.

“We can trust the American people with the truth,” Cassidy said.

But silence from other leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, suggest that many in the party are still weighing how to respond to Pretti’s killing.

Shutdown Threat

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer vowed late Saturday to block a massive spending package next week unless Republicans strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security, dramatically increasing the risk for a partial US government shutdown.

Democratic opposition to the funding package potentially affects not just Homeland Security but also the departments of Defense, Labor, Education, State, Treasury and Health and Human Services.

None of the Republicans speaking on Sunday mentioned the looming shutdown fight.

The effects of another shutdown would be widespread, including possibly delaying the next Bureau of Labor Statistics report.

In the event of a shutdown, many essential workers — including the military and Transportation Security Administration agents — may have to work without pay. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol employees would likely be paid through additional funding in Trump’s tax bill signed last year.

The House passed the spending bill Thursday and left Washington until after the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.

With the White House calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and accusing him of impeding the work of Border Patrol, despite video evidence to the contrary, Senate Republican leaders will be under enormous pressure to protect DHS funding.

The spending legislation needs votes from at least seven Democrats to pass the Senate.

Several moderates in the party quickly announced Saturday they’d oppose the bill. .

At least one other American, Renee Good, was killed by an ICE agent when he stopped her for partly blocking a street with her car, claiming she tried to run him over.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE.”

Forcing a shutdown risks hard-fought Democratic victories in the spending deal, including reversing many Trump cuts to medical research, foreign aid, education grants and mass transit.

The situation in Minnesota, however, has alienated key Democratic senators.

Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, each of whom voted to end the last shutdown, said in statements Saturday they would oppose funding for Homeland Security without changes. Rosen insisted she will oppose funding “until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said the resistance isn’t about his party or politics.

“It’s about our country and our Congress, and what we need to do to impose some safeguards on an out-of-control agency which is imbued with a culture of lawlessness and seems to be committing murder in Minneapolis,” Blumenthal said.

Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, called Pretti’s killing a “heartbreaking tragedy.”

“It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,” they said in a statement.

Delays Ahead

The Senate, a slow-moving legislative body, already faces potential delays from an expected snowstorm. The House’s planned absence next week complicates matters further ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

All but seven House Democrats voted against the DHS bill in the House, with many in the party seeking body camera requirements and other restraints on raids by ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Top Senate Democrat spending panel member Patty Murray said she won’t support the DHS bill as it stands, and it “needs to be split off from the larger funding package.”

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray said in a post on X. “I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE,” the crowd chanted.

One sign was held by Indigo Moore, 27, a school administrator who lives in Manhattan. She was horrified by online videos of Mr. Pretti’s shooting. Ms. Moore said she had been to Union Square on Friday for a similarly frigid protest against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“At this rate I’m getting pretty angry,” she said, “and that’s what’s keeping me warm.”

Attendees expressed a mix of anguished resignation and outraged optimism about what effect the demonstration might have.

For Ella Devi, 18, a Parsons University student who lives in Manhattan and who had campaigned for Mayor Zohran Mamdani in Union Square last year, the turnout was a sign that a political movement for change was gaining force.

“I hope it puts pressure on electeds to abolish ICE,” she said.

Angela Fowler, a psychiatric nurse practitioner who lives in Manhattan, said the protest served less as a portent of a good future than as a place to mourn.

“I’m not angry, I’m hurt,” Ms. Fowler said, adding that Mr. Pretti reminded her of her seven kids, four of whom are veterans. “This is America and I love America,” she said, referring to the scene around her.

Ms. Fowler’s sign read “Protesting ICE Is Not a Crime!” Other signs read, “Stop ICE Terror,” “ICE Is Trump’s Gestapo” and “No Kings.”

Manny Vasquez, 21, a service industry worker from Queens, held a giant sign featuring the face of Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House leader, and the words: “Abolish ICE Jeffries.”

“It has always been, I think, the fear, and now I think closer to the reality that the Trump administration is creating this mayhem, particularly in cities in swing states, in order to take control of the election, to say, ‘Oh, the city’s out of control, the state’s out of control, you can’t trust the state government, we just need to run the election in November,’” Murphy told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Murphy’s remarks come less than 24 hours after a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an American citizen, in Minneapolis. The administration has sent thousands of CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel to Minneapolis, amid a federal probe into fraud within Minnesota’s social services programs.

In a Saturday letter to Minnesota Gov.

The Hill has reached out to the DOJ and Walz’s office for comment.

In addition to Minneapolis, the administration has sent federal immigration enforcement to other Democratic-run cities and states, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and Maine, over the past year. That has sparked concerns from local and state officials and law enforcement.

BOSTON — A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction just before midnight last night to stop the Trump administration from revoking people’s legal status under the Family Reunification Parole (FRP) program while litigation in Svitlana Doe v. Noem proceeds. This comes after the judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 10 that temporarily blocked the administration from separating those families for 14 days.

More than 8,400 future green card holders faced losing lawful status and work authorization after the Trump administration announced in mid-December 2025 that it would prematurely revoke their parole. Green card holders and U.S. citizen sponsors were left scrambling to gain clarity for their immigrant family members who had already shown eligibility for future green cards. The court heard arguments from the government and from attorneys for plaintiffs earlier this month.

“Today’s ruling reaffirms that the Trump administration cannot ignore our nation’s laws in order to rip immigrant families apart,” said Esther Sung, legal director of Justice Action Center. “We are talking about people who have done everything the U.S. government has asked of them and who, in many cases, are mere weeks or months from finally receiving their green cards. These families should be able to live their lives and pursue their immigration cases peacefully and without fear that they will be ripped away from their loved ones.”

Among other findings, the court’s opinion noted that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the administration’s manner of terminating FRP parole was arbitrary and capricious and that the government had failed to provide FRP beneficiaries with sufficient notice that their grants of parole would be prematurely terminated. In describing the plight facing this particular group of people, the opinion noted, “FRP Parolees have arrived in the United States after a long process, following all directives from USCIS, to obtain lawful permanent residence in this country…many parolees, upon receiving approval to travel to the United States and seek parole, prepare for a permanent move.”

“The Trump administration cannot be allowed to strip people of their legal rights arbitrarily, and we are relieved that the judge recognized this in her ruling,” said Anwen Hughes, senior director of legal strategy and legal initiatives at Human Rights First. “Today’s preliminary injunction means that the Trump administration cannot de-legalize thousands of immigrants throughout the country who have done everything the U.S. government asked of them in order to be here. Most importantly, it means that families will get to remain together and build their futures without being unjustly ripped apart.”

On December 29, 2025, Justice Action Center and Human Rights First rushed into court on behalf of family members of U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents waiting to become eligible to apply for green cards whose parole status would have been revoked on January 14, 2026. These people, who entered the United States under FRP, are represented by five new plaintiffs added to Svitlana Doe v. Noem, the class action lawsuit filed on behalf of humanitarian parole beneficiaries, sponsors, and Haitian Bridge Alliance. The plaintiffs had asked the court to block the Trump administration’s Federal Register Notice revoking FRP beneficiaries’ lawful status and to allow the plaintiffs to incorporate this effort into their existing lawsuit to protect parole.

I asked the man how he knew the drivers at the intersection were ICE agents.
Were they ICE agents?
Were they people watching for ICE agents?
As tensions in Minneapolis escalated, Lang announced he would be coming to town to lead a “CRUSADER MARCH on ‘Little Somalia,’” with the aim of burning a Quran outside Minneapolis City Hall on Jan. 17.","Donald Trump’s most profound break with American democracy, evident in his words and actions alike, is his view that the state’s relationship with its citizens is defined not by ideals or rules but rather by expressions of power, at the personal direction of the president. That has been clear enough for years, but I had not truly seen what it looked like in person until I arrived in Minneapolis, my hometown, to witness what Trump’s Department of Homeland Security called Operation Metro Surge.

On Jan. 14, at 7:44 p.m., eight hours after I got to town, the City of Minneapolis’s official X account announced that there were “reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in North Minneapolis.” “Federal law enforcement,” as everyone by then knew, meant one of the 3,000 immigration agents fanned out across the metropolitan area, which Minneapolitans invariably called “ICE”: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency at the vanguard of the surge.

They had been there since December, ostensibly in relation to a fraud investigation that fell well out of their departmental purview and settled instead for what appeared outwardly as a more indiscriminate pursuit of potential immigration violations. The Minneapolis metro area is not big: Hennepin and Ramsey Counties — home to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively, and many of their suburbs — are together less than one-fifth the size of Los Angeles County, the target of the administration’s first such immigration crackdown last year.

In the heightened atmosphere of the moment, the lines between documentation and confrontation had grown blurry. ICE officers, when they stuck around anywhere for more than a few minutes, were likely to be met by not just one or two camera-wielding observers but many, and observation inevitably turned into protest. The latent combustibility of these encounters was visible in the footage that bystanders had captured of an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, fatally shooting a resident, Renee Good, in her car on a snowy street in South Minneapolis on Jan. 7. That combustibility would be visible again in the fatal shooting on Jan. 24 of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old V.A. hospital registered nurse, by Border Patrol agents.

Shock over the violence of the deployment quickly gave way to redoubled anger. Within minutes of the city’s X post on Jan. 14, a crowd of perhaps a hundred people from all over the metro area had assembled at the location, in the Hawthorne neighborhood on Minneapolis’s north side, where, according to an F.B.I. agent’s affidavit, an ICE agent had shot an undocumented immigrant in the leg after being attacked with a broom during an arrest. When I arrived, several blocks were cordoned off with crime-scene tape, and milling around in the darkness beyond it were federal agents in balaclavas and tactical gear, most of them identified by their patches as members of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations unit.

A woman in a fur-ruffed parka swung a plastic post at the rear windshield of the vehicle, which shattered with a dull crunch. It was not long before the air was alive with smoke grenades and sting balls and thick with tear gas. Faces peered out of second-floor windows along what had been, less than an hour earlier, a quiet residential street. “You killed Renee Good!” a man bellowed.

The atmosphere was strange and unstable for a street protest, missing some important steps of the usual choreography, and it took me a moment to realize why: I saw no police officers. I had passed a Minneapolis Police Department cruiser parked some distance down the street, but here, where the agents were clashing with the crowd, they were nowhere to be seen. The federal agents themselves looked more like a platoon of soldiers navigating a hostile foreign capital than conventional law enforcement in an American city.

For weeks, these agents had been actors in a kind of theater of power, meting out various forms of state force and violence, framed by the smartphone cameras they carried, providing a steady stream of content for the Trump administration’s various social media platforms. What was clear in person, seeing the scene outside of the frame, were the limits of this performance of power. The agents had no capacity to maintain order or much apparent interest in doing so. Their presence was a vector of chaos, and controlling it was not in their job description. All that was holding the crowd back, as far as I could tell, was the knowledge that an officer like these shot a woman a week earlier and that another shot a man up the street an hour ago. I left the scene that night certain it would happen again.

‘Take Out That Phone and Hit Record’

Tim Walz, Minnesota’s embattled governor, appeared live on camera from his official residence on the night of the second shooting and clash. He described the federal deployment to his state as an “occupation” and “a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

This sort of citizen surveillance of federal agents is a tactic that had spread widely — often with the support of Democratic officials like Walz — along with the immigration raids themselves, refined over the course of previous operations in Los Angeles and especially Chicago. As Walz suggested, it served a kind of double purpose: capturing evidence and also capturing the narrative, showing the world what Trump’s immigration crackdown looked like in practice.

Because of Minneapolis’s small size, the sledgehammer scale of the deployment and the extreme contempt that Minneapolitans had for it, ICE-watching had attained a manic intensity in some neighborhoods of the city, which became an exacerbating factor in the fog-of-war confusion and paranoia the raids brought to town.

One afternoon, I was idling in my rental car in the parking lot of a gas station where my friends used to buy cigarettes in high school when I heard a shrill chorus of whistles behind me — Minneapolitans, like Chicagoans last year, had distributed them widely and blew them en masse to alert people to ICE’s whereabouts. I got out to look around, only to see that the whistlers were pointing at me. It was the third time I had been mistaken for an ICE agent in the space of a week.

On the ICE-watchers’ heels was a pack of journalists, many of whom I knew from the expanding media circuit of the great American unraveling: militia rallies, Trump court appearances, protests against immigration raids in other cities. I reached out to shake the hand of a celebrated war photographer, but he retracted it, holding up his palms apologetically: “Mace,” he said.

They had just come from a clash in a nearby park between locals and Gregory Bovino, the camera-mugging senior Border Patrol official, who had been on the scene in Minneapolis personally for weeks, ducking in and out of the action, often dressed in a military-style greatcoat that invited, and received, Gestapo comparisons. Someone pulled out a phone to show me a video of Bovino minutes earlier, personally lobbing a green-smoke grenade at some protesters, with the jocular informality of a backyard barbecue host tossing a tallboy to a newly arrived neighbor. As they left, once again a federal agent dropped a magazine of live ammunition in the street. Officers from Bovino’s agency would shoot and kill Pretti less than a mile away three days later.

What was striking, and not a little chilling, when you watched videos like this as well as their public digestion on various social media platforms, was that they did not differ dramatically from the videos that the Trump administration disseminated itself. Nor did people on either side of the country’s chasmic ideological divide seem to disagree all that much about what they were seeing in the images of immigrants being marched away from their cars in subzero temperatures and demonstrators pepper-sprayed at point-blank range. These were pictures of the state deploying violence confidently and with open disinterest for the niceties of process or protocol — the expression of power as an end to itself. To some, it was horrifying; to others, it was exhilarating. To many city residents I talked to, the message of it all was clear enough: Nobody could help them. They were on their own.

“I’ve been telling people, if you want to really be prepared for stuff like this that’s going on in Minneapolis right now, you need to know your neighbors,” Steve Gagner, a resident, told me the day after Walz’s address. We were sitting at a coffee shop not far from Gagner’s house in South Minneapolis, an area that had become the heart of the local resistance to the federal deployment. The shop’s owner was running around directing pickups and drop-offs of boxed groceries and household necessities stacked by the door: donations for the thousands of immigrant families, undocumented and otherwise, that were known to be hiding out in their homes across the metro area for fear of arrest.

South Minneapolis might be thought of, in coastal terms, as roughly comparable to Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights or Los Angeles’s Echo Park: a historically diverse (by Minneapolis standards) and working-class area that was now the gravitational center of the city’s college-educated, progressive professional cohort, a neighborhood of social workers and graphic designers. Gagner, a longhaired 41-year-old who grew up in the suburbs, now lives in the city with two children and twice as many jobs: carpentry and handyman work, animation and jewelry design. He had made the earrings he was wearing, in the image of the Minnesota state flag, which had taken on an unexpected valence in recent weeks as a banner of defiance.

South Minneapolis was also where George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in 2020. At the time, Gagner lived five blocks from the Third Precinct police station, where the officer, Derek Chauvin, was assigned; the first group of demonstrators had marched past Gagner’s house on the way to the station. “We were actually out there, clapping,” he said. Half an hour later, tear gas began wafting into the open windows. “And then,” he said, “everything erupted.”

The protests and rioting that followed Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, in which the Third Precinct building and a number of local businesses were burned down, were often depicted in the national media as occurring along racial lines, which was not quite right. They raged most furiously in largely white South Minneapolis, not the historically Black north-side neighborhoods like Hawthorne. Gagner had supported the protests and was highly critical of the Police Department, but he also did not particularly want his house to burn down.

He and others in nearby neighborhoods had formed ad hoc community-watch groups during the first days of the upheaval, and much of this informal infrastructure had been revived amid the current crisis. “I’ve seen a lot of the same people that stepped up before stepping right back into those roles,” Gagner said, though now people were using encrypted communications or staying offline entirely. “It’s also very different because this is” — his voice dropped to an incredulous whisper — “this is the government.”

Although the work they were doing was, in the current climate, clearly political, it felt strange to describe Gagner or anyone else I met who was involved in the rudimentary activities of the resistance as activists; most of their activities would, in any other circumstances, have seemed like the most uncontroversial kind of civic participation. Since the early days of the standoff, many people across the Twin Cities and their suburbs had joined neighborhood-level efforts, organized through Signal chats, to track the federal agents and had stood watch around locations — schools, apartment buildings, local businesses — they believed were particularly vulnerable.

But by mid-January, many of the people I talked to in South Minneapolis had decided it was more useful to focus on the targets of the raids, giving immigrant families’ children rides to school — federal agents in Minnesota and other states had been arresting parents during drop-offs and pickups — and delivering supplies to those who were afraid to leave their homes.

Other response efforts were coordinated through parent-teacher organizations, particularly those of schools with large populations of Latino students. The school-based organizing, like the ICE-watching tactics, was a strategy imported from community networks in Chicago, where parents last year mobilized around so-called sanctuary schools. Particularly for parents of elementary-school-age children, who found themselves suddenly having to explain why parents were standing guard against federal agents around the school property and why their Latino classmates were staying home, their latent politics had been supercharged by a very parental mix of fear and fury.

A mother at another school in South Minneapolis, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid drawing further attention to the school, described coming upon ICE agents detaining the driver of a car, then taking him away along with the keys. Looking in the abandoned vehicle, she saw a woman in the front seat and a small child huddled in the back seat. “They just — take off,” she said, and she started sobbing. “They just walk away. They don’t care. It’s like — we’re all people.”

I asked her how she discussed what was happening with her own children. “We’re lying to them all the time,” she said. “‘You are not in danger.’ I don’t think they are, but we can’t guarantee that. Because they” — ICE — “are not following the rules. We’re white, but who knows? You look at them wrong, and they’re going to smash your window.”

‘Don’t Turn On the Lights’

One afternoon later that week, I drove out to a nondescript lower-income apartment complex in a Minneapolis suburb. A man in his 30s let me into the building and led the way up to an apartment on the third floor, then closed the door behind us.

The apartment was small, and it felt smaller with the windows covered. The man and his wife, both of whom asked not to be identified out of fear of arrest, had tacked up a blanket over one window and a floral-print sheet over the other, illuminated by the wan winter light outside. Their young daughters would try to peek out, but the parents would shoo them away from the windows. If anyone pulled back the sheet, they warned the girls, drones could see inside.

The man left the apartment only for the most furtive missions: to take out the trash, to move the car when snowplows came to clear the parking lot. It took him a moment to recall when he had last ventured farther than that. It was November, he thought. That was around the time that “the school,” he said, “let us know that the raids were happening.”

The building was home to a number of immigrants like the man, who said he came with his wife and their daughters several years ago from Ecuador. He said they had petitioned for asylum at the border. This was a legal process under which an increasing number of people had been admitted during the Biden administration. Some asylum applicants cited highly specific threats to their lives. Others made much broader claims, like this man, who said he and his family had come to the United States because of prejudice against the country’s Indigenous people and the escalating violence in the capital, Quito, where they lived. Peaceful as recently as six years ago, it had since become a battleground in a proxy war between Mexican drug cartels vying for control of Pacific-coast smuggling routes.

The family’s claim was still in process, the man said. In the meantime, he said he had been given a work permit and a Social Security number. In the summer, he cut lawns; in the winter, he cleared snow. But an administrator at his daughters’ school had warned him that he should be careful about working outside. He began watching the street from inside the apartment.

He noticed large S.U.V.s, Chevy Suburbans with tinted windows, idling outside the apartment complex for a few hours at a stretch. He took a picture of one of them and sent it to someone at the school. “They told us: ‘They’re ICE. Be careful,’” he said. “‘Cover the windows. Don’t turn on the lights. Don’t go out shopping. If you need anything, ask.’” That was nearly two months ago.

It had taken a week or two, after the man stopped going to work and everyone stopped leaving the apartment, for the food to run out. After days of eating only potatoes, the family appealed for help to their church. Soon volunteers began dropping off essentials in cardboard boxes.

At first the family kept the girls home from school. But after the school warned that such absences could result in legal action, the girls resumed going every other day, escorted by a teacher or an administrator.

The girls asked why they couldn’t otherwise leave the apartment, why they couldn’t buy food themselves, why they couldn’t look out the windows, and the man tried to figure out what to tell them. “I have told them that there are people out there looking for criminals,” he said. Like most of the immigrants I met in Minnesota and elsewhere who had been affected by the immigration raids or were living in fear of them, he had supported the idea of rounding up violent criminals in the United States illegally when Trump first spoke of it. And he assured his daughters that he was not a criminal himself. “But we’re not from this country,” he would tell them, he said, “and we have to be careful. Because they’re taking everybody.”

Although his wife couldn’t bring herself to mention it to the girls, lately the man had started trying to talk to them about what would happen if their parents were arrested. This was difficult in part because he himself did not know what would happen. When it became clear that the federal agents sweeping the city had no plan for the children the raids left behind, school staff members started quietly urging immigrant parents to sign a delegation of parental authority form, which would give someone else the power to make decisions over their children — a limited form of custody. But who could the man even ask to take on such a responsibility? His family’s relatives in Minnesota were all in the same position as he was.

I asked the man how he knew the drivers at the intersection were ICE agents. “They were in two of those big trucks — the really big new ones that are driving around,” he said. Were they wearing masks? He didn’t know.

At some point, the paranoia in Minneapolis had created its own reality. The furtiveness and randomness of the documented raids was very real, but now half of Minneapolis and an ever-expanding press corps were driving around looking for federal agents, too, prowling streets and parking lots in ways that resembled the agents themselves, creating their own layers of rumor and confusion.

When I had first pulled into the apartment building’s parking lot, I saw an S.U.V. idling by the entrance, an iPhone visible against the windshield, filming me. When I got out and held up my press credential, the window rolled down to reveal two smiling white women who were out delivering food to people like the family in the apartment. “Sorry!” one of them said brightly.

Leaving the building an hour later, I saw two more large S.U.V.s slowly circling the lot. Were they ICE agents? Were they people watching for ICE agents? Who knew? Earlier that day, outside a church that was distributing aid, I overheard a young man on his phone reporting a “confirmed ICE” vehicle. I looked around for it, until I realized he was reading off the license plate from my rental car.

‘The Somalis Have Taken Over Your Neighborhoods!’

When Trump, hours after returning to the presidency last year, pardoned the participants in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, one beneficiary was Edward Jacob Lang, a 30-year-old from upstate New York who had spent several years in jail awaiting trial on 11 charges for, among other things, attacking a Capitol Police officer with a metal baseball bat. Lang, who goes by Jake, had parlayed his incarceration into a brand as a sort of political prisoner-influencer, though he did not seem to actually have much of a profile on the right; two years ago, I stopped by a protest on his behalf outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was being held, and found it attended by fewer than 10 supporters. The people who most fervently followed him and his stunts — claiming to form a militia from inside jail, throwing Nazi salutes outside the AIPAC headquarters — seemed to be gullible and easily outraged liberals, along with the more shamelessly click-baiting reporters whose content they consumed.

As tensions in Minneapolis escalated, Lang announced he would be coming to town to lead a “CRUSADER MARCH on ‘Little Somalia,’” with the aim of burning a Quran outside Minneapolis City Hall on Jan. 17. The main, if unintended, effect of Lang’s announcement, besides stirring up the people who could be counted on to react to it, was to call attention to just how far Trump’s crackdown had drifted from its stated intentions. Trump initially said federal agents were coming to town in relation to the federal investigation of a several-billion-dollar fraud scandal involving the state’s social services, which had produced indictments of nearly 80 people, most of them members of the state’s Somali community — the largest Somali diaspora population in the country, much of it refugees who settled in Minnesota in the 1990s.

Trump, who had vowed to stop refugee flows to Minnesota during his 2016 campaign, had ranted against Somalis in December, calling them “garbage” in a cabinet meeting. But a majority of Minnesotan Somalis have U.S. citizenship, and by the time Lang came to town, the agents’ attention seemed to have largely shifted; the few arrests that D.H.S. publicly announced appeared to be mostly Latinos and Hmong immigrants.

“The Somalis have taken over your neighborhoods!” Lang shouted into a microphone as he marched through downtown. He was clad in a tactical vest that made him resemble the city’s new diaspora population of ICE agents; as right-wing influencers and law enforcement have embraced similar paramilitary gear and content-creation strategies, the lines that might have once distinguished them visually have grown sketchier. “These people are animals. Look at them! Look at them! Immigrant scum!”

When he got to City Hall, a crowd of perhaps several hundred counterprotesters was waiting for him. They leaned toward the most reliably bait-taking segments of the left-liberal spectrum, from the itinerant leftists leading chants for unrelated causes — “Free Palestine!” — with their own megaphones to older suburbanites holding up signs that read “LOVE ALWAYS WINS.” The South Minneapolis types I had been talking to throughout the week had been urging nonattendance.

I had wondered what a clash between whichever constituency Lang managed to mobilize — it was about 10 people — and an increasingly infuriated population would look like in a city where local law enforcement had been barely visible for days. Making my way through the crowd, I found Lang holed up in the well of a ground-floor window of City Hall along with a few others, gamely enduring the attacks of the crowd: an endless barrage of insults, a squirt gun that lashed him with gouts of freezing cold water and water balloons.

This was a move pioneered during Trump’s first term by more-enterprising right-wing influencers who, with video rolling, would place themselves in the path of particularly knuckle-headed anarchists in cities like Portland, Ore., and lean into their beatings with the verve of Italian soccer players. But there was, once again, something off about the way it was playing out in Minneapolis. I climbed onto a bench to get a better look, just in time to see Lang, who had jumped down from the window well, disappear into a sea of windmilling fists for several minutes, then emerge out the other side.

As the scrum surged in my direction, I joined the crush of people running after Lang, turning the corner past City Hall and bounding over a light-rail track. A man to my left turned and decked another man in the face. Both were wearing balaclavas and heavy coats; everyone was bundled up in so many layers of outerwear — the temperature was in the single digits — that the usual signifiers of political identities were impossible to make out. All anyone seemed to really know was that everyone was either chasing Lang or chasing the people chasing him, and that nobody seemed to be stopping anything; we had passed a single police cruiser idling alongside City Hall.

Lang made it several blocks, as far as the doorstep of the Hotel Indigo, before his pursuers caught up with him, knocked him down and began vigorously kicking him in the head. He managed to get to his feet and sprinted through the hotel bar with a few photographers in tow, crashing out a side entrance and into the back seat of a passing car, which a mob briefly waylaid in traffic before the vehicle managed to get free. (One of his rescuers, a transgender woman named Daye Gottsche, later told a local reporter that she had made it clear to Lang, as they drove him to safety, that she did “not support the type of man he is.”)

From the back of the crowd, it had been hard to follow exactly what was happening, and a number of demonstrators, believing Lang to be inside the hotel, lingered outside. Jody Carr, a retiree from the exurb Chaska, looked on from across the street with her daughter, a nurse. “I am disappointed in the people who’ve gotten violent, because that is not what this is about,” Carr told me. She had attended recent No Kings protests in Chaska; this was her first demonstration related to the ICE deployment. “I’m proud to be an American, but I’m not proud of what our administration is doing,” she said. One of her daughter’s co-workers, an American-born woman of Kenyan descent, had been stopped a few weeks before by ICE and thrown out of her car, she said — “in her scrubs on the way to work!”

Chaska sits on the far periphery of the Minneapolis metropolitan area, a politically mixed territory between the solidly Democratic metro area and Republican rural areas beyond. I asked Carr if there was disagreement about the deployment among the people she knew there, and she nodded.

“My niece told me I was a threat to humanity,” she said.

Just then, a van pulled up carrying a dozen Minneapolis Police Department officers in riot gear, arriving belatedly to disperse the crowd. Following a couple of bullhorn announcements about the impending use of chemical agents — after ICE, which fired them off with no warning, this seemed quaint — the demonstrators took an impromptu victory lap through the streets of downtown. A man with a drum led a call and response:

“Who protects us?”

“We protect us!""

I left the protest feeling numb: It seemed as if we had all come fairly close to seeing a man beaten to death in the street. I called Lang the next night to ask how he was doing.

Lang was back on the East Coast already. He told me he was up for an interview, but only if we did it in the form of a video clip that I would guarantee The Times would publish, and that he would as well. “That’s usually the way that I’m leaning toward things now, because the video content is so important for dissemination on both our social media platforms,” he said. We would not copublish a video. I went to sleep feeling a little sheepish. Lang was going to be fine.

The content, as he surely knew, was exceptional.

‘Get Out of the City’

I went to meet Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis at Karmel Mall, a large and labyrinthine complex of Somali businesses on Lake Street in South Minneapolis, on the afternoon of Jan. 22. The location was his staff’s choice, and a pointed one. As we walked through the mall, it was largely empty, with most of the market stalls closed and locked down behind metal shutters, another picture of a city battened down in a storm. The Islamic afternoon call to prayer drifted from a speaker over a deserted hallway. In one of the few open stalls, he spotted a merchant he knew. “Osman!” he called out. The man greeted him with a hug. “You are winning,” he said.

Although Walz’s career had run aground amid the fraud scandal — he announced, amid Operation Metro Surge, that he would not be running for governor again — Frey, like Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, had arguably benefited from the enemy-of-my-enemy politics the federal invasion foisted upon Minneapolis. Although he easily won re-election in November, many south-side progressives still grumbled about his support for the city’s Police Department during the George Floyd crisis, which had led to his heckling out of George Floyd Square during a visit to the memorial that June.

“I got spat on and shamed and booed,” he told me, tucking into a plate of goat and rice in the otherwise deserted food court. “But it was the right decision” not to defund the Police Department, he said. “And it’s the right decision now to tell ICE to get out of the city.”

Like other mayors and governors who had found themselves on the receiving end of Trump’s immigration raids, Frey — who, like Walz, is currently under investigation by Trump’s Justice Department for impeding the federal action — had responded with lawsuits and media appearances, projecting unequivocal defiance while carefully keeping city law-enforcement agencies out of the fray. When I brought up the Lang episode, he told me that the police, uniformed and not, were nearby, ready to intervene if necessary. “It had the potential to be a complete disaster, and it wasn’t,” he said.

This was true, but in the moment, that outcome had seemed to be luck as much as anything else; I hadn’t seen any officers around until well after the beating, I said. “They were there,” Frey insisted, “and they did run to help” Lang before he got away in the car. Lang, he pointed out, had not actually filed a police report about the assault.

Trump’s federal deployment in Minneapolis, like the others before it, was not only about immigration; it was also a kind of ritual disciplining of unruly liberals, a ripping away of the protections they had so long enjoyed and a demonstration of how little the politicians they elected could really do to stop it. This would be underscored two days later, hours after I left Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents confronting neighborhood observers several blocks from Karmel Mall shot Pretti, repeatedly and apparently after first disarming him of a gun he was licensed to carry and was not holding, based on video footage.

Only a couple of food vendors adjoining the food court were open, and when we arrived, Frey had stopped to commiserate with one of them, a young Somali man. “It’ll be like a light switch when ICE leaves,” he said. “It’ll be a celebration.”

“We’re going to have a big party,” the man said, hopefully.

Frey nodded. “People will be dancing in the hallways here.”

His promise echoed down the empty hall.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin shared a photo on social media Saturday of a federal law enforcement officer's severed finger after an anti-ICE agitator in Minneapolis allegedly bit it off.

""In Minneapolis, these rioters attacked our law enforcement officer and one of them bit off our HSI officer’s finger,"" McLaughlin wrote in the post. ""He will lose his finger.""

She shared photos of two people seemingly in custody, though it is unclear which person is the alleged biter.

Additional details about the assault have not yet been released, though ongoing protests have escalated after the deaths of two U.S. citizens during immigration enforcement operations in the blue city.

ICE SAYS 2 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING OFFICERS

Hours before McLaughlin's post, a Border Patrol agent was captured on video fatally shooting an armed man in Minneapolis amid a crowd of agitators.

The 37-year-old man, a U.S. citizen from Minneapolis, allegedly approached agents and then ""violently resisted,"" while armed with a 9 mm pistol and two magazines, according to Homeland Security officials.

Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said during a news conference Saturday it ""look[ed] like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.""

He reiterated that those who obstruct law enforcement are in violation of the law and will be arrested.

The Minnesota National Guard confirmed Saturday that, in addition to troops previously being mobilized at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office requested additional support, and more soldiers will be brought in.

“Our kuleana (responsibility) really is to be there as a calm, informed presence so that folks are aware that they have rights,” Goodman said.

On Maui, Mendoza-Jachowski said people have been taken more “quietly” than in other places.
“The Episcopal Church remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the dignity and safety of all people, particularly those most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions,” Spence said.","It was the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah when Zoe Goodman got the heads up that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were searching for someone in a temporary housing complex for Lahaina fire survivors.

Goodman, the lead volunteer trainer for El Pueblo en Acción Maui (The People in Action Maui), hustled over to the neighborhood. As the agents roamed the complex in a rented pickup, Goodman and other volunteers helped the person run through preparations, making sure they had an emergency contact and had signed a document that would allow a lawyer to contact them if they were taken into custody by ICE.

“Our kuleana (responsibility) really is to be there as a calm, informed presence so that folks are aware that they have rights,” Goodman said.

The agents eventually left the area without making an arrest, but the September episode was one of multiple confirmed and suspected sightings of ICE that have put the Maui community on edge, especially as arrests in Hawai‘i have climbed over the past year and an ICE agent’s fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Good sparked protests across the islands. On Saturday, a Minneapolis man was shot and killed by ICE, setting off a fresh wave of outrage.

On Maui, community groups and concerned citizens focused on immigrant rights and legal services created a coalition known as El Pueblo en Acción Maui to run an ICE tipline and watch group around late 2023 and early 2024, according to Veronica Mendoza-Jachowski, executive director of the nonprofit Roots Reborn that was formed after the fires and is part of the coalition. For awhile, it was the only group of its kind in the state, she said.

The network that Goodman estimated at 50 volunteers can be called at a moment’s notice to verify ICE sightings, help people review their rights and serve as legal observers when someone is being detained in hopes that they won’t get lost in “a black hole of the immigration and detention system.”

They’ve been extra busy over the past year. When Trump took office in January 2025, the tipline was flooded with dozens of text messages, emails and calls from people thinking they’d seen ICE.

“That fear was just heightened and they were on alert,” Mendoza-Jachowski said.

Last week, El Pueblo en Acción Maui announced on social media that ICE agents had showed up to a Kīhei church during sacrament hour on Jan. 11. While no arrests were made, it was another sobering reminder for the community that places once considered off-limits are now fair game to the federal agency.

“The worry here is as we continue to see ICE enforcement presence at these previously protected locations, that there will be a chilling effect,” said Tina Sablan, community and policy advocate with O‘ahu-based nonprofit The Legal Clinic. “Not only that people will stop going to church … but also kids will be afraid to go to school. Families will be afraid to access health care that they need. And there are ramifications for the entire community that will affect a wider sense of public safety when these places are no longer considered protected.”

In the first six months of 2025, ICE arrested 149 people in Hawai‘i, more than triple the amount of people arrested during the same period in 2024, the University of Hawai‘i’s Refugee and Immigration Law Clinic told a Senate Judiciary Committee in December, citing the Deportation Data Project.

ICE claims it’s detaining the “worst of the worst,” highlighting a handful of arrests tied to serious crimes like drugs, assault and firearms possessions. But Sablan pointed out that according to detentionreports.com, which keeps data on ICE detention facilities nationwide, out of a total average daily population of 74 at the Honolulu facility, 57 individuals (77%) were non-criminals.

On Maui, Mendoza-Jachowski said people have been taken more “quietly” than in other places. Aside from the high-profile case of several Maui County teachers who were wrongfully detained in Kahului as immigration officers were searching for someone else, arrests have included individual encounters like a Lahaina fire survivor who lost his home and business, and an undocumented Maui man who showed up at the Wailuku courthouse for a hearing on driving under the influence and without a license.

By contrast, ICE has made mass arrests during raids of Hawai‘i island coffee farms and Kaua‘i homes and businesses.

Sablan said she’s not sure why other islands have seen more mass enforcement, but noted that Maui has “a really strong network of folks” who have been working to educate people on their rights and keep tabs on ICE.

“I think that’s been really effective and had a very protective effect, particularly on communities in Maui,” Sablan said.

Mendoza-Jachowski said the experience of working in disaster response has helped the Maui organizations become more nimble in the face of growing enforcement and constant uncertainty.

El Pueblo en Acción Maui has been holding “Know Your Rights” training for restaurant workers, health care providers, faith leaders, educators and others, reminding them of such constitutional rights as being able to remain silent and refuse a search of themselves or their belongings without a judicial warrant.

Mendoza-Jachowski said “we don’t want anyone breaking the law,” so the goal is to inform people on their rights and equip them to make their own decisions in the moment.

Keeping the community informed and curbing false information is also the focus of the tipline, which takes calls and texts at (808) 500-5533. Volunteers work to confirm or debunk sightings by going to the location themselves or examining photos submitted to the tipline.

Mendoza-Jachowski remembers one report that turned out to be a DUI checkpoint near Mā‘alaea, and another that was a traffic control measure for a construction site. Once they used reverse image search to determine a photo sent to the tipline of law enforcement at a grocery store had actually been circulating on social media over a year ago and showed officers with the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources, whose green uniforms and holstered guns were reminiscent of ICE agents.

When it comes to deciding what to report, “we take that very seriously,” Mendoza-Jachowski said.

“We don’t want to start a frenzy,” she said. “So I think keeping our community calm means keeping our community safe, and so there is no very clear recipe for how we respond because every single one is so different.”

She said the groups decided to share information about the reports of ICE agents in a Kīhei church earlier this month because it came directly from a “trusted source” who witnessed firsthand the agents showing up and identifying themselves as immigration enforcement. They told church leaders that they were looking for three people and waited out the full service until they determined the people in question weren’t there.

For safety reasons, Mendoza-Jachowski did not share the name of the church.

Members of other churches in Kīhei said they’d also heard about the incident. Shannon Kama, church administrator at Kīhei Lutheran, said she’d gotten word about it from social media and the community service organizations that work with the church.

Kama said her church hasn’t discussed what they would do if ICE showed up, but she said if she saw them coming, “I would lock my office down and I would notify our Montessori preschool on property, just to try to keep everybody safe.”

“It’s just awful,” Kama said of the thought that ICE might come to a church. “Nobody wants to be fearful. We just need to all be mindful, and I think that’s our mindset of our congregation. … Personally, I just pray that nothing like that would happen and be protective of everybody else.”

Chuck Spence, treasurer of Trinity Episcopal-by-the-Sea in Kīhei, said he found out through text messages sharing the post from El Pueblo en Acción Maui. He said Trinity hasn’t had any encounters with ICE as far as he knows, and that the church holds prayers every week for people impacted by what is happening across the country.

“It’s too aggressive and too dangerous when people are starting to get killed,” Spence said.

He noted that Trinity “is an inclusive and all welcoming mission church” and pointed out that Episcopal Church leaders have condemned ICE-related violence, called for prayer and supported peaceful resistance.

“The Episcopal Church remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the dignity and safety of all people, particularly those most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions,” Spence said.

Churches have long been seen as safe havens off-limits to immigration enforcement, but in January 2025, after taking office, the Trump administration rolled back those protections for churches and other “sensitive” places like schools.

Hawai‘i state lawmakers, who kicked off the 2026 session on Wednesday, are considering a bill that would restore protections for sensitive locations, Sablan said.

It’s one of several bills The Legal Clinic and other immigration-focused organizations will be tracking, including measures that would require clear identification and bar masks for public-facing law enforcement, create a statewide framework for “U” and “T” visa certification for noncitizens who are victims of crime and human trafficking, and prevent “287g agreements” that would deputize local officers to carry out civil immigration enforcement.

In her line of work, Sablan often hears comments that if people were here legally, they wouldn’t have anything to worry about. However, she thinks “there’s a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of how much has changed” to make legal immigration pathways more difficult to obtain, and in some cases, revoking legal status of people already here.

Regardless of their status, Sablan pointed out, everybody “has basic due process rights and a right to a fair hearing, and they should have a right to legal representation.” Federal immigration court is the only court people don’t have the right to a public defender, she pointed out.

The argument that only “the worst” criminals are being taken off the streets doesn’t align with the data, and she said she has to “fundamentally disagree with the argument that it’s worth it to violate the rights of all.”

“If one person’s due process rights are violated, nobody really can feel safe believing that the same couldn’t happen to them,” Sablan said.

On Maui, if someone is detained, groups like Maui Rapid Response, another member of El Pueblo en Acción Maui, step in to help connect their families to services, especially if the person taken was the “sole breadwinner.”

“We’re looking at things like rent, we’re looking at child care, we’re looking at just housing in general, transportation,” said Nicole Huguenin, executive director of Maui Rapid Response.

The organization leads several community initiatives that range from helping unhoused people to assisting with fire recovery. Huguenin noted that people’s needs are often intersectional, such as being both undocumented and unhoused, and she said the fear of being arrested and deported has put additional stress on people already struggling to recover from the wildfires. Nearly one-third of Lahaina’s population before the fire had been born in another country.

“What we’re really seeing across the board in all vulnerable populations of people right now is compounding traumas,” Huguenin said.

In Lahaina, an arrest in September 2024 frightened parts of the community, and the incident in September of last year reignited those fears. Since then, Goodman said all of the four other potential sightings that she’s responded to have been in Lahaina.

She said “it is especially painful” to see people experiencing a moment when they know ICE is coming for them after being a contributing member of the community they’ve lived in for years.

Goodman spent 15 years working with a program that escorted women safely to abortion clinics in Queens, New York, so she’s “no stranger” to encounters with police or protesters shouting in her face. If ICE agents are “yanking people out of cars,” her sentiment is “put me in, coach.” But when she responds on Maui, her main focus is making sure her presence doesn’t make things worse for the people she’s trying to help.

Goodman said if the crackdown was about doing things the right way, ICE wouldn’t be showing up to detain people at their immigration hearings or sweeping kids out of school.

“The right way does not involve terrorizing people who are doing all of the right things,” Goodman said. “…There is no right way in this moment in time, because we’ve designed a system that is terrorizing everybody.”",https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2026/01/50044713306_cff977c927_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 15:57:15.712535

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.
The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""
It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown.
It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown.","The U.S. government is nearing the brink of a partial shutdown by the end of the week after federal immigration agents shot and killed a U.S. citizen in Minnesota on Saturday, the second such incident this month.

The Senate is set to vote this week on a massive House-passed $1.2 trillion package to fund the Department of Homeland Security, along with a wide swath of government, before the Jan. 30 deadline. But the shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is now threatening to derail the funding package as a growing chorus of Democrats warns they will oppose it unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is stripped out.

""I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,"" said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and helped end last year's 43-day shutdown, on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown,"" he said.

King's comments significantly raise the likelihood of a shutdown over DHS funding by the end of the week. He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.

The House of Representatives, which left Washington last week for a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would need to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It's unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or will do so.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.

""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday night.

The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure. Of the 47, two are independents who caucus with Democrats.

Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury.

But Pretti's death is rapidly galvanizing Democratic opposition to the measure.

""No, I am not voting for this funding,"" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.""

The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier in the week that the ""suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray said on X Saturday. ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""

It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up.

It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats.

DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" law passed last summer.

But that's far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end a record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.

""I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,"" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown. ""Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown.

“Yes, it’s a problem that Iran is the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism.
Machado said Iran and Venezuela were bound by deep cooperation between their rulers, even as people in both countries rise up against repression.
“Finally in Venezuela we’re seeing President Trump making a tremendous important decision,” she said.
“If the people of Iran were free, the contributions they could make to science, culture, and technology would be extraordinary,” he said.","The non-profit Jewish Institute for National Security of America, founded in 1976, advocates for a strong US military relationship with Israel and researches conflict in the Middle East.

JINSA president and CEO Michael Makovsky and the group’s vice president for policy Blaise Misztal told Iran International’s English-language podcast Eye for Iran that decades of containment, deterrence and nuclear diplomacy have failed because the Islamic Republic itself should be destroyed.

“It should be US policy to seek the collapse of this regime,” Makovsky said.

They said hesitation now — after mass killings of protesters across Iran — risks emboldening Tehran at the theocracy's weakest moment.

“We don’t say regime change,” Makovsky said. “The regime will fall … only when the Iranian people bring it down. But it should be US policy … to seek the collapse of this regime.”

The last months, Misztal said, have created a rare strategic opening: Iran’s nuclear clock has been set back, its regional proxies weakened and Iranians themselves have returned to the streets demanding freedom.

“This is a moment like no other,” he said. “I don’t know when the stars will align like this again… why not make it now? When is a better time than now?”

The duo urged the Trump administration to abandon negotiations, intensify pressure on the Revolutionary Guards and build the infrastructure needed to help Iranians defeat the Islamic Republic.

Misztal said previous administrations focused on Iran’s nuclear program, terrorism sponsorship and ballistic missile development as separate threats without tying them back to what he called the ideological nature of the theocracy.

“Yes, it’s a problem that Iran is the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, it is a problem that it’s pursuing nuclear weapons,” he said. “But all of that stems from it being the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

Trump’s Promises and a Moment of Decision

Their warnings come as President Donald Trump faces rising scrutiny over his own rhetoric. Earlier this month, Trump vowed support for protesters and issued a direct warning to Tehran.

“I tell the Iranian leaders: You better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting, too,” he said.

But Makovsky warned that after mass killings and widespread arrests, the absence of immediate consequences risks damaging US credibility.

“The Iranians have called his bluff for now,” he said. “If he doesn’t do it, it will go down as a tragic mistake.”

In recent days, Trump has said a US ""armada"" is heading toward the Middle East, with the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers expected to arrive in the region soon as Washington signals it is positioning military assets amid escalating uncertainty.

The growing tensions are now rippling far beyond Iran itself.

Major European airlines have begun suspending flights across parts of the Middle East, citing security concerns. Air France has canceled flights to Tel Aviv and Dubai, British Airways has halted evening service to Dubai and KLM has suspended routes to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Industry officials say cancellations are expected to increase gradually as carriers reassess airspace restrictions and passenger safety in a rapidly deteriorating regional environment.

A Cold War–Style Pressure Campaign

Misztal framed the strategy as a modern version of what the United States pursued against Soviet communism: strengthening civil resistance while weakening the ruling system from within.

“The strategy of regime collapse has been precisely what the United States pursued throughout the Cold War,” he said.

He argued that Washington should encourage defections, isolate elites in authority, cut off funding streams and expand opposition communications.

“One of the things we recommended is a quarantine of Iran’s oil exports,” Misztal said, “so that it doesn’t keep getting the money to rebuild its forces to pay the Basij or the IRGC.”

Both analysts warned that Iran’s leadership is entering what they described as its most dangerous phase, amid mass violence at home and the potential for war abraod.

“A showdown of some kind” is coming, Misztal said, and “the next showdown will be the last one.""

The warnings would mark a sharp uptick in rhetoric on Iraq by the administration of US President Donald Trump as it pursues its maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against its Mideast arch-nemesis Iran.

Citing three Iraqi officials and a source familiar with the matter, the news agency reported that US Charge d'Affaires in Baghdad Joshua Harris conveyed the warnings in conversations over the past two months with Iraqi officials from across its fractured political spectrum.

Iran relies closely on the banking sector its Western neighbor, where recent parliamentary polls kept Shi'ite Muslim parties in the ascendant and delivered gains for politicians from the kaleidoscope of militias and parties backed by Tehran.

The Islamic Republic's own economic lifeline of oil exports is under heavy pressure from US sanctions, even if export levels remain buoyant one year into Trump's second term, and Iraqi financial instruments help it skirt US curbs.

Following a 2003 US invasion, the United States has maintained de facto control over Iraqi oil revenues and its preponderant banking and financial puts the funds within its reach.

""The United States supports Iraqi sovereignty, and the sovereignty of every country in the region,"" Reuters quoted a US State Department spokesperson as saying in response to a request for comment. ""That leaves absolutely no role for Iran-backed militias that pursue malign interests, cause sectarian division, and spread terrorism across the region.""

US warnings also broached cutting off engagement with Baghdad if 58 members of parliament Washington views as linked to Iran are elevated by Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani to cabinet positions.

""The American line was basically that they would suspend engagement with the new government should any of those 58 MPs be represented in cabinet,"" Reuters quoted an Iraqi officials as saying.

""They said it meant they wouldn't deal with that government and would suspend dollar transfers,"" the source added.

Forming the new cabinet is due to take months and the US moves did not appear to be linked to a recent deadly crackdown on protestors in Iran, which resulted in new US sanctions on Iranian officials and oil shipping networks.

Machado said Iran and Venezuela were bound by deep cooperation between their rulers, even as people in both countries rise up against repression.

“The Iranian people, the Venezuelan people, we are fighting the same struggle,” she said. “These regimes have been cooperating for many years, exchanging resources, information, technology, agents and weapons.”

She said authoritarian governments help each other bypass pressure and maintain control, while democracies often stop at statements.

“Dictators help each other, they exchange technology, resources, they help each other bypass sanctions and they support each other in international forums,” Machado said. “Democratic governments stay at statements and declarations that at the end do not serve the people.”

Machado said people in Iran had reached a breaking point and were calling on the world to respond.

“We reach a point where the people start asking the world to react and to support,” she said. “What we are asking for is to stop the killings and to save lives.”

She criticized what she described as double standards among democratic governments that condemn repression while maintaining economic ties.

“You sign declarations talking about freedom and equality and respect for human rights, then you do business with these regimes,” Machado said. “You buy oil from these regimes and you keep their assets and resources in your own financial systems.”

Praise for Trump action

Machado praised Donald Trump for taking decisive action against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and said it showed what firm leadership could achieve.

“Finally in Venezuela we’re seeing President Trump making a tremendous important decision,” she said. “Bringing a criminal to justice is precisely what the world needs.”

She said the move sent a signal beyond Venezuela.

“It has brought a lot of hope,” Machado said. “This is a milestone.”

Machado said repression continues when dictators see little cost in using force.

“When you’re dealing with criminals, the only way they will leave is when the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving,” she said.

She said opposition movements cannot succeed alone without coordinated international pressure.

“We have done everything that any civic movement can do and they are killing us,” Machado said. “What we are asking for is applying law enforcement and cutting the resources they use to fund repression.”

Machado said the fall of Iran’s ruling system would have consequences far beyond the country.

“Imagine how the world will look once the Iranian criminal regime falls,” she said. “This is a unique moment in history.”

She said cooperation among opposition groups and diasporas was essential.

“These regimes help each other, and we the people need to connect and coordinate,” Machado said. “Regardless of how far away we are, we are united in this aspiration.”

“I can only speak for myself. I don’t need any more reminding about how bad this regime is and that somebody better do something about it, because if it’s not us, nobody’s going to do anything about it,” Levin said.

Levin said recent reports of increased US military deployments to the region suggested Washington was keeping its options open, although he said he had no insight into whether military action was being considered.

“Most revolutions, including America’s own, needed outside help,” he said. “What is happening in Iran is a counter-revolution against a regime that rules by force and fear.”

Levin also criticized decades of US engagement with Tehran, arguing that successive administrations believed the Islamic Republic could be managed through negotiations.

“This is an ideological regime,” he said. “They talk, they negotiate, but they have no intention of abandoning their mission, and that is why they so brutally suppress their own people.”

Iran has faced widespread internet disruptions during renewed unrest, with only limited information reaching the outside world through satellite connections and virtual private networks.

“I can tell you that tens of millions of Americans stand with the people of Persia. There’s no question about it,” Levin said. “We know the regime there is Hitleresque, Nazi-like. The regime is slaughtering innocent people, especially young people, raping them, and pillaging towns. We know that regime is the enemy of the American people. They’ve made that abundantly clear.”

Iran International has reported that at least 12,000 people have been killed since the protests began, while CBS News has cited estimates placing the death toll as high as 20,000.

Sources told Iran International on Wednesday that hospitals and morgues are facing shortages of body bags, forcing authorities to store bodies in corridors and other areas.

“We know they still want to build nuclear weapons. They back terrorism in our country, throughout Europe, and across the Middle East, but the people they terrorize the most are the Persian people,” Levin said. “I feel horrible about what’s taking place, and all I can do is use my platforms to draw as much attention to this as I can.”

Levin said Iranians possess a long civilizational history distinct from other countries in the region and said those who emigrate to the United States often integrate successfully and contribute to American society.

“If the people of Iran were free, the contributions they could make to science, culture, and technology would be extraordinary,” he said. “Instead, they are focused on survival under repression.”","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/7eea978ab07f845b332619a09d88a117c583a2f9-1920x1005.jpg?rect=3,0,1914,1005&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2026-01-25 11:58:11.735759

The US president’s sabre-rattling may also have shaken the faith of his own Republican party.

Trump’s fleeting threat to conquer the Danish territory prompted the most strident Republican opposition to anything he has done since taking office a year ago. It came on the heels of challenges to his authority over military powers, healthcare legislation and the Jeffrey Epstein files.

The mini-rebellion suggests that a small but vocal minority of Republicans feel increasingly emboldened to speak out against a 79-year-old leader who, for all his dominance of the party, is polling dismally and could drag them down in November’s midterm elections.

“You’ve never had a president with this much influence and this much political and legislative success so in that sense he’s winning but his own party is starting to question and wonder out loud at what cost?” said Frank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster. “He has been the most influential president since Franklin Roosevelt but the public and even people in his own party are starting to wonder whether it’s too much.”

Speculating over Trump’s grip on the Republican party, and whether it shows any sign of slipping, has been a political sport for a decade, producing many false dawns along the way. Dissenting senators and representatives such as Liz Cheney have been ruthlessly purged or made to feel they have no alternative but retirement.

Trump’s biggest crisis came with his crushing defeat in the 2020 presidential election and a subsequent insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the US Capitol, prompting even loyalists such as Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy to condemn him. But not even an attempted coup was enough to break the party’s cult-like fever.

Much-hyped pretenders to the crown such as the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, could not compete and, when Trump roared back from four criminal cases to win the 2024 presidential election, Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives and Senate and felt vindicated in sticking with their idol.

For much of Trump’s first year in office they gave the president such free rein on government downsizing, immigration enforcement and trade tariffs that critics said Congress had abdicated its responsibility, in effect setting up Trump as a monarch.

But there have been blips. In November four House Republicans – Marjorie Taylor Greene, Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace – took a rare stand against Trump by signing a discharge petition to force a vote to release federal files related to sex offender Epstein.

Despite months of lobbying against the release, Trump abruptly changed course and announced his support for the bill after it became clear the vote would succeed with potentially dozens of Republicans joining Democrats in support.

Greene, once among Trump’s staunchest allies, resigned from Congress and accused the president of betraying his “America First” base and prioritising elites over his supporters’ concerns. In a New York Times Magazine profile, she described herself as “naive” for initially believing Trump was a true “man of the people”.

Earlier this month more than a dozen House Republicans defied leadership by voting for a Democratic bill to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years without any restrictions. The party has also been scrambling in both chambers to narrowly fend off war powers resolutions intended to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in military action overseas.

Meanwhile Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year’s Republican incumbents, has criticised “excessive” tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.

Tara Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, perceived fractures. “I don’t think it’s as ironclad as it once was, evidenced by the Massies and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes and a few others who have begun to question the America First commitment of Donald Trump. Before, you wouldn’t have seen any of that; now you’re starting to see pockets of it.”

She added: “Whether that’s culminates into a larger rebellion remains to be seen because it is a midterm election year and these politicians want to stay in office so they’re going to continue to watch how the public reacts to Donald Trump’s decision-making and behaviour, which has been rather alarming and erratic. He’s showing signs of wear, his age – all of those things combined are becoming more difficult for rank-and-file Republicans to defend and the polling shows that.”

Few Republicans publicly dissented from the successful operation to capture Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela and many actively cheered it. But Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about seizing Greenland – threatening tariffs on European allies and refusing to rule out taking it by force – was seen by some as a bridge too far.

The Republican senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats on a bipartisan trip to Denmark. Other Republicans took part in meetings in Washington with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.

Murkowski and others pushed legislation that would prohibit Pentagon funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other Nato members without their consent. On the Senate floor, the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned that any attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies” and tarnish Trump’s legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.

Tillis directed his criticism at Trump advisers such as the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, rather than the president himself. “The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.

The most outspoken was Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, who told the Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump’s impeachment – something he would “lean” towards supporting.

It was notable, however, that McConnell, Tillis and Bacon have all announced that they will retire at the end of their current terms and therefore had little to lose by alienating Trump. Indeed the number of Republicans who broke ranks was perhaps less striking than the number who remained silent.

Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Given the gravity of Trump’s behaviour and the global consequences of his decision-making just in the last few weeks, the fact that there hasn’t been a Republican rebellion once again speaks volumes about the cowardice that got us into this position in the first place.

“He has to be reined in and the only people who can rein him in are the Republicans in Congress. Even with them facing electoral slaughter in November, they have yet to come together and work with Democrats to rein in Donald Trump.”

An Emerson College national poll this week found that 43% of likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing while 51% disapprove. Looking ahead to the midterms, 48% support the Democratic candidate on the generic congressional ballot and 42% plan on voting for the Republican candidate.

Trump himself is barred by the constitution from running for president again. Several shops that sell Trump campaign merchandise have recently announced that they are closing down. Next year the Republican political conversation will inexorably turn to the search for his successor, rendering him a lame duck with diminishing influence over the party.

Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “I don’t see a lot of evidence that many Republicans are willing to break publicly with him. But there’s clearly a sense of unease spreading in Republican ranks as they contemplate running for election or re-election in an environment defined by increasing public discontent with the Trump presidency as revealed by all the standard indices.

“If the traditional relationship between presidential approval and the party’s fortunes in the midterm elections holds true then the Republicans are in for a rough November. They know that. They can’t break with the president but they can subtly distance themselves from him and I suspect that, unless the president’s numbers pick up substantially, that is exactly what they’re going to do.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eadc4d8d78059979bb5e63463343742ee27deb55/720_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab0747aa4db9eafa5b59b67e7b32a32f",N,,2026-01-25 09:57:47.943177

Most people in the Great Room of Moscow’s 1912 Center raised their hands when asked if they, their parents or their grandparents were born in another country.

That’s how Joann Muneta, chair of the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, opened Saturday’s talk, “Immigration: An American Experience,” at the group’s 33rd annual human rights breakfast honoring Martin Luther King Jr.

The event, which filled to capacity with attendees joining both in-person and via Zoom, also featured the presentation of the 2026 Rosa Parks Achievement Awards and music by Gefilte Trout.

But Raquel Reyes, the event’s keynote speaker and director of programs and operations for PODER of Idaho, a Latinx advocacy group, posed her own question.

“Is it your experience, or are you finally being exposed to what we live with on a daily basis?” Reyes asked the majority-white crowd. “For the allies trying to save us, trying to deter the enforcement of these unlawful policies, I appreciate that. But it’s not your experience.”

Reyes recounted heart-wrenching stories: her father helping his mother and younger siblings cross the Rio Grande on inflatable tubes; the border barring her Apache grandfather from freely visiting ancestral lands; the father of her children seized and sentenced to three years detention; the daily blessing she gives her undocumented husband with the hope he comes home safe every night.

“The border crossed our family, we didn’t cross the border,” Reyes said. “We have to fight the propaganda that convinces communities that immigrants are dangerous and must be deported.”

Just minutes before the breakfast began, news broke that Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, died after being shot by a U.S. Border Patrol officer. Pretti was the third person shot, and second killed, by federal officers in 17 days as anti-immigration enforcement protests continue in Minneapolis.

The shootings have enhanced fears that legal residents and citizens are not safe from President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

For Reyes, who was born in Los Angeles and whose family has always been a mix of citizens, legal residents and undocumented immigrants, this fear is nothing new.

“We have people doing it the right way, but they’re still being detained and deported and arrested and held in detention centers,” Reyes said. “We have to fight back.”

To change the climate in our country, Reyes said, voting in every single election is critical.

“We can register voters endlessly, but the real difference is made when they actually go to the polls,” Reyes said. “Start a carpool. Get people to vote. Educate and inform them. It’s not political, it’s humanity. Being humane – we’ve lost that in America.”

Reyes also called on the crowd to make their voices heard.

“I need you to call our legislators, to write letters, to email them. Everything you can do to let them know their constituents are not happy. Until we really push back, nothing is going to change in Idaho,” Reyes said. “I’m brown. They don’t want to hear me, but they will listen to you.”

The Human Rights Task Force will post a recording of the event on its website at humanrightslatah.org. A related celebration of King’s teachings, “A Testament of Hope,” will be held Sunday at 4 p.m. at Trinity Lutheran Church in Pullman, followed by a light meal.",https://cdn.favs.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1000050895-1030x476.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 10:59:44.692653

Federal agents have shot and killed US citizen Alex Pretti during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the federal government cannot be trusted to lead the probe

The US Department of Homeland Security claimed the man was armed during his struggle with the officers

Pretti's family rejected the narrative as 'reprehensible and disgusting,' saying videos show he was not holding a gun

Family of man killed by agent slams Trump administration's 'sickening lies'

The family of Alex Pretti on Sunday released a statement in which they expressed their grief and anger over his killing, saying they were ""heartbroken"" and describing Pretti as a ""kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,"" adding, ""Alex wanted to make a difference in this world.""

The Trump administration, as was the case in the January 7 killing of unarmed US citizen Renee Good by ICE officers, has asserted that Pretti was a left-wing radical bent on ambushing and killing as many officers as possible. The authorities have not provided evidence to back the claim.

In turn, the family said Pretti's final act was ""to protect a woman"" who was being manhandled by ICE agents.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,"" they said.

""Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.""

Despite these references to ICE, Pretti was in fact shot by the US Border Patrol agent. This agency is typically active in areas close to the border, but has been working increasingly close with its sister agency, ICE, under the current Trump administration, leading to both agencies being deployed in Minneapolis.

The family ended its statement with a plea: ""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

What do we know about Minneapolis shooting victim Alex Pretti?

The man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Saturday, 37-year-old US citizen Alex Jeffrey Pretti, was an intensive care unit nurse at a local veteran affairs hospital, according to his family and colleagues.

A hospital colleague of Pretti's, Dimitri Drekonja, who heads the Infectious Diseases Section, called him ""a good kind person who lived to help.""

In a post on the Bluesky social media platform, he said Pretti worked ""to support critically ill Veterans.""

Pretti's father was cited by The Associated Press as saying that his son had been deeply disturbed by the actions of federal immigration officials in Minneapolis, and had taken part in anti-ICE protests triggered by the death of another US citizen, Renee Good, in the city at the hands of a federal officer on January 7.

""He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests,"" Michael Pretti said.

AP's report said he was born in Illinois, and was an avid lover of outdoor life.

His family saying his contact with law enforcement had previously been limited to a handful of traffic tickets.

Correction: A previous version of this entry stated that Pretti was shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, rather than a Border Patrol officer. This has now been corrected. We apologize for the error.

Democrats threaten shutdown after Minneapolis shooting

Wesley Dockery Editor

Several Democratic senators have said they will not pass upcoming federal government spending bills after the shooting of a second US citizen in Minneapolis by federal agents, meaning that a government shutdown next week has become increasingly likely.

The current funding for large parts of the federal government expires on January 31.

The funding, which would go partly to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Pentagon, has been passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives through September but will require Democratic support to get through the 100-member Senate with the required majority of 60 votes.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Saturday that ""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.""

Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from the state of Nevada was one of those who said they would vote against the funding for the DHS.

She accused the Trump administration and DHS chief Kristi Noem of ""putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability.""

Another Democratic senator, Mark Warner of Virginia, also said he would not approve the DHS funding following the shooting death in Minneapolis.

""I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities,"" he wrote on a post on X.

The last government shutdown, the longest in US history at 43 days, ended only in November.

Such shutdowns mean that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed, with only those deemed essential being asked to work on without pay.

Bondi blames Minneapolis's sanctuary city policies after second fatal shooting of resident

US Attorney General Pam Bondi has echoed the White House's line that Minnesota's authorities and their immigration policies have to do with the shooting that killed a Minneapolis man, Alex Pretti.

Speaking during an interview with Fox News, Bondi said the unrest in the city was ""because you have a mayor, you have a governor who has declared Minneapolis a 'sanctuary city.'""

A sanctuary city is a loosely defined term referring to a municipality that limits its cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law.

Proponents of the approach say sanctuary cities help build community trust and improve public safety, while critics argue that they undermine federal law and encourage illegal immigration.

Bondi claimed that Minnesota was stopping ICE from detaining immigrants who have allegedly been charged with violent crimes.

What Pam Bondi said

""Federal law enforcement agents are doing heroic work to remove the worst of the worst in Minnesota — and they’re only there in the first place because of [Minnesota Governor Tim] Walz, [Minnesota Attorney General Keith] Ellison, and [Minneapolis Mayor Jacob] Frey’s dangerous sanctuary policies,"" Bondi posted on X.

She aaccused the state's leaders of ""creating the conditions for violence against law enforcement."" ""NOTHING will stop us from enforcing the law — and NOTHING will stop President Trump from protecting the good people of Minnesota,"" Bondi said.

During the interview with Fox News, Bondi said the Justice Department had sent a ""very strong letter"" to Walz, in which she told him he ""better support President Trump, he better support the men and women in law enforcement, because if he doesn't, we are.""

Shooting is the third involving federal officers in under three weeks — a timeline

This is the third shooting incident in Minnesota involving federal immigration agents in less than three weeks:

Saturday's shooting occurred just blocks from where Renee Good was killed on January 7

The White House labeled Good, a mother and a poet with no criminal record, a 'domestic terrorist' who was shot because she tried to hit a federal officer with her vehicle

Minnesota and Minneapolis authorities have strongly rejected the White House's version of events

Good's shooting further raised tensions in the state amid the crackdown by federal immigration authorities

There have been daily clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Minnesota since Good was killed

On January 15, a federal officer shot a person in the leg during an attempted arrest

The Department of Homeland Security said the officer had fired the shot 'fearing for his life and safety' as he was being attacked with a shovel and a broom handle

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard to assist local police amid growing protests in the city after the fatal shooting of a man by immigration agents.

National Guard troops will be deployed to the site of the shooting in Minneapolis and the city's federal building.

In a post on X, Minneapolis authorities said the Guard was to be deployed as local police resources ""are already stretched thin because of public safety disruptions federal immigration agents have caused.""

Minneapolis city authorities added that Guard troops would wear neon vests to ""distinguish them from other agencies.""

Local officials said the deployment comes ""at the request"" of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Maine governor demands Trump withdraw 'reckless' ICE agents from state

The governor of the state of Maine, Janet Mills, issued a statement saying she is ""appalled and heartbroken"" by ""yet another killing at the hands of federal immigration enforcement.""

Mills said President Donald Trump's and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem's ""weaponization of federal law enforcement"" is both a ""grave violation of the Constitution"" as well as a ""threat to the lives of law-abiding people in the cities and states they occupy, including Maine.""

The DHS said Friday that ICE agents had arrested over 100 ""illegal aliens"" since a federal immigration crackdown began three days earlier in the state.

In her statement, Mills said she had requested a meeting with Trump to demand the withdrawal of ""these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave danger to public safety.""

She also urged Congress to cut off funding for ICE and to ""immediately"" bring Noem before a public hearing.

Noem blames Tim Walz, Jacob Frey for ongoing clashes after today's shooting

More now from Kristi Noem, who said ""about hundreds"" of protesters showed up at the scene after the shooting.

""They began to construct and assault law enforcement officers,"" Noem said, adding that they threw objects, ""including ice,"" at the agents.

""An agent's finger was bitten off,"" Noem claimed.

The DHS secretary then blamed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for encouraging violence against law enforcement officers.

""The Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor need to take a long, hard look in the mirror,"" Noem said. ""They need to evaluate their rhetoric, their conversations, and their encouragement of such violence.""

Noem said Walz had said the officers were ""not law enforcement, which is a lie; he has called them the Gestapo, he has encouraged residents and citizens and violent rioters to resist.""

While Walz has likened the federal immigration agents to a ""modern-day Gestapo,"" the governor has repeatedly urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully. The Gestapo was the official secret police of Nazi Germany.

Noem also accused Walz of refusing ""to turn over murderers to federal law enforcement officers, he has protected illegal criminals and protected them from being brought to justice.""

She said that Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Frey, instead of cooperating with federal immigration enforcement, ""choose violence, choose to encourage the destruction of their city.""

""It appears they want this lawlessness to continue; it appears they want chaos to distract from the theft and fraud and corruption in this city,"" Noem said.

The White House has withheld millions of dollars in aid to daycare centers in Minnesota amid unproven allegations of fraud.

DHS says man shot dead aimed 'to kill law enforcement'

Kristi Noem, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has given a press conference in the wake of the shooting of a US citizen by federal officers in Minnesota.

Noem claimed that the man had ""approached US border patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun"" and had ""reacted violently"" when the officers tried to disarm him.

Noem said an agent, who was ""fearing for his life and the life of his fellow officers,"" fired ""defensive shots.""

""The suspect also had two magazines with ammunition in them that held dozens of rounds. He also had no ID,"" Noem continued.

""This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement,"" she said.

Clashing narratives

Noem's description of the incident appears to contradict several videos from the scene filmed by protesters that have been published on social media.

Those videos appear to show a man holding a phone to film the agents' operation and trying to intervene when they start shoving another person.

After multiple agents confront the man, he is wrestled to the ground, before several shots are fired.

At no point is the man seen pulling his weapon or aiming it at the officers.

What have federal authorities said about the shooting?

Federal authorities have said that a 37-year-old man shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday morning had ""violently resisted arrest"" before his death.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said that the man had been armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun which led to a federal agent firing ""defensive shots.""

""This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,"" the statement read.

In a press conference later on Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino reiterated parts of the statement and added that the officer who carried out the shooting was a ""highly trained"" border patrol agent with 8 years of experience.

According to the account, the man approached officers as they were carrying out ""targeted"" immigration enforcement operations against a separate individual who they said was in the United States illegally.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump sought to portray the shooting as a ""cover-up"" for state fraud scandals without providing details on how the events could be linked in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Local and state officials cast doubt on federal account of shooting

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz cast doubt on the federal government's account of the shooting and insisted the state be allowed to carry out its own investigation into the incidents.

He accused federal agencies of trying to ""spin a narrative"" on the shooting ""before any investigation is done.""

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said that federal agencies had not provided details on the shooting with local police, but said that a purported video of the incident circulating on social media — which shows masked men who appear to be federal agents kicking and punching someone on the ground before gunshots are heard — ""speaks for itself.""

Family members identified the man killed in a shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Saturday morning as a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veteran Affairs hospital, according to the Associated Press.

The report comes after Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said in a Saturday press conference that a 37-year-old man was killed, but declined to identify him.

The man's father was cited in the report as saying that his son was upset by the federal immigration enforcement crackdown in Minneapolis and had participated in anti-ICE protests following the killing of Renee Good by a federal officer on January 7.

The man was a US citizen born in the Midwestern state of Illinois, according to the report.

Minnesota officials had previously stated that the man was a Minneapolis resident and was believed to be a US citizen.

Family members cited by the report said that he owned a handgun and had a concealed carry permit for the state of Minnesota, but added that they had never known him to carry it.

The Department of Homeland Security said he had approached federal officers armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun before he was shot dead.

Local and state officials have disputed the account, with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accusing the federal government of ""spinning stories"" before an investigation is conducted.

But far-right groups have been responding favourably to the social media recruitment campaign, recirculating the posts on their own social media channels.
But when asked by U.S.-based media about its social media posts, DHS has denied it was referring to white supremacist material.","At first glance, there may not appear to be anything unusual about the social media posts that are part of the ongoing recruitment drive by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The posts, which encourage Americans to join ICE, use the same aggressively patriotic imagery that’s become a hallmark of the Trump administration’s online communications.

But to observers of the far-right, and to members of the far-right themselves, there is something else that is recognizable in the language of the posts.

""I would describe it as oddly very familiar as someone who has been looking at the white nationalist and neo-Nazi movement for nearly a decade now,"" said Hannah Gais, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Centre, a non-profit that monitors right-wing extremism.

""It's disturbing to see that coming from a government agency.""

Gais is among several U.S. ex perts tracking a series of references in the ICE recruitment posts that, while obscure to most, seem to be wink ing to extremists.

That’s raised the question: Who, exactly, is ICE trying to recruit?

Invoking non-fiction book popular with neo-Nazis

In the year since returning to power, U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen a dramatic expansion to ICE, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for enforcing immigration within the country.

Trump has set a goal of deporting one million people per year. But as ICE has ramped up arrests, it has been repeatedly accused of racially profiling suspected immigrants and using excessive force in its operations.

Under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed last summer, ICE was given $8 billion US to hire thousands more agents. T he ensuing recruitment drive included social media outreach.

On Aug 11, 2025, ICE posted an image on its socials of Uncle Sam at a crossroads. It included the tag line ""Which way, American man?""

The post echoed a meme popular among right-wing influencers, who use the phrase ""Which way, Western man?"" to illustrate a choice between an image meant to represent liberal values and an image representing their own preferred option.

But the phrase itself is taken from the title of a 700-page antisemitic nonfiction book written by William Gayley Simpson and published by a neo-Nazi press in the late 1970s.

The book has long been a favourite among white supremacists.

Using white supremacist anthem

By itself, the language could have been chalked up to an unfortunate coincidence. But other troubling posts soon followed.

In October, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, posted an image of George Washington on horseback with the URL to the ICE recruitment page. This time the tag line read ""America for Americans.""

It’s a slogan that was used in a xenophobic speech by President Theodore Rosevelt in 1916, before being picked up by the Klu Klux Klan, according to America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States by Harvard history professor Erika Lee.

Not long after, DHS borrowed imagery from the popular video game Halo, writing ""destroy the flood"" atop an armed vehicle.

In the world of the video game, the flood refers to a parasitic alien lifeform. It’s also reminiscent of the language far-right groups use to describe non-white immigrants, according to Gais.

Most recently, in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, ICE put out a recruitment post emblazoned with the line ""We’ll have our home again.""

On Instagram the post first appeared with a clip from a song of the same name by the Pine Tree Riots.

""It is a song only known in white nationalist circles,"" said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.

Since 2020, the song has been circulated on the messaging app Telegram almost exclusively by accounts linked to far-right extremists, according to analysis by Open Measures, a research firm that specializes in online extremism.

With lyrics about replacement by foreigners, Beirich says the song is only popular in white nationalist spaces. ""This is the kind of thing that I can't find to be a mistake,"" she said.

'Message received,' say Proud Boys

ICE says it received around 220,000 applications during its recruitment drive last year, and hired 12,000 new officers, more than doubling the size of its force.

Beirich wonders how many of those applicants were drawn by the controversial social media posts.

""The most dangerous part is that this is probably attracting white supremacists and other racial extremists to perhaps join the ranks of ICE. And that is a very toxic, very dangerous situation if it's happening,"" she said.

There have been no recent reports of extremists infiltrating the ranks of ICE. But far-right groups have been responding favourably to the social media recruitment campaign, recirculating the posts on their own social media channels.

A Proud Boys chapter reposted the ""We’ll have our home again"" ad next to a picture of a literal dog whistle, adding the line ""message received.""

Another chapter also reposted the ad, commenting ""Hahah. If you know, you know.""

'Attracting the wrong type'

DHS did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News. But when asked by U.S.-based media about its social media posts, DHS has denied it was referring to white supremacist material.

A DHS spokesperson told The Associated Press that the ""We’ll Have Our Home Again"" post was ""a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.""

Its outreach on social media is only one part of a vast recruitment strategy by ICE.

The agency will spend $100 million US this year to target specific demographic groups, according to the Washington Post.

That includes using geo-tagging technology to deliver recruitment ads to people who attend, among other things, UFC fights and gun shows.

ICE has already spent millions running TV ads aimed at recruiting disgruntled law enforcement officers in sanctuary cities, which make public services available to undocumented immigrants.

""In sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,"" the ads say, adding ""Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst.""

David Lapan, a government communications specialist who was a DHS spokesperson during the first Trump administration, said the department appears to be trying to recruit applicants with a particular mindset.

Its messaging is appealing to people who “want to get rid of foreigners” and “bust some heads,” Lapan said.

""I think ICE is headed in the wrong direction in that they're attracting the wrong type of individual to be involved in a very serious mission that they have,"" he said.

ICE is slated to receive $30 billion by 2029 to fund its deportation efforts.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/7ba16152-63f6-4ef7-9f8a-a6bd1bb6da5b,1769206809294/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C329%2C4060%2C2283%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-25 11:58:19.141996

The Camarillo branch of American Association of University Women (AAUW Camarillo) encompasses western Ventura County communities including Oxnard, Ventura, Ojai, and up to the Santa Barbara County line. AAUW Camarillo stands in firm opposition to the harmful and discriminatory immigration enforcement practices carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

As a nonprofit committed to advancing gender equity for women and girls through research, education, and advocacy, we see the detrimental impact these actions are having across the county, specifically on women and their families. Masked agents without clear identification have violated constitutional rights to due process and have caused fear, disruption, and trauma across entire communities, trauma that will have longstanding consequences for all of us. ICE raids have had a chilling effect on community trust and well-being.

We call on local leaders to take immediate action:

Prohibit the use of masked or unidentified agents.

Enforce constitutional rights to due process.

Ensure that local law enforcement, in accordance with established city and county policies and the California Values Act (SB 54), will not assist with or participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws.

Take action to protect all individuals from acts of intimidation and aggression perpetrated by ICE agents.

Demand proof that Federal ICE agents employed by the Department of Homeland Security have undergone comprehensive training in use of force and lethal weapons.

AAUW Camarillo condemns the increasingly violent and illegal actions of federal agents, and expects immediate, meaningful action from electeds and government agencies to address this national human rights crisis, from local impacts to global implications.

We need to protect our coast

I am a junior in high school, the co-founder of Simi Valley High School’s Environmental Club, and a youth leader with Climate First: Replacing Oil & Gas (CFROG).

I am also, like many Ventura County residents, someone who loves going to the beach. When friends and family come to visit, the beach is always the first place I want to take them. This is why I was so concerned when I heard about the federal proposal for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program to open around 1.27 billion acres to new offshore drilling and create six new leases for sale off of California’s coast.

This is fueled by the passing of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” which requires a minimum of 36 oil lease sales through 2040. With the looming possibility of oil rigs dotting the waters only 3 miles off our shores, I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my family back to the beaches I grew up visiting.

We already know what could happen if this plan comes to fruition. In 1969, the infamous Santa Barbara oil spill polluted our ocean with 3 million tons of crude oil, causing environmental and economic devastation. The silver lining was that this spill spurred the first national Earth Day and an environmental movement that inspired real change. Because people came together to protect our oceans, the last federal oil lease sale in the Pacific was in 1984.

We must use our voices so that this work isn’t undone. I urge the people of Ventura County to submit comments at www.federalregister.gov/documents to protect our coast before the comment period for the Draft Proposed Program ends on Jan. 23.

Don’t let the “Beautiful Bill” destroy what’s truly beautiful: our ocean, our coast, and our community.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from a Minnesota state representative.","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday that the state will conduct its own investigation into the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents.

The big picture: This is the second time this month local law enforcement said federal agencies have refused to cooperate while investigating the shooting death of a state resident by federal officials.

Driving the news: Walz said he told the White House Saturday morning that the state's justice system ""must have the last word"" because the ""federal government cannot be trusted to handle the investigation.""

A Justice Department spokesperson told Axios that the Department of Homeland Security will lead the investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

The latest: The 37-year-old Minneapolis resident's death has further inflamed tensions over ICE's continued presence and conduct in the state.

Walz and other officials immediately called on the Trump administration to remove the thousands of immigration agents that have flooded the state in recent weeks.

The president responded with a Truth Social post accusing the mayor and governor of ""inciting Insurrection"" with their rhetoric.

What he's saying: Walz pointed to videos taken at the scene as he dismissed the administration's initial accounts of the fatal encounter as ""nonsense"" and ""lies.""

""Thank God we have video, because according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them,"" he said, accusing federal officials of ""spinning stories"" and ""rushing to judgment.""

""They're telling you not to trust your eyes and ears.""

What we know: Videos from the scene appear to show the man recording agents with a phone and attempting to help another observer as she was pushed to the ground by an agent.

He was sprayed with chemical agents and wrestled to the ground by about half a dozen agents before multiple shots rang out.

The Department of Homeland Security said the man was armed with a gun and that a Border Patrol agent opened fire as the man resisted agents' attempts to disarm him.

Videos circulating so far do not appear to show the man reaching for or brandishing the firearm in question.

Friction point: The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said on X that its investigators were ""blocked"" from the scene this morning by federal agents.

Department of Public Safety commissioner Bob Jacobson told reporters that DHS ""pulled out of the scene,"" and that his agents and officers had to leave for their own safety as the crowd of protesters grew.

State Rep. Marion Rarick, a Republican, implored federal agencies to cooperate with the local investigation.

""Honor federal search warrants. Bring peace to the chaos of our state. Bring full transparency. Bring truth. Follow the constitution. Respect everyones' rights,"" she wrote on Facebook.

Zoom out: Federal officials also blocked state investigators from accessing evidence after an ICE official shot protester Renee Good in early January, declaring that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

Local prosecutors pledged to continue to pursue their own probe in that case.

What we're watching: Minnesota Guard Commander Shawn Manke said the guard, which Walz put on standby earlier this week, has been activated to help local law enforcement provide security at a federal immigration building.

More troops remain prepared to respond throughout the metro if the situation escalates, he said.

Federal immigration agents shot and killed a Minneapolis nurse Saturday morning, marking the second fatal shooting by federal officers in the city this month and triggering a rapid cascade of court action, political condemnation, and a brewing budget crisis in Congress as Senate Democrats moved to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

The man killed, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record who worked as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti had a permit to carry a firearm, which is legal in Minnesota, but emphasized that bystander video shows Pretti holding a phone — not a weapon — at the time federal agents took him to the ground and opened fire.

Video verified by multiple news organizations shows several federal agents surrounding Pretti, forcing him to his knees, restraining him on the ground and striking him before at least two agents fired. In the footage, one agent appears to pull a gun from the scrum while another unholsters his weapon and fires into Pretti’s back at close range. At least 10 shots were fired within roughly five seconds. Pretti collapses and lies motionless as shots continue.

Federal officials say the shooting occurred during a “targeted operation” in Minneapolis connected to immigration enforcement efforts under the Trump administration.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official overseeing the operation, said agents were searching for a man accused of domestic assault and other charges, but acknowledged that Pretti was not the target of the operation.

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the shooting began after Pretti approached agents while armed and that officers perceived him as a threat. Noem said federal agents believed Pretti intended to harm law enforcement.

A senior Border Patrol official described the situation as involving a potential “massacre.”

Those accounts are sharply disputed by eyewitnesses, medical professionals, and sworn declarations filed in federal court within hours of the killing.

In a declaration submitted as part of ongoing litigation challenging federal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, a physician who witnessed the shooting from their apartment said they did not observe Pretti brandish a weapon or pose an immediate threat to agents.

The doctor stated that they rushed outside in freezing conditions to provide medical assistance, identified themselves as a physician, and initially found federal agents not administering medical aid.

The doctor’s declaration describes multiple gunshot wounds, including several to Pretti’s back, and states that federal agents initially blocked or delayed efforts to render emergency care. The physician said they attempted CPR after eventually being allowed access.

Another civilian witness, who was recording video from just feet away, stated in a sworn declaration that Pretti had approached agents with a phone and camera, not a gun, and that federal officers escalated the encounter. That witness said agents forced Pretti to the ground and shot him repeatedly while he was restrained.

Beyond the killing itself, the court filings describe federal agents preventing state and local authorities from securing the crime scene and interviewing witnesses.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security blocked BCA investigators from accessing the scene even after a search warrant was obtained. Evans said that in more than 20 years with the agency, he had never encountered federal authorities barring state investigators from a scene involving concurrent jurisdiction.

Within hours, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty filed a new federal lawsuit challenging the federal government’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation.

That same evening, U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud issued a temporary restraining order barring federal agencies from destroying or altering any evidence related to Pretti’s killing and scheduled a follow-up hearing.

The shooting has also been folded into an existing federal case challenging “Operation Metro Surge,” a Trump administration immigration enforcement initiative operating in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Plaintiffs in that case argue the operation violates First and Fourth Amendment protections and sought emergency relief after the killing.

Attorneys for Minnesota, Minneapolis, and St. Paul asked the court to halt the operation entirely, warning that if left unchecked it would continue to cause irreparable harm.

Pretti’s parents, who said they learned of their son’s death when a reporter called them, issued a statement condemning what they described as “sickening lies” told by the administration about their son. They described Pretti as kindhearted and said he had been trying to help members of his community.

The killing reignited protests in Minneapolis, where tensions had already been high following the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, 37, who was shot in the head by a federal immigration officer earlier this month. That shooting also prompted demonstrations and demands by city and state officials for federal agents to leave the city.

Political fallout spread quickly beyond Minnesota. California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of escalating federal violence, writing on social media that “Trump made a shooting happen” and calling the federal presence in Minneapolis a “violent occupation.”

Newsom urged Californians to report abuses by ICE and Customs and Border Protection to the state attorney general’s office.

U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff said the killing was another “senseless loss of life” and called for ICE agents to be removed from cities immediately.

Sen. Alex Padilla said the shooting did not make communities safer and only escalated tensions.

At the same time, the shooting triggered an unusual rupture with gun rights groups after Bill Essayli, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, posted online that approaching law enforcement with a gun carries a high likelihood officers would be legally justified in shooting.

The National Rifle Association condemned Essayli’s comment as “dangerous and wrong,” saying public officials should wait for full investigations rather than demonize law-abiding gun owners.

Gun Owners of America said federal agents are not “highly likely” to be legally justified in shooting concealed carry permit holders and warned that treating the presence of a firearm as justification for lethal force undermines constitutional rights.

Essayli later said his remarks were mischaracterized and claimed he was referring only to armed agitators refusing to disarm, but the backlash underscored fractures between the administration’s enforcement posture and traditional gun rights advocates.

In Congress, the political consequences escalated into a potential budget crisis. Senate Democrats announced they would refuse to provide the votes needed to advance legislation funding the federal government if it includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called what was unfolding in Minneapolis “appalling” and “unacceptable in any American city,” saying Democrats would block the measure unless DHS funding was separated. The legislation includes billions for DHS and roughly $10 billion for ICE.

Several Democratic senators said they could no longer support funding ICE amid repeated incidents of violence.

Sen. Mark Warner said he would not vote to fund DHS “while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said federal agents were being deployed without accountability and that the operation was “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Republicans acknowledged the funding deal was in jeopardy and began exploring whether DHS funding could be split off to avert a partial government shutdown.

Sen. Susan Collins said negotiations were ongoing but warned that rejecting the full package could jeopardize funding for multiple federal agencies.

As investigations proceed, federal officials have defended their actions as lawful and necessary, while state authorities, judges, medical witnesses, gun rights groups, and Democratic lawmakers have raised sharply different conclusions about what happened in Minneapolis and what it signals about federal power, accountability and the use of lethal force.

Hearings in multiple federal cases are scheduled in the coming days, and the killing of Alex Pretti now sits at the center of a widening legal and political confrontation that extends from a Minneapolis street corner to the halls of Congress.

5:50 p.m.: Susan Collins says Minnesota shooting ‘needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated’

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, released a statement Saturday responding to the fatal shooting of a man by ICE agents in Minneapolis, saying the incident “needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.”

“This shooting further underscores the importance of equipping federal law enforcement agents with training and body cameras for their safety and the safety of the public,” Collins said in the statement. “I urge protestors to keep space between themselves and law enforcement and not to interfere with operations.”

Collins also said it’s critical that “ICE and other federal law enforcement agents recognize both the public’s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.”

4:10 p.m.: Gov Mills requests meeting with Trump after fatal ICE-related shooting in Minneapolis

Gov. Janet Mills issued a statement Saturday afternoon demanding that President Trump withdraw federal immigration agents from Maine, after a fatal shooting in Minneapolis earlier the same day.

Mills also requested a meeting with the president.

“I am requesting that the President of the United States meet with me so that I can demand in person that his Administration withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety,” she said in the statement. “I call on Congress to immediately bring Secretary Noem before them for a public hearing and cut off any further funding for ICE until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a 37-year-old man was killed but declined to identify him. He added that information about what led up to the shooting was limited.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him. O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”

Mills said she was appalled at the violence in Minneapolis.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem’s weaponization of Federal law enforcement against the people they are meant to serve is not only a grave violation of the Constitution, but a threat to the lives of law-abiding people in the cities and states they seek to occupy, including Maine,” she wrote.

She encouraged Mainers to continue to protest peacefully.

4 p.m.: Attendance down at high school sports event as immigrant families stay away out of fear

Participation was down at Saturday’s morning track meet at the University of Southern Maine in Gorham, which featured teams from Portland, South Portland, Deering and Cheverus high schools.

Athletes whose families immigrated to the United States make up a significant portion of the rosters for the Portland, South Portland and Deering teams. Those teams had a number of athletes missing the meet on Saturday, likely related to the immigration enforcement actions this week.

Andy Schmidt, whose daughter Nora is a freshman distance runner on the Portland track team, took a video of one of Nora’s teammates running a sprint event.

“I was happy to film this race for my friend, who was too scared to come see her daughter compete, even though their family is here legally,” Schmidt said. “I understand we need to enforce immigration laws, but it doesn’t need to be this cruel.”

Adam Ramsell, whose son Caleb is a senior sprinter and jumper on the South Portland track team, said “attendance was way down” at Saturday’s meet, but it could have been even lower.

He said Caleb was one of the students who gave rides to team members who come from immigrant families. That helped minimize the chances those athletes would be targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while traveling to the meet, Ramsell said.

“It’s great to see kids stepping up, supporting and taking care of each other,” Ramsell said.

3:30 p.m.: ICE activities prompt cancelation of weekend puppet shows in Portland

Mayo Street Arts, a community performance venue in Portland’s East Bayside neighborhood, has canceled this weekend’s scheduled puppet shows due to ICE activities.

“We do not feel it is responsible to put international artists at risk,” the organization said in a Saturday afternoon email to members. “ICE is not welcome at MSA and we are implementing policies as best we can to keep our community and the artists that perform here safe.”

In the email, the center said it plans to reschedule the showings of The City That Slept, a story about a sleep-inducing deity wandering the streets of New York City by native New Zealander Tom Tuke, once circumstances in Portland have changed. Ticket holders will receive an email with specific instructions.

3 p.m.: American Legion allows ICE agents to park vehicles in its Scarborough parking lot

Reached at the post, which was in the midst of preparing for a luau celebration, American Legion Post 76 Commander Phil Caesar said he was allowing ICE agents who work at the Scarborough detention center next door to park personal vehicles in the post’s 15-space parking lot.

He said many of the agents appear to live in Scarborough and are veterans themselves.

It’s not like the two groups socialize or that members even talk, he said. It was all handled in one quick phone call, he said.

“They are a federal agency doing federally mandated work,” Caesar said. “We support ICE. That’s it.”

No one from the community or his own membership of a couple dozen have complained about the arrangement, he said.

Caesar said he thought Maine was wrong to refuse to follow federal immigration policies or interfere with ICE enforcement actions or condemn anyone for doing their job. That is why Caesar refused to allow protesters to stage an ICE protest in the post parking lot when asked last year, Caesar said.

Scarborough Democratic Town Councilor Jon Anderson said he is disappointed that the local American Legion post would allow its parking lot to be used by an organization whose recent actions violate people’s civil rights but not local residents who would exercise their free speech right to protest those violations.

Anderson said ICE’s use of the lot is proof the facility has expanded beyond its initial use as a transfer facility. In 2021, the town adopted a 2021 zoning ordinance to prevent any facility expansion, he said. Anderson said that he has asked the town manager to investigate if the facility is in violation of local zoning.

“If they’ve run out of space to park their cars, they’ve most likely expanded, which is exactly what the town took steps to avoid,” Anderson said. “Is the American Legion helping ICE violate our ordinance? I don’t know if there is such a thing as an accomplice to a zoning violation, but I would highly recommend the American Legion reconsider how they are using their land.”

1:50 p.m.: Maine’s congressional delegation begins to react to latest Minneapolis ICE-related shooting

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, discussed the latest shooting on her way to speak at the Lewiston rally on Saturday.

“My heart goes out to the family of the individual shot by ICE,” Pingree said on a message she posted to Facebook. “We have a good idea that this will be yet another unjustified killing.”

She said she was pleased the Minneapolis police would be investigating the incident so it would not be dismissed by ICE.

Pingree is likely to talk about the incident when addressing the crowd in Lewiston. “I’m so proud of Mainers for standing up and fighting for the rule of law,” Pingree said. “ICE needs to get out of our state.”

1:45 p.m.: Anti-ICE rally in Lewiston draws 1,000 protesters to Kennedy Park

LEWISTON — About 1,000 people overflowed the Angora Grand Event Center to protest the surge in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Lewiston and Maine this week.

Speaking at the protest were several local and state officials and candidates for office, including Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline; advocate and former Lewiston City Councilor Safiya Khalid; Portland Mayor Mark Dion; U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner; U.S. House District 2 candidates Matt Dunlap and Jordan Wood and gubernatorial candidates Hannah Pingree, Troy Jackson and Shenna Bellows.

Several religious leaders from Lewiston and beyond also spoke at the demonstration. Asked why she was at the rally, Lewiston resident Debbie Hillman said, “Things are terribly wrong and we need to get together.

“It’s not just one item that Trump has decided to pick, it’s this whole big umbrella of things and it’s frustrating and heartbreaking. This is emotional for me and I had to do something.”

11:15 a.m.: U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner ‘heartened’ by community opposition to ICE

U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner said he’s “heartened” to see the robust community opposition to a surge of federal immigration enforcement in Maine.

Earlier in the week, Platner urged residents to “actually fight back” against Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers through community organizing. He has accused ICE of terrorizing the community, rather than conducting a legitimate law enforcement operation.

On Friday night, hundreds of protesters marched along Congress Street and dozens of others beat on drums and blew whistles for the second straight night at hotels where ICE agents are believed to be staying.

“The rallies and the protests outside the hotels, of course, I support them immensely,” Platner said in an interview with the Press Herald on Saturday morning.

Platner said he’s proud of the rapid response teams that have formed organically in communities like Portland, Westbrook, Biddeford and Saco to record and document arrests being made by ICE agents and help people too fearful to leave their homes.

“The reason we’re seeing videos of these illegal arrests is because there are people on hand available to videotape them and then report what they’re witnessing,” Platner said. “People are doing this in their communities and then connecting with the greater networks. And I think that that’s something that we should all be proud of.”

Platner is seeking the Democratic nomination against two-term Gov. Janet Mills. The winner will take on Republican Sen. Susan Collins in the fall.

Platner is slated to speak at a rally in Lewiston this afternoon.

10:55 a.m.: More than 200 Maine faith leaders denounce ICE tactics

An open letter circulated by the Maine Council of Churches Friday condemned the tactics of ICE agents in the state. More than 200 faith leaders signed the letter, which called on ICE to end its targeting of immigrants and asylum seekers.

“Our sacred texts teach us to love the stranger and urge us toward empathy and welcome, not toward violence and bigotry,” the letter said. “Yet across our state, parents are afraid to pick up their children from school, workers are afraid to go to their jobs, and parishioners are afraid to walk home alone from worship services due to the discriminatory and unjust actions being perpetrated by ICE agents.

“This sort of terror is not welcome here. We denounce the current operation and call for its end.”

The letter encourages Mainers to report ICE activity to the statewide hotline, document incidents involving ICE agents and help the immigrant community access needed services.

10 a.m.: Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce offers advice to businesses dealing with “troubling” ICE disruption

The Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce said it has been closely following recent federal immigration enforcement activity and has heard concerns from members about how this activity is affecting their businesses.

“The manner and scope of recent immigration enforcement actions are disrupting workplaces, undermining economic stability, and adversely affecting the well-being of residents,” the organization said. “This includes members of our much-valued immigrant community, who play a significant role in the success and vitality of Greater Portland’s economy.”

Businesses rely on employees who are here legally to be able to work without unnecessary uncertainty or stress, it said.

Here is what it told its business members in an email sent out Friday night:

Businesses should designate one person to interact with ICE officers. Employee eligibility forms should be complete and securely stored. Mark non-public workplace spaces. Train front-line staff to refer agents to managers. Keep legal counsel information readily available.

Employees should carry valid immigration documents, know they have the right to stay silent and ask for a lawyer, and not to volunteer information or sign documents they do not understand.

If agents show up, stay calm and act professionally. Do not resist or obstruct officers. Limit agents’ access to public areas unless they have a judicial warrant signed by a judge. Consult a lawyer before providing documents or answering questions. Employers have three business days to respond to a notice of inspection for employee eligibility forms and related records.

“We will continue to support our members and serve as a voice for the Greater Portland business community,” the agency told its members. “In the meantime, we encourage open and constructive dialogue among federal, state, and local leaders.”

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who had protested President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in his city. After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs.

The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, officials said. Guard troops were sent to both the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.

Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation and fired ""defensive shots"" after a man with a handgun approached them and ""violently resisted"" when officers tried to disarm him.

WATCH: Thousands brave frigid cold in Twin Cities 'ICE Out' protest

In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.

O'Hara said police believe the man was a ""lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.""

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Pretti had shown up to ""impede a law enforcement operation."" She questioned why he was armed but did not offer detail about whether Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.

The officer who shot the man is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.

Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out at Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.

Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: ""What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?""

Trump, a Republican, said the Democratic governor and mayor are ""are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.""

Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7, sparking widespread protests.

Pretti's family released a statement Saturday evening saying they are ""heartbroken but also very angry,"" and calling him a kindhearted soul who wanted to make a difference in the world through his work as a nurse.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,"" the family statement said. ""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

Video shows officers, man who was shot

In a bystander video of Saturday's shooting obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on Nicollet Avenue.

The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.

The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.

The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.

Soon at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man's back and another who appears to have a canister in his hand strikes a blow to the man's chest. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.

A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it's not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.

The police chief appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement.

""Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,"" the chief said. ""We urge everyone to remain peaceful.""

Gregory Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration's big-city immigration campaign, said the officer who shot the man had extensive training as a range safety officer and in using less-lethal force.

""This is only the latest attack on law enforcement. Across the country, the men and women of DHS have been attacked, shot at,"" he said.

Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and that the state would lead the investigation into the latest fatal shooting.

But Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the shooting scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

Amid the unrest, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will not vote for a spending package that includes money for DHS. Schumer's statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down on Jan. 30 when funding runs out.

Protests continue in Minneapolis

Protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather.

At midday Saturday, the worst of an extreme cold wave was over, but the temperature was still -6 degrees (-21 Celsius).

After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them ""cowards"" and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: ""Boo hoo."" Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car. Protesters dragged garbage dumpsters from alleyways to block the streets, and people who gathered chanted, ""ICE out now"" and ""Observing ICE is not a crime.""

As dark fell, hundreds of people gathered quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting. Some carried signs saying ""Justice for Alex Pretti."" Others chanted Pretti's and Good's names. A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.

Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration. ""It feels like every day something crazier happens,"" he said. ""What's happening in our community is wrong, it's sickening, it's disgusting.""

The age of the man who was shot has been corrected to 37, per information from the police chief. The AP previously reported his age as 51 based on a hospital record.

The incident was one of five shootings in January involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good. At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention, an unusually rapid pace.

The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement with $170 billion budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

Minneapolis has become the focus of the Republican president’s crackdown this month, with some 3,000 agents deployed. Thousands of protesters took to the streets despite sub-zero temperatures on Friday to voice opposition to Trump’s enforcement and demand he withdraw the agents, which Minnesota officials have called an occupation.

Trump has argued the militarized operations are necessary to remove criminals from the U.S., but many of those arrested were picked up solely for possible civil immigration violations - the legal equivalent to a traffic violation.

Here is a closer look at the deaths from federal immigration enforcement and the often-conflicting accounts of what happened in each case.

FATAL SHOOTINGS IN MINNESOTA

The man killed in Minneapolis on Saturday was a U.S. citizen, identified in news reports as Alex Pretti, 37, a registered nurse and lawfully permitted gun owner.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent fired at the man, who resisted agents' attempts to disarm him, but local leaders challenged that account.

In bystander videos verified by Reuters, agents are seen pepper spraying Pretti and other protesters as he films them with his cellphone. No weapon is visible. After multiple agents wrestle him to the ground, one draws his weapon and multiple shots can be heard.

The shooting followed Good’s death earlier this month, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle.

Within hours of that shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist” who tried to ram the ICE officer with her car, although the department has not presented evidence of a link to terrorism. Video shows Ross fired as Good's car moved past him.

ICE, BORDER PATROL FIRING AT SUSPECTS

Federal agents have been involved in three other shootings this month during immigration actions.

The day after Good’s death, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man and woman in Portland, Oregon, after what DHS called “a targeted vehicle stop.”

DHS said the driver, Venezuelan immigrant Luis Nino-Moncada, attempted to run over the agents before the agent fired, wounding Nino-Moncada and his passenger, a Venezuelan woman.

The Justice Department later charged Nino-Moncada with assaulting an officer. His passenger, Yorlenys Zambrano-Contreras, pleaded guilty this week to entering the U.S. illegally in 2023.

On January 15, an ICE agent shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg in Minneapolis after DHS said he fled authorities.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan immigrant, and two other men hit an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

DETENTION DEATHS RISE

At least six people have died in ICE detention centers since the start of 2026, following at least 30 deaths in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high.

The death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos has received the most scrutiny after federal authorities provided shifting accounts of what happened.

ICE initially said Lunas died on January 3 at a Trump-era detention camp on the grounds of a U.S. military base in Texas after experiencing ""medical distress.""

The medical examiner released a report this week that found the death was a homicide due to ""asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,"" the Post reported.

On January 14, two other immigrant detainees died: a Nicaraguan man found unresponsive in the military base site, called East Camp Montana, and a Mexican man found unresponsive in a Georgia detention center, according to ICE.

Both deaths remain under investigation, but ICE said the Nicaraguan man, Victor Manuel Diaz, was presumed to have committed suicide.

The other deaths occurred in Houston, Philadelphia, and Indio, California, ICE said.

Trump increased immigration detention to record levels, with 69,000 held as of early January, according to ICE statistics. Some 43% of the detainees picked up by ICE had no criminal charge or conviction, the figures showed.

In a statement to NewsNation, the agency said Border Patrol officers were conducting a targeted operation in the city when the man approached them with a gun. The officers tried unsuccessfully to take the gun away, but the man resisted, officials said.

“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” DHS wrote.

Medics on scene rendered aid to the man, but DHS said he later died at the scene.

DHS said they also found two magazines on the man following the shooting, alleging that he likely wanted to “do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

Tensions in the area following the shooting have grown drastically since news came out that the person died. Protesters began throwing water bottles and other objects at agents, who then responded by deploying tear gas and pepper spray.

The Trump administration last July issued a ""Detained Parents Directive"" that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE ""should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.""
The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America's divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as ""bait"" by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an ""abject lie."" It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family's attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

School officials say ICE used the boy as 'bait'

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, ""essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,"" she said.

The father told the child's mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn't leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

""Why detain a 5-year-old?"" the superintendent asked. ""You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.""

Other adults at the scene wanted to care for the boy

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

ICE denies what school officials and neighbors said

""ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as 'bait,'"" said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. ""ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ""

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. ""Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.""

The officers, she said, ""abided by the father's wishes to keep the child with him.""

Bovino and ICE officials criticize media coverage

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the ""false media narrative"" about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for ""abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle."" He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and ""did everything they could to reunite him with his family.""

""Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

Where are the father and son now?

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children's Rights, who visited the facility last week.

""The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,"" Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

""Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,"" Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

""I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,"" Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers ""get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.""

The family's lawyer was unable to reach them

The family's lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

""We're looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,"" he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch's office said he was unavailable to comment.

What is the Trump administration's policy on detaining children?

The child's immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn't, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

""This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,"" Homan said last year on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

The Trump administration last July issued a ""Detained Parents Directive"" that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE ""should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them."" The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

""If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child's immigration status,"" said Neha Desai, managing director at Children's Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. ""When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child's care.""

The man was later pronounced dead. This is just the latest incident of deadly violence involving ICE, which has grown increasingly frequent, especially on the streets of Minneapolis. It’s been less than three weeks since an agent murdered Renée Good on January 7th.

Just as in the case of the shooting of Good, video of the killing quickly started circulating online. Though I strongly urge readers to use their judgment before clicking through and pressing play. The video is upsetting and includes the graphic death of a human being.

Governor Tim Walz addressed the public in a conference this afternoon, insisting that the state’s justice system would “have the last word on this.” He harkened back to his earlier calls for citizens to “hit record” when they see ICE. “Minnesotans are witnessing, and we’re creating a log of evidence for the future prosecution of ICE agents and the officials responsible for this,” he said. “Thank god, thank god we have video.”

The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that ICE immediately tried to seize control of the situation by whisking witnesses off to the Whipple building, which has served as a base of operations and detention center during immigration raids in Minneapolis. ICE also attempted to order local police to leave the scene, but Chief Brian O’Hara refused to comply. The official X account of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also confirmed that their access to the crime scene was restricted by DHS agents, despite requests from local police for their assistance in investigating the shooting.

The Star Tribune is updating regularly as information comes in.

But in the hours after fatal shooting, several Democrats have come forward to announce their opposition, including some who had until now appeared ready to vote the funding package.
“The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.
We could beef up training and require identification,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose been pushing his colleagues to block DHS funding for weeks.
What’s unacceptable is the current lawless status quo.” Senate Democrats were expected to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their next steps.","In the wake of another fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minnesota by a federal officer, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said his party would block a funding package next week if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The announcement, which dramatically escalates the potential for another partial government shutdown, comes as anger towards homeland security, which oversees ICE, intensifies among the party after a group of federal agents violently restrained and then fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling – and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer, a New York senator, said in a statement. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no.”

“Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he added.

The Senate is set to take up the spending measure as part of a broader legislative package that would fund broad swaths of the government, including the defense, state , education, labor and transportation departments. That package, which currently calls for $64.4bn for the DHSincluding $10bn for ICE, needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans currently control 53 seats and would need Democratic support to pass the bipartisan package.

The looming vote was seen as a potentially painful decision for many Senate Democrats, wary of setting off another government shutdown just months after a painful 43-day fiscal showdown – the longest in the nation’s history – that ultimately failed to win an extension of healthcare subsidies.

But in the hours after fatal shooting, several Democrats have come forward to announce their opposition, including some who had until now appeared ready to vote the funding package.

“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” Nevada senator Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe. It’s brutalizing US citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Last year, Cortez Masto was one of a handful of Democrats who broke rank and voted repeatedly to keep the government open.

Jacky Rosen, Nevada’s other senator who had also bucked her party during the shutdown, wrote on X: “As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now. That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Mark Warner, a Democratic senator for Virginia, wrote: “I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

In a sign of Democrats’ fury, Washington senator Patty Murray, the ranking member on the appropriations committee, who negotiated funding package, announced she would not support the package as currently written.

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences. I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” she said on X. “The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that. I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

It was unclear if Senate Republicans were willing to separate the DHS funding measure from the rest of the package, which would likely win significant bipartisan support. On Saturday, many Republicans defended the agent and the department in the aftermath of the shooting.

Holding up the homeland security budget would not necessarily curtail the department’s enforcement operations, at least not in the short term. Trump’s 2025 domestic policy bill, known as the “big, beautiful bill”, included a $75bn supplement for ICE the agency could potentially tap if its funding lapsed.

But Democrats say they must use the threat to try to establish guardrails on federal immigration agents, whose increasingly violent tactics have fueled protests in cities across the US.

“We should not fund DHS without serious reform. We could return CBP to border. We could require warrants for immigration arrests. We could beef up training and require identification,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose been pushing his colleagues to block DHS funding for weeks. “The list of possible reforms is long. What’s unacceptable is the current lawless status quo.”

Senate Democrats were expected to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their next steps.

The funding bill narrowly passed the Republican-controlled House on Thursday, overcoming a Democratic revolt following the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Seven Democrats, however, helped nearly all Republicans move it over the line. Explaining their support, several of the Democrats sharply denounced ICE’s conduct in US cities, but argued that the funding bill contained hard-won concessions, including funding for body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE officers.

But Republicans rejected other proposals sought by Democrats, including measures that would have requires judicial warrants for home entries and a provision explicitly prohibiting funds from being used to detain or deport US citizens.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03898e706322e0f29a19b79d2185c78276b747ed/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f376cd0849c7d8b8cbe6d2b0486a8d53",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:14.761169

Protesters expressed their anger and called for local officials to stand with them.The Orlando Police Department was present, ensuring the assembly remained peaceful. Protesters shared their concerns about the escalating tension and violence associated with immigration enforcement, which has made them hesitant to protest, but they emphasized the importance of speaking out when they perceive something as wrong.""They have been in LA, they have been in DC. They have been in Charlotte, they have been in Chicago. This has been the most violent, I would say. And all those people in Minnesota coming out in that cold, cold city. If they can stand out there in the cold, I can stand out in 70/80 degrees,"" said Claire Capps.The protest initially started on all four corners of Bumby and Colonial before the march began. Many protesters participated, and there was significant horn honking, which could affect traffic on Colonial this evening.

The Orlando Police Department was present, ensuring the assembly remained peaceful. Protesters shared their concerns about the escalating tension and violence associated with immigration enforcement, which has made them hesitant to protest, but they emphasized the importance of speaking out when they perceive something as wrong.

""They have been in LA, they have been in DC. They have been in Charlotte, they have been in Chicago. This has been the most violent, I would say. And all those people in Minnesota coming out in that cold, cold city. If they can stand out there in the cold, I can stand out in 70/80 degrees,"" said Claire Capps.

The protest initially started on all four corners of Bumby and Colonial before the march began. Many protesters participated, and there was significant horn honking, which could affect traffic on Colonial this evening.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/596d3f88-9cc3-458f-8d96-ca30069969d2/520fa50e-d8f0-4eec-bb2a-cae86b69e2f8.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:18.810620

“Whoever goes to the United States Senate is going to have to be ready for real war.","Hours after federal immigration agents killed a man in Minneapolis, the top Democrats running for U.S. Senate in Texas appeared on a debate stage together and both called for overhauling Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Just minutes into the debate between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico, which was hosted by the Texas AFL-CIO and moderated by Nexstar’s KXAN-TV and The Dallas Morning News, Crockett referenced the shooting by Department of Homeland Security agents. She pointed to the incident to lay out the stakes of the race ahead of the March 3 primary.

“Listen, we are not looking at politics as usual. Just today, we just had another person gunned down in the streets in Minneapolis,” Crockett said. “And so for anyone that believes that we are going to be able to respond to this in a normal way, I think that they’ve got it wrong.”

Crockett and Talarico also agreed on a range of liberal positions as they fight to flip a Republican-leaning state, including saying that President Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses and that changing the makeup of the Supreme Court should be considered.

Crockett defended her recent vote against a DHS funding bill, saying, “There was no way I was going to continue to pump a historic amount of money into this rogue organization that is going out and is violating people’s rights every single day in American cities.”

“We absolutely have to clean house, whatever that looks like,” Crockett, who supports impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, later said when pressed on whether she would support defunding or abolishing ICE altogether.

Talarico, who also backed impeaching Noem, said it is time to “tear down” the agency.

“ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning,” Talarico said. “It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

Both candidates were also pressed on how they balance their views of ICE when Texas voters may support deporting undocumented immigrants, a nod to the politics of a state that Trump won by 14 points in 2024.

“They are supposed to do Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not going after U.S. citizens, not going after people that are documented. That is not what they are supposed to do, but that is what they are doing,” Crockett said. “They are turning us into Nazi Germany by saying they’re gonna go door to door. They are going after people because of their accent or the color of their skin because this Supreme Court gave them carte blanche ability to do so.”

Talarico pointed to his family’s roots in a Texas border town, calling for balancing border security with an immigration overhaul.

“Our southern border should be like our front porch. There should be a giant welcome mat out front and a lock on the door,” Talarico said. “We can welcome immigrants who want to live the American dream. We can build a pathway to citizenship for those neighbors who have been here, making us richer and stronger, and we can keep out people who mean to do us harm.”

Both candidates referred to immigration enforcement and the clashes in Minnesota, where protests have continued after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis earlier this month, in stark terms later in the debate.

Crockett accused Trump of “seemingly trying to plunge us not only into a civil war with ICE, but he’s also trying to plunge us into World War III,” referring to his foreign policy.

Talarico referred back to ongoing clashes in Minnesota during a discussion about potential military action in Iran, saying, “We can have discussions about how to respond in Iran, where we have seen so many innocent civilians, protesters murdered on their streets. We’re also seeing that in Minnesota as we speak.”

Both candidates sharply criticized the Trump administration as they compete to take on Republican Sen. John Cornyn in the traditionally red state, though Talarico suggested multiple times that state Attorney General Ken Paxton could be the GOP nominee. Cornyn, who is seeking a fifth term, is facing a tough primary fight against Paxton or Rep. Wesley Hunt.

Crockett reiterated her support for impeaching Trump, saying, “There is more than enough to impeach Donald Trump. Period.” She pointed to his tariff policy as one potential impeachable offense.

Talarico also said that “the administration has certainly committed impeachable offenses, particularly when it comes to using their public roles to enrich themselves,” but added that he would carefully examine all of the evidence and “vote my conscience,” as the Senate acts as the jury in an impeachment trial.

The debate revealed few policy differences between the candidates, but a handful of dividing lines emerged on their political strategy and their stances on issues like the Senate filibuster, corporate donations and Supreme Court reforms.

Crockett argued she is the more electable candidate in November, touting support among working-class, Black and female voters and suggesting she will more forcefully take on Trump.

“This is about whether or not we have the will,” Crockett said. “And right now, people are not happy with the Democratic Party. I’ve seen the polling. What they want is someone who is going to be unafraid in the face of what we are facing right now, which is someone who believes he’s a king.”

She took a rare swipe at Talarico, saying he is not as well known in the state despite his time in elected office.

“He’s not as known right now because I have engaged in these fights, and they have been right there on the front lines where people could see me out front,” Crockett said.

Talarico framed his campaign as a fight against billionaires, saying “the real fight in this country is not left versus right, it’s top versus bottom.”

“We have traveled to every corner of Texas because we’re not writing off any voter or any community, and we have shattered grassroots fundraising records without taking a dime of corporate PAC money,” Talarico later added.

Talarico called for banning corporate PACs and super PACs, and he defended past campaign donations to his state legislative campaign committee from a pro-gambling PAC funded by GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson. Talarico said he has never met Adelson and they are not aligned on most issues, but the donation was tied to his support for legalizing gambling in Texas.

Crockett also defended donations to her campaigns from a slew of corporate PACs, saying those donations are limited under federal law and that they come from employee contributions to the PACs. She also said she has used her own campaign funds to boost other Democratic candidates.

The candidates also appeared to take different stances on the 60-vote threshold to end debate in the Senate, known as the filibuster. Talarico has previously said he supports eliminating the filibuster, while Crockett suggested carveouts for certain issues like voting rights could be more feasible.

“There are not a lot of people on the Senate side that are going to say, ‘Hey, yes, let’s do it,’” Crockett said of eliminating the filibuster. “But I do think that we can get somewhere if we focus on looking at, historically, the fact that they have had these carveouts. And we need to make it for, at a very minimum, our fundamental issues.”

Crockett also voiced her support for expanding the Supreme Court, while Talarico said he would be “open” to the move. Talarico added that term limits for justices “can do just as much good” to reduce partisanship on the high court.

As they laid out their stances on a range of other issues including lowering costs, supporting unions and navigating artificial intelligence, Crockett and Talarico both talked about the high stakes of the U.S. Senate race in Texas.

“I have seen the consequences in the trenches of the Texas Legislature of losing elections. I’ve seen my constituents get hurt. I’ve seen rights that we took for granted rolled back. I’ve seen schools close. I’ve seen people not be able to access basic health care. So we have to win in November,” Talarico said.

Crockett said she has “been fighting on the front lines in this corrupt administration,” and she has faced death threats in the process.

“Whoever goes to the United States Senate is going to have to be ready for real war. This is how bad it is,” Crockett said, later adding: “I am here to tell you that it is life or death, as we see what is happening in Minnesota and otherwise.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260123-crockett-talarico-debate-bf-1111-ba257b.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:23.050737

The man was later revealed to be an employee of the Veterans Affairs Department, working as an intensive care unit nurse at the medical center in the city where he was killed.

Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was taken to the ground by several federal agents before one of them shot him. Pretti gathered with other protestors as Border Patrol was conducting what it called a targeted operation to detain an individual it said was in the country illegally.

Trump administration officials accused Pretti of approaching Border Patrol agents with a weapon and resisting efforts to disarm him. They said, without evidence, that Pretti was looking to “massacre law enforcement.” Analysis of videos of the incident by media organizations such as The New York Times found the evidence contradicted that version of events, as Pretti approached the with only his phone and his firearm was holstered and concealed until after the agents had forcefully brought him to the ground.

As a VA nurse, Pretti was a member of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. AFGE President Everett Kelley said Pretti ""dedicated his life to serving American veterans.""

“Our union is heartbroken,” Kelley said. “An AFGE member is dead. And a family’s life has been forever changed.”

Kelley blamed President Trump’s policies for creating the environment in which Pretti’s death occurred, though he encouraged his members to demonstrate restraint.

“I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry,” Kelley said. “Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm.”

The Trump administration was quick to denounce Pretti despite his work for the administration and with veterans, with Homeland Security Department Secretary Kristi Noem quickly labeling him a domestic terrorist. VA did not respond to a request for comment. Records indicate Pretti worked for VA since at least 2016.

Pretti’s death marked the third shooting by federal law enforcement in Minnesota in recent weeks. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good, who was protesting the agency’s enforcement activities from her vehicle. Officers shot another man who was fleeing his attempted arrest.

Doug Massey, president of the AFGE chapter that represents employees in VA's headquarters, said the pain of Pretti's death would be widespread.

“Alex…was known by colleagues, friends, and family as a compassionate caregiver who was deeply committed to helping others,” Massey said. “His senseless death is a profound loss to his loved ones, his patients, and our union family.”

The shooting could have further implications for federal employees: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in response to the shooting that his party would not agree to a six-bill funding package next week if it contains DHS appropriations. Half of the 12-annual must pass spending bills for fiscal 2026 have already cleared Congress, but the remaining six are still pending before the Senate. The House already approved them.

In addition to DHS, those measures would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies. They are currently operating under a stopgap continuing resolution that is set to expire Jan. 30. Lawmakers could opt to fund just those agencies and negotiate separately over DHS, though such an approach would require new votes in both the House and Senate.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/24/012426_Getty_GovExec_MinneapolisShooting/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 01:57:13.968069

But through public land orders, an administration can effectively close off these lands to otherwise lawful activities — most often mineral development — without meaningful accountability.
It is a vivid example of how executive power over public lands has grown far beyond what the Constitution ever intended.
Despite their name, public land orders are rules, given their sweeping impact on the public and the economy.
It would not only overturn Biden’s public land order, but it would also permanently bar any future administration from issuing a substantially similar order.","For decades, the executive branch has unilaterally withdrawn vast tracts of federal land from productive use through a mechanism known as a public land order. For instance, the Biden administration in 2023 signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdrew more than 225,000 acres of land in northern Minnesota from mineral development.

According to experts, this area contains “world-class deposits” and one of the largest undeveloped copper-nickel and platinum-group metal resources in the world — potentially including vast quantities of copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals.

By locking up these lands, the Biden administration effectively killed a planned development that could have helped meet growing global demand for minerals used in everything from household appliances to military aircraft. This decision was made despite opposition from members of Congress, mineral developers and local residents who recognized the economic opportunity that responsible development could bring to the region.

The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres of land — about 28 percent of the United States. These lands contain many of the natural resources essential to our modern economy. Traditionally, federal lands are presumed to be open to multiple uses, including responsible resource development.

But through public land orders, an administration can effectively close off these lands to otherwise lawful activities — most often mineral development — without meaningful accountability. With a single signature, the Department of the Interior can — as in the Minnesota case — lock away a mineral-rich area of land five times the size of Washington, D.C. There was no debate, no vote and no accountability.

That decision, which was buried in bureaucratic procedure, wiped out jobs, investment and access to critical minerals the nation desperately needs. It is a vivid example of how executive power over public lands has grown far beyond what the Constitution ever intended.

Congress, however, is not powerless in the face of such executive action. The Congressional Review Act provides lawmakers with a powerful tool to rein in agency overreach by allowing Congress to nullify federal rules. Despite their name, public land orders are rules, given their sweeping impact on the public and the economy.

Historically, the Congressional Review Act has been woefully underutilized, with less than 1 percent of finalized agency rules ever targeted for repeal. That is beginning to change. During the 119th Congress, lawmakers have already used it to rescind 22 rules, reducing regulatory burdens on Americans by more than $130 billion. Congress has eliminated regulatory burdens that were previously thought to be off-limits from the law’s reach, including the repeal of California’s EPA electric vehicle waiver and several Biden-era resource management plans.

Now it is time to apply the CRA to misguided, job-killing public land orders.

This month, Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) introduced a CRA resolution to nullify Biden’s pubilc land order in Minnesota. The House has passed that resolution, marking a decisive step toward lifting the Biden-era mining ban in northern Minnesota. In the previous Congress, the House passed a bill to revoke this order, but this resolution offers an even stronger solution. It would not only overturn Biden’s public land order, but it would also permanently bar any future administration from issuing a substantially similar order. And unlike most legislation, Congressional Review Act resolutions are not subject to a Senate filibuster.

Repealing the Biden-era land order would be a major victory for American consumers, domestic manufacturers and industries that rely on critical minerals. It would also reaffirm the Constitution’s separation of powers by restoring Congress’s role in major land-use decisions.

More broadly, passage of this CRA resolution should establish a critical precedent: that public land orders are rules subject to the CRA. That precedent would empower Congress to reexamine other harmful PLOs, including one that withdrew over 20,000 acres in South Dakota, known to have deposits of gold and other minerals.

Major policy decisions belong in Congress, not behind closed doors in the executive branch. The Congressional Review Act gives lawmakers a brief 60-day window to act. Now that the House has acted, the Senate must seize this opportunity and quickly approve the resolution and send it to the president’s desk. Passing the resolution offers a clear opportunity to restore economic opportunity, domestic production and the constitutional balance of power.

Several of those spending measures passed the House with strong bipartisan support while the bill funding Homeland Security passed more narrowly by a margin of 220 to 207.","The risk of a partial government shutdown at the end of January grew more likely Saturday after Senate Democrats vowed to block a funding package over a fatal Minneapolis shooting involving federal law enforcement authorities.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Saturday evening said that Democrats will block a major government funding package if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), calling the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis “appalling.”

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said in a statement.

“Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he warned.

Schumer blasted Senate and House Republicans for failing to include language in the Homeland Security spending bill to put constraints on ICE officers, who have been accused of using excessive force against protesters in Minneapolis.

He issued his remarks after law enforcement officials identified Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse and Minneapolis resident, as the man who was shot and killed by federal agents during an ICE operation Saturday morning.

“Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,” Schumer said.

Schumer’s statement came after liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is viewed as a potential primary challenger to Schumer in 2028, called on Senate Democrats to block ICE funding.

“Americans are being killed in the street by their government. Our Constitution is being shredded and our rights are dissolving. Resist. Senate Democrats should block ICE funding this week. Activate the National Guard. We can and must stop this,” she said.

She spoke out against ICE funding after Pretti’s fatal shooting by a Border Patrol Agent.

Senate Democrats are now scheduled to hold a caucus-wide conference call at 6 p.m. on Sunday to discuss their strategy for how to handle the government funding bills that need to pass by Jan. 30 to avoid a partial government shutdown.

Schumer’s new statement marks a significant shift in sentiment among senior Senate Democrats, who signaled last week that a six-bill appropriations package passed by the House would likely to pass the upper chamber by the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the most senior member of the Senate Democratic caucus, said in a statement last week that blocking funding for DHS would have little impact on ICE operations.

“ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a CR nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,” Murray said, referring to tens of billions of dollars allocated to ICE in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law last year.

Murray argued that the “suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.”

The House last week passed a rule to combine six different appropriations bills funding more than two-thirds of the federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Education and Health and Human Services, into one package that was set to be fast-tracked on the Senate floor.

Several of those spending measures passed the House with strong bipartisan support while the bill funding Homeland Security passed more narrowly by a margin of 220 to 207. Only seven House Democrats voted for that measure, which also fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Since, then a growing number of Senate Democrats have said they would vote against a government funding package that includes money for Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has become a target of Democratic outrage over images of violent confrontations between ICE officers and protesters.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is up for re-election in November, wrote Saturday on the social platform X.

“This brutal crackdown has to end,” he added. “I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) accused Noem of turning ICE “into an aggressive paramilitary force that terrorizes our communities, interferes with local policing and makes our communities less safe.”

“She has abused her authority — I will not support a funding bill that gives her a blank check to fund ICE’s inhumane tactics and excessive force,” he said in a Friday statement.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Friday called for Democrats to “insist” on adding language to the Homeland Security bill to require ICE officers to obtain arrest warrants before entering a target’s home and implement other reforms.

“I think there is an opportunity. Certainly, there’s an obligation to try to insist on conditions attached to these appropriations bills,” he said in an interview with MS NOW’s “Morning Joe.”

“I’m a ‘no’ vote on that spending bill unless there are conditions that require ICE to go to a judge to get a warrant as well as other constraints,” he said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/schumerchuck_010626gn12_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-25 01:57:18.479164

But a number of Senate Democrats said on Saturday that those measures fell far short of what was necessary in the current moment.","Bipartisan legislation to fund a broad swath of the government and avert a shutdown at the end of the week appeared to be in grave danger on Saturday, as key Senate Democrats vowed to oppose it after federal agents shot and killed a Minneapolis resident.

The rapidly escalating opposition to the measure, which includes $64.4 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including $10 billion for ICE, amplified the likelihood of a partial government shutdown at the end of the month. The legislation requires the support of Democrats to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster and advance in the Senate.

“Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the D.H.S. funding bill is included,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in a statement, calling what is unfolding in Minnesota “appalling” and “unacceptable in any American city.”

Recognizing the depth of Democratic outrage, Senate Republicans immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government. The measure also funds the Pentagon and State Department, as well as health, education, labor and transportation programs.

“I’m exploring all options,” said Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, adding that she had been in touch with Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader. “We have five other bills that are really vital, and I’m relatively confident they would pass.”

A planned vote on the package next week had already promised to pose an agonizing dilemma for many Democrats. They have been eager to avoid another shutdown but have grown increasingly infuriated by the scenes of chaos and violence coming out of Minnesota and facing intense pressure not to fund ICE. Some had already announced they would not support the package as a result, but a substantial bloc had been expected to swallow their reservations and back it.

But hours after the killing on Saturday, a flood of Democrats who had previously been seen as likely to support the deal declared that they simply could not do so.

“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement announcing her opposition. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe. It’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote on social media: “I cannot and will not vote to fund D.H.S. while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

The spending measure that senators are set to take up includes six bills to fund the government that Democrats and Republicans negotiated, and that the House already passed.

The House considered the homeland security portion separately, given the depth of Democratic opposition, and all but seven House Democrats voted against it.

The measure rejects President Trump’s request for an $840 million increase in funding for ICE, instead leaving it roughly the same as the previous year, when the agency was operating off funds provided in a stopgap measure.

While other departments and agencies would most likely shutter if Senate Democrats filibuster the spending package, ICE could potentially tap the $75 billion Republicans allocated to it in their marquee domestic policy bill. That legislation largely contained tax cuts and spending reductions for programs including Medicaid and food assistance, but also included $190 billion for the Department of Homeland Security.

During negotiations on the homeland security bill, Republicans rejected a series of proposals by Democrats to rein in ICE, including barring funds from being used to to detain or deport U.S. citizens. Democrats succeeded in winning the addition of $20 million for purchasing body cameras for ICE agents.

They also won the inclusion of a provision to reduce funding for Ms. Noem’s office by $29.5 million and require the secretary to pay for any travel on government aircraft — in this case private jets the Coast Guard bought — out of the budget for her own office.

Ms. Collins, who called for an investigation into the shooting, noted that the spending measure also include some new guardrails on ICE, included money for de-escalation training and added authority for the agency’s inspector general to investigate disputed accounts of ICE activities. Those provisions would be lost if Congress ended up not approving the new bill, she said.

But a number of Senate Democrats said on Saturday that those measures fell far short of what was necessary in the current moment.

“I am voting against funding for D.H.S. until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a member of the Appropriations Committee. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory and making all of us less safe.”

Mr. Schumer also said he would vote no.

“Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the D.H.S. bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/24minneapolis-ice-congress/13TRUMP-NEWS-WARNER-print-lpkc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 21:57:30.436059

Outrage is growing in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, after ICE agents detained a 5-year-old boy named Liam Ramos and his father, who is an asylum seeker. Photos from the scene show a masked agent standing next to Liam, who was wearing his backpack and a blue winter hat with bunny ears. He had just returned from preschool. The father and son were then quickly sent to a detention facility in Texas.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis and defended ICE for targeting the boy’s father and detaining the preschooler.

Vice President JD Vance: “So, the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old. Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death?”

Local officials in Columbia Heights condemned the detention of 5-year-old Liam Ramos. Rachel James serves on the Columbia Heights City Council. She described efforts by neighbors to protect the boy.

Rachel James: “I heard one neighbor say, 'I live in this house. I'm part of this family. I can take him. Let him come to me.’ I heard another neighbor on the other side say, 'I have the forms. His mom signed the forms. Let me have him. I know him. I know him. … I kept saying, “Stop. Wait. He can go with us. He can go with the teachers.”' And then they took him over to the car, and he was just standing there. And then they quickly put him in the back seat and drove away.”

On Thursday, the lawyer for the Ramos family, Marc Prokosch, said Liam and his father had come to the U.S. in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum.

Marc Prokosch: “Liam and his dad did enter the United States at a port of entry to seek asylum through the CBP One app at the Brownsville border crossing. So they did everything right when they came in. They used the app. They made an appointment. They came to the border and presented themselves to Customs and Border Patrol. They’ve shared all of their information with the government, and they were following the process. They were just trying to secure safety and persecution for their family from their home country. But ICE didn’t care about the fact that they had those pending claims, and then just arrested them.”

In news from Gaza, Israeli tank shelling killed four Palestinians on Thursday. The killings came as President Trump was launching his so-called Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland. At the ceremony, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner outlined his vision for turning Gaza into a glitzy seaside resort filled with futuristic high-rise buildings.

Jared Kushner: “In the Middle East, they build cities like this in — you know, 2-3 million people, they build this in three years. And so, stuff like this is very doable, if we make it happen.”

Kushner said the first phase of the project would be rebuilding the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which was leveled by Israel. The Rafah border crossing with Egypt is expected to reopen next week.

Many Palestinians fear Israel and the U.S. will move to forcibly displace them from Gaza. On Thursday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog met in Davos with the leader of Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region. Israel recently became the first nation to recognize Somaliland as an independent nation. There have been reports Israel wants to expel Palestinians en masse from Gaza to Somaliland.

This all comes as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive with little food or shelter. This is Mohammed Al-Qudra in Khan Younis speaking about Trump’s plan for Gaza.

Mohammed Al-Qudra: “No matter how much he says, it’s all in vain. Why? Because we, as citizens, aren’t seeing any real change on the ground. The suffering remains the same. Rain. There are no tents, no shelters, as you can see, the destruction. Wood, we don’t have that. … President Trump announced that the second phase had begun, but we haven’t seen anything. People in al-Mawasi are living in tents, displaced. People in the east can’t reach their homes. You can hear the shooting, the shelling, day and night, martyrs.”

The Wall Street Journal is reporting the Trump administration has been plotting ways to topple the Cuban government in the wake of the U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The Journal reports the U.S. is “searching for Cuban government insiders who can help cut a deal” to push out the current leadership.

On Thursday, The Guardian reported the U.S. used a similar model in Venezuela.

Cloud ICE clash.","ST. CLOUD. Minn. — At least 350 people gathered for about two hours from roughly 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, outside the Great River Regional Library in St. Cloud to protest against reportedly violent tactics being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Protesters gathered as a man was reportedly fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Saturday, according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. DHS authorities say the man who was shot was armed.

On Jan. 7, Renee Good, 37, was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. One week later, on Jan. 14 another man was shot in the leg by a federal agent, after three men reportedly used a broom handle and shovels on the agent.

Americans for Democracy, a St. Cloud-area grassroots group, helped organize Saturday's protest, according to founder Jill Kelly, who referenced the morning's shooting in an interview with the St. Cloud Times.

""People are enraged over what happened, (both with) this morning and what's been happening,"" Kelly said. ""It is unbelievable that it's happening in our state, and they're attacking us more so than any other state.""

While St. Cloud is a little more than an hour-drive north of the Twin Cities, where on Jan. 22, Vice President JD Vance said immigration enforcement is focused, Kelly said, immigration efforts impact the entire state. On Jan. 12 there was a clash between ICE agents and civilians that reportedly percipitated agents to use a chemical irritant on civilians. The crowd threw snowballs at agents during the St. Cloud confrontation.

""I think we've been seeing that (ICE presence) throughout the whole state,"" Kelly said. ""Pop-up protests are happening. People aren't gonna put up with this.""

Immigration enforcement also trickles down into local politics. Two St. Cloud City Council members introduced resolutions after the Jan. 12 St. Cloud ICE clash. Councilmember Hudda Ibrahim introduced a resolution to reaffirm the city's objective to be a welcoming place for all. Meanwhile, Councilmember Scott Brodeen proposed a resolution to support all law enforcement officers, including ICE, and the rule of law.

Those resolutions are slated for discussion at the council's Jan. 26 meeting.

Coleen Fitzgerald, dressed as a clown, drove to the St. Cloud protest from Milaca. She said her outfit resembles federal officials who she believes act foolishly. She held pictures of President Donald Trump, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Vance. The pictures were decorated by Fitzgerald to make the officials look like clowns.

""They were clowns before they got put in those offices, and they'll be clowns when they leave,"" Fitzgerald said. ""They're not people that are respected.""

While both Kelly and Fitzgerald oppose violent tactics used by ICE, they said, they support the deportation of criminals. However, both said, the tactics and methods of those deportations needs to be civil and humane.

""There's got to be some immigration enforcement, but it doesn't have to be done with the vitriol and the violence that they're doing now,"" Fitzgerald said.

Kelly had a similar sentiment, saying she wants to make sure due process is provided.

""I think most of us would agree that illegal immigrants that have committed serious crimes should not be in this country,"" she said. ""But there is a way to go about things. First of all, due process. That is our right.""

The legislation needs 60 votes to secure passage in the chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats. And a number of key Democrats who have voted for recent appropriations measures said they’ll vote against funding the Department of Homeland Security unless restrictions are put on how immigration officers carry out enforcement operations.

Follow live updates out of Minneapolis here.

The package, which has passed the House, is slated to come up for a Senate vote this week.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Saturday. “Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who broke with her party and opposed its recent shutdown standoff over the Affordable Care Act, said she won’t support the DHS measure.

“The Trump Administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability. They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants. I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who, like Rosen, was one of the eight Senate Democrats who voted to reopen the government in November, also came out against the DHS legislation.

“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen said in a statement. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., another one of the eight Democrats who voted for the November bill, came out against the current package one day before the Minnesota shooting. He said Congress shouldn’t validate a president who is “acting chaotically and unlawfully” and that he wants “significant amendment” to it.

Numerous Republican senators defended DHS after the killing of the man, identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse serving veterans.

But the department’s actions also sparked heavy criticism from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, who negotiated funding package.

“This looks like an execution. There must be an investigation. There must be accountability,” Murray said on X. “Joining ICE does not give you license to murder. The President is escalating the situation—and I have no faith he will stop. The Republican Congress must join us to end this. Enough.”

The legislation funds ICE at current levels, but without the guardrails and restraints that Democrats had demanded on how immigration officers may carry out enforcement.

“I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a statement. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe.”

The non-DHS funding measures are less controversial and include various provisions that Democrats count as victories, including money for child care, mental health, housing assistance and Pell Grants. Some Democrats, including Cortez Masto, are calling for DHS money to be decoupled and voted on separately.

But there’s no indication that GOP leaders will do that. A spokesperson for Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said they will come up as one bill.

Another complication for Democrats is that Republicans passed a one-time infusion of $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including ICE, which would be legally available for the Trump administration to spend even if DHS funding lapses.

Republicans will need at least seven Democrats — probably eight, if Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., continues his streak of voting against appropriations bills — to pass any measure.

Additional Democrats who said they’ll oppose the DHS funding bill include Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Mark Warner of Virginia.

Temporary funding for those departments, representing more than 75 percent of federal discretionary spending, expires midnight Friday.

Senate Democrats will hold a conference call Sunday evening, according to a Democratic aide granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. The call will give them a chance to discuss next steps with the Senate stuck out of town until at least Tuesday because of the massive winter storm affecting much of the country.

Earlier in the day, as news of the Minneapolis shooting spread, several Democratic senators who had previously voted to advance government funding measures under President Donald Trump vowed to oppose DHS funding this time. Funding for ICE and Border Patrol, the agencies involved in the Minnesota operation, is included in the pending Senate bill.

“I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) in a statement Saturday. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe.”

Schatz helped advance a funding bill in March, and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who voted to end the 43-day shutdown in November, also both said Saturday that they will oppose the DHS funding bill.

“I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen said on X. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

The DHS bill passed the House Thursday 220-207, with only seven Democrats voting for it. But Republican House leaders merged it with five other bills funding the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and State, among others, sending it to the Senate as one package.

More than half of the 47-member Democratic caucus has already vowed to oppose the package, many before Saturday’s shooting. And that number is growing as Democrats’ re-evaluate the legislation in the wake of the shooting and as they face pressure from House Democrats and their Senate colleagues, not to mention outside voices close to the party base.

Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate seeking a Senate seat in Michigan, said in an interview Saturday he saw no way for any Democrat to justify a vote for DHS funding.

“How many more people do they need to shoot?” he asked.

A group of senators, including Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), have been whipping colleagues for days to oppose the DHS bill, according to two aides granted anonymity to discuss their private effort. And two people familiar with the plans said House Democrats are scheduled to hold a private caucus call Sunday morning to discuss a response to the shooting.

Cortez Masto, in a statement, suggested dropping the Department of Homeland Security bill from the larger package, noting there is a “bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget.”

“Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe,” she said.

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said he would agree to “immediately pass” the other five bills while providing “short term funding for DHS so the Senate can fully debate and vote on common sense reforms to ICE that bolster the rule of law.”

But stripping out the DHS bill before the Friday deadline would require every senator to agree — something Republicans aren’t likely to be able to get. Any changes to the package, meanwhile, will require sending it back to the House, which has already left town until after the shutdown deadline.

Instead, Republicans believe it’s up to Democrats to decide whether or not to vote against the funding package and avoid a partial shutdown. GOP leaders aren’t currently expected to bring the House back early from its break, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy.

Democratic aides, meanwhile, privately acknowledged Saturday that the odds of a shutdown were rising, though some questioned what alternatives are available if Democrats block the pending six-bill package.

Heading into the weekend, some Democrats acknowledged they were conflicted — including Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a senior appropriator who has championed Congress’ ability to use the spending bills to reverse many of Trump’s foreign aid cuts.

“I don’t know the details of exactly what the language is in the Homeland Security bills in terms of trying to hold ICE accountable and trying to minimize their misconduct, and I don’t know whether it is worse to have a continuing resolution and how that might be misused,” Coons told reporters Friday.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F47%2F26%2F1beb046d49468116fc0a3e55f93f%2Fu-s-congress-30162.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 20:57:41.714199

US President Donald Trump on Saturday urged Minnesota officials to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate freely, warning that the state would face more severe consequences if it is not cleared of undocumented immigrants.

“Let our ICE patriots do their job! 12,000 illegal alien criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. He warned that those still in the state would create “something far worse than you are witnessing today.”

Trump’s comments came hours after a US Border Patrol officer shot and killed an armed individual wanted for “violent assault” during a targeted operation in Minneapolis.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara identified the man as a 37-year-old white American citizen with only traffic violations on record. Authorities said he was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.

Trump said federal agents were deployed to Minnesota because of what he described as “massive monetary fraud, with billions of dollars missing” under Democratic border policies.

He questioned why local police failed to protect federal officers and accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of “inciting insurrection” through their public statements. Trump described the unfolding events as a “cover-up” for what he alleged were stolen public funds.

Vance, Bondi blame Minnesota officials

US Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi also placed blame on Minnesota’s leadership for the fatal shooting, saying state and city officials refused to cooperate with federal authorities.

“When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand,” Vance said. He added that Minneapolis leadership “has so far refused to answer those requests.”

Bondi told Fox News that the Justice Department sent Gov. Walz “a very strong letter” demanding that he “better support President Trump.”

She claimed the shooting occurred because Minneapolis officials had declared the city a sanctuary jurisdiction, alleging that undocumented immigrants were drawn there for protection.

Tensions have escalated in Minnesota amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, following allegations of large-scale fraud linked to publicly subsidized day care centers. State and local officials have denied the claims.

The situation further deteriorated after the ICE-related operation resulted in the fatal shooting of an American citizen.

Earlier this week, Trump defended aggressive enforcement tactics by immigration agents, acknowledging that officers can be excessively forceful but arguing such measures are justified due to the risks involved.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/24/thumbs_b_c_9574a78b93919e5ced9c6ec9f08ab35c.jpg?v=231835,N,,2026-01-24 19:59:05.370668

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) wrote on the social platform X.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) wrote on the social platform X. “This brutal crackdown has to end. I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

On Saturday morning, a Minneapolis resident was shot and killed during an alleged “armed struggle” with Border Patrol agents, just a block from where 37-year-old Renee Good was fatally shot in her SUV by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer Jonathan Ross. In another incident, a Venezuelan migrant was shot in the leg after federal officials claimed he struck an officer with a “shovel or broom stick.”

Days prior, seven House Democrats joined with nearly all Republicans to pass a sweeping $64.4 billion funding bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for ICE. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was the lone GOP congressman to vote against the measure.

It passed over the objections of Democratic leaders, who argued it did not do enough to rein in ICE operations and the conduct of officers.

The measure did contain a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, in an attempt to placate Democrats.

But following Saturday’s shooting in Minneapolis, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stated bluntly she was a “hell no” on the bill.

“I’m a hell no — not a penny more for ICE. We should not fund this terror,” she wrote on X.

The senators’ comments came after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) urged her Democratic colleagues on Saturday to oppose the bill when it comes to the floor for a vote next week.

“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X.

“DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence. They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO,” she continued.

Anger has already been growing over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics in the wake of several shootings involving federal agents in Minnesota this month, which have sparked widespread protests.

Saturday’s incident comes as senators are set to decide next week whether to send a package of funding bills, including the DHS bill, to President Trump’s desk as they race to avert a partial government shutdown.

That effort now seems more fraught amid an impending winter storm that has canceled votes for Monday and signs of opposition from Democrats.

Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) also said Saturday she would not support the measure, arguing it was time to “fight back.”

“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen wrote. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) joined the fray, writing on X that he will vote against funding DHS “until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable.”

“These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe,” he concluded.

A Democratic National Committee (DNC) X account aimed its ire at White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who earlier in the day accused critics of defending a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/warnermark_010626gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-24 21:57:34.437949

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, described the man who was shot Saturday as a “gunman” and suggested a cover-up by Minnesota Democrats.
OF MINNESOTA!” Trump wrote in a separate post.
“If you obstruct a law enforcement officer or assault a law enforcement officer, you are in violation of the law and will be arrested,” he added.
During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face.","“A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wrote on X Saturday, referring to a tweet from the Democratic National Committee about the shooting that stated “Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW.”

Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota focused her anger on ICE, posting on social media: “This appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement. I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community.”

In Saturday morning’s shooting, a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis who claimed he approached federal officers with a 9 mm gun but didn’t specify if he was holding or brandishing the weapon. Various videos of the incident appear to show the man holding a phone.

Minneapolis has emerged as the epicenter of the debate over the Trump administration’s immigration actions and deployment of federal agents. It came to a head after a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, earlier this month in an incident that has sparked weeks of demonstrations in the city and fights between the White House and state officials over who would investigate the shootings.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, described the man who was shot Saturday as a “gunman” and suggested a cover-up by Minnesota Democrats. The Justice Department has subpoenaed several Democratic Minneapolis state officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, who called the DOJ’s subpoena a “partisan distraction.”

“AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IS A ‘COVER UP’ FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE ONCE GREAT STATE (BUT SOON TO BE GREAT AGAIN!) OF MINNESOTA!” Trump wrote in a separate post.

Trump also assailed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, and Walz in the first Saturday post, accusing them of “inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino told reporters at a Saturday press conference that the incident “looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” though he didn’t provide any evidence for his claim.

“If you obstruct a law enforcement officer or assault a law enforcement officer, you are in violation of the law and will be arrested,” he added. “Our law enforcement officers take an oath to protect the public.”

Video of the shooting, posted on social media and verified by The New York Times, shows the 37-year-old man appearing to film agents in Minneapolis on Saturday before they push him and several others back. The videos don’t appear to show the man drawing his weapon, but not all angles are accounted for. During a struggle with the man on the ground, an agent fires several shots, then the group of federal agents back away.

The man, identified by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as Alex Pretti, had a legal permit to carry a firearm, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who spoke during a press conference Saturday.

Bovino told reporters that “an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a border patrol agent fired defensive shots.” But when asked by a reporter when the individual drew his firearm, Bovino said the shooting is still under investigation.

The latest POLITICO Poll illustrates just how sharply views of ICE — and its presence in cities across the country — diverge along partisan lines. A majority of voters who backed Trump in 2024 — 57 percent — say risks to the lives of anti-ICE protestors are a price worth paying to carry out immigration enforcement, compared with just 15 percent of voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris.

By contrast, nearly three-quarters of Harris voters — 71 percent — say it is not worth risking the lives of anti-ICE protesters to conduct immigration enforcement, a view shared by just 31 percent of Trump voters, the poll, conducted from Jan. 16 to 19, found.

The divide extends to perceptions of public safety: 64 percent of Trump voters say ICE agents make U.S. cities safer, while 80 percent of Harris voters say the opposite, that their presence is making them more dangerous.

Democrats also used heated language to describe the shooting. During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning. It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

His opponent, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, also weighed in: “This is the fifth-highest funded military force in the entire world. And what are they doing? They’re killing people in the middle of the street.”

Walz on Saturday urged the federal government to allow Minnesota officials to take control of the probe into the shooting. He told reporters that he said to the White House in an early morning call that “the federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period.”

“As I said last week, this federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Walz said at a press conference Saturday. “It’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed another life. I’ve seen the videos from several angles. And it’s sickening.”

When asked for comment, the White House referred POLITICO to Trump’s Truth Social post and to a post on X from the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed, “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted.”

They did not respond to requests to questions as to what evidence showed the man who was shot was a “terrorist.”

Vice President JD Vance also placed the blame of Saturday’s shooting at Minnesota leaders’ feet, saying their unwillingness to work with immigration enforcement agents was the primary reason for the shooting.

“When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand,” he wrote on X. “The local leadership in Minnesota has so far refused to answer those requests.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F66%2Ff3dd85dc4fdbb7faa2732e801c89%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-53307.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 18:58:14.223975

The National Weather Service’s Winter Storm Severity Index on Saturday afternoon displayed expected “extreme impacts” in northern Mississippi and “major impacts” in Washington, D.C., and surrounding states.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser implemented a state of emergency for the district on Friday, which went into effect on Saturday at noon. Several state governors also issued emergency declarations at the end of the week in preparation for the winter storm.

In her emergency order, Bowser noted an expected snowfall rate of 2-3 inches per hour and low temperatures “expected to have serious widespread effects.”

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced Friday afternoon that federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area will be closed on Monday, with “maximum telework” in effect.

“We hope that everyone stays safe (and warm) over the weekend,” OPM Director Scott Kupor wrote on X.

Up on Capitol Hill, the Senate postponed its first votes until Tuesday due to the storm, narrowing the already-tight deadline to negotiate and pass a minibus funding bill to avert a government shutdown.

The House approved the Republican-backed funding package on Thursday with the support of seven House Democrats.

The funding measure consists of six separate spending bills and needs the support of at least eight Democrats in order to pass in the Senate. Legislators have until Friday to pass the legislation or face the government shutting down.

Snow delays on Capitol Hill are rare but not unprecedented. The “Snowmageddon” blizzard in February of 2010 dumped feet of snow on D.C. and the surrounding states, grinding congressional activity to a halt for multiple days because lawmakers could not physically get to the U.S. Capitol.

Outside of D.C., the White House has also begun preparations for responses from federal agencies to the winter storm’s impact across several states.

President Trump approved emergency declarations for an additional 10 states to receive assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Saturday. The included states are Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana and West Virginia.

The Trump administration had previously approved South Carolina and Virginia’s requests.

“We are working closely with FEMA, Governors, and State Emergency Management teams to ensure the safety of everybody,” Trump, who is expected to remain in the District, posted on Truth Social on Saturday. “Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!”

FEMA said in a Saturday morning report that its National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) has currently categorized conditions at a “Level 3,” the lowest-level disaster response, which requires “a moderate amount of direct federal assistance.”

Additionally, the agency said in the report that the departments of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Transportation are preparing to assist with the federal response.

“What happened in Minneapolis today is unacceptable. Another life has been lost during a reckless federal immigration operation. Two people, both 37 years old, have been killed within weeks of each other in the same city. We are witnessing an unprecedented pattern of excessive and deadly force being used against our own communities.

Instead of tamping down the chaos and state of uncertainty, the Trump administration continues to double down on its excessive and deadly use of force, distortion of facts, and the weaponization of the justice system. When federal agents are deployed into residential neighborhoods with little oversight and sweeping authority, people are put in harm’s way.

The people of Minneapolis have the right to demand ICE out of their neighborhoods, and accountability from the leaders who’ve led us to these conditions. We demand that there be an immediate and independent investigation into what happened today. The Trump administration has failed to protect another human life, and we urge Congress to impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem immediately.”

Judges decline to order lower court to approve charges

Defendants allege retaliation amid Trump's immigration crackdown

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.

The ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.

A federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants for five proposed defendants, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.

DEFENDANTS ACCUSE ADMINISTRATION OF RETALIATION

The case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed to protect Christian services.

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.

The Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing a risk of similar church disruptions.

The chief U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request as ""unheard of in our district"" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.

All three judges on the 8th Circuit panel agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.

The Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.

Rights watchdog warns International Protection Bill ‘still riddled with gaps’

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has delivered a sharp critique of the International Protection Bill 2026, published earlier this month. In a submission released last night, the Commission says the draft law ""lacks clarity on access to legal advice, vulnerability assessments and safeguards for victims of trafficking.""

IHREC welcomes the Government’s aim of cutting average asylum decision times to six months but argues that speed cannot trump fairness: mandatory interviews conducted in ‘integrated reception centres’ will, it fears, pressure applicants who have not yet secured legal representation. The body also questions proposed restrictions on applicants’ freedom of movement, warning that any de-facto detention must meet strict proportionality tests under EU law.

For applicants and employers trying to keep pace with these evolving rules, VisaHQ offers real-time guidance on Irish visa categories, document requirements and processing times; its specialists monitor legislative changes like the International Protection Bill and can assist with related travel or residency filings. More information is available at https://www.visahq.com/ireland/.

For employers, the Bill’s promise of faster decisions could ease uncertainty when recruiting asylum-seekers who later become eligible for work permits. Yet NGOs caution that rushed procedures risk higher appeal rates, prolonging cases and clogging courts.

Justice officials insist the text transposes the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum and that “all applicants will continue to receive free legal aid.” The Bill is expected to reach second stage in the Dáil next month; mobility teams should monitor amendments closely, as final provisions will determine time-lines for labour-market access and potential reporting obligations for sponsors of protection applicants.

International law is unequivocal on this point.”","It’s a dubious distinction for a country long rooted in democracy.

As the world marks the Day of the Endangered Lawyer today, the coalition behind the observance has designated the United States as the focus country for 2026.

Every year, the International Coalition for the Day of the Endangered Lawyer, made up of legal associations, bar associations, and networks of legal defenders, selects a country to concentrate attention on the specific challenges lawyers there face and build awareness of the serious risks they’re confronting simply for doing their job.

In its annual report, released Thursday, the Coalition said this year’s selection is “grounded in serious concern over the documented and escalating pattern of interference with the independence of lawyers, law firms, bar associations, prosecutors, and judges in the United States.”

These developments raise profound questions regarding compliance with international legal standards governing the role and protection of lawyers, as well as the functioning of the justice system, it noted.

The United States now joins the ranks of dictatorships and autocracies like Belarus, China, Iran and Afghanistan, which have been countries of focus in the past.

“Let that sink in,” Nancy Hollander, an internationally recognized US criminal defence lawyer, said in November at the International Bar Association conference in Toronto. She was part of a panel discussing the assault on independent lawyering around the world.

“We’re in a terrible situation. We have an authoritarian fascist dictatorship. There’s no getting around it. No one can say that’s not where we are.”

‘A climate of fear’

Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, it has targeted lawyers and firms it perceives to be opposed to its agenda based on their current or past legal representation, or pro bono work.

This has involved executive orders naming firms and exerting pressure on them through “compliance arrangements,” raising concerns about coerced alignment and the erosion of professional independence.

There have also been threats to revoke security clearances and cancel federal contracts, as well as questioning and harassment of lawyers at border crossings and attacks on bar associations. Further, there’s been a chilling effect on legal representation in sensitive areas such as immigration, civil liberties and LGBTI+ rights.

Judicial independence is under attack amid a barrage of politicized criticism of judges, including threats of removal, calls for impeachment, and efforts to delegitimize unfavourable rulings. On top of the creeping executive interference, politicized criticism has led to increased threats of physical violence against judges and their families.

“Taken together, these measures do not constitute isolated incidents. They form a pattern that creates a climate of fear, uncertainty, and anticipatory self-censorship within the legal profession, discouraging lawyers from taking on cases, clients, or arguments that may attract political or administrative retaliation,” the Coalition said in its report.

Members were alarmed by the “sustained and co-ordinated campaign aimed at undermining the independence of the legal profession and the judiciary.”

The Coalition noted that this year’s focus on the United States does not suggest that attacks on lawyers are new or unique there. However, there is a “troubling pattern of political intimidation and institutional destabilization unprecedented in the modern history of the US.” The Coalition said this escalation in pressure demands collective international attention.

It also underscores the fact that no matter how entrenched the rule of law may be, no jurisdiction is immune to backsliding.

The work of Margaret Satterthwaite, the UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, influenced the Coalition’s decision to focus on the United States. An independent monitor of how legal professionals are treated around the world, she’s raised concerns about what’s been happening south of the border.

“What happened after the second Trump presidency began was that I started to see some emblematic signs of what I would call autocratization,” she told the CBA’s Verdicts & Voices podcast in November.

Hollander, who has represented Chelsea Manning and several Guantanamo Bay detainees, said the Trump administration has turned the Department of Justice into the Department of Retaliation.

That’s seen scores of government lawyers fired for being a part of prosecutions against Trump over the January 6 attack on the Capitol and other alleged crimes.

“They’re taking the brunt of this,” she said.

“It’s (now) his personal law firm.”

Among those targeted in what’s been described as a “campaign of retribution” are Jack Smith, former special counsel and New York attorney general Letitia James.

“This is only the beginning,” Hollander said, noting many lawyers can no longer even get into public buildings and courtrooms.

“I’ve represented a lot of people who’ve had their clearance taken away.”

What’s unfolding has seen lawyers mobilize south of the border. Hollander pointed to the newly formed Lawyers for the Rule of Law.

“We are a national network of volunteer attorneys committed to defending democracy and the rule of law—especially when those in power fail to do so,” the group says on its website.

In addition to pro bono representation, members are providing amicus advocacy, holding leaders and public officials accountable for unethical and illegal activities, providing public education, and organizing peaceful protests.

Beyond borders

Often, it’s not the government in the country where they practice that a lawyer has to worry about.

Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, an Irish barrister specializing in human rights and civil liberties, told the IBA panel that authoritarian regimes seek to silence critics wherever they are in the world through transnational repression.

Increasingly, the law is used as a systematic tool to shut down the rule of law and freedom of expression through direct, online and remote threats, the cancellation of passports, co-opting other countries to join them, coercion, and physical surveillance.

She’s been followed around the United Nations, and as a result of her representing jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media mogul Jimmy Lai, she’s been targeted by China. This has included surveillance, threats on her life, and threats of rape. The latter extended to her children.

Gallagher said that more lawyers are being killed than journalists in the Philippines for the work they’re doing. And as soon as a lawyer takes on a case against Iran or Saudi Arabia, they’re targeted.

“It’s an anywhere in the world problem,” she said of the length of a state’s arm.

“Nowhere is safe if you’re a lawyer.”

Here in Canada, Irwin Cotler knows this all too well.

The former MP and justice minister has long been an outspoken critic of the regime in Tehran, and started campaigning in 2008 to have the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps listed as a terrorist entity (which didn’t happen until 2024). His work as a human rights advocate and lawyer, representing Iranian dissidents, put him in Iran’s crosshairs.

“I remember the date exactly, November 14, 2023, because I was flying back from Washington. We landed at Trudeau airport in Montreal, and we received notice from the RCMP as soon as we landed: ‘Don't leave, wait for us at the baggage counter.’”

Officers met him, took him to a room and told him they had evidence of an “imminent and lethal threat” on his life.

From then on, he had 24/7 protection — four armoured cars outside his house at all times and armed RCMP officers with him everywhere he went.

Cotler says the threat wasn’t surprising. He’d had issues with Iran for 20 years at that point, and knew from friends there that the regime characterized him as an enemy of the people.

In October 2024, he was informed of a plot to assassinate him within 48 hours. He was supposed to attend the 60th anniversary of his McGill law class that evening, and in the morning, the RCMP told him all seemed okay. Later in the day, they told him he couldn’t go.

“I said I'd really been looking forward to this. And they said, ‘No, we have new information about an imminent threat of assassination on your life within the next 24 to 48 hours. So you can't go.’ And I didn't go.”

In recent months, Cotler’s level of protection has been reduced, as the threat was perceived to not be as great as it had been.

“I laughed,” he said.

“I told them I’m happy to have it lowered because it was a little cumbersome to have so many people around when there are other people who need protection. But I follow Iran very closely, and it’s the other way around. Iran has been intensifying its transnational repression and assassinations. CSIS came out with a report recently that said exactly that.”

While no longer under 24-hour protection, he still has security accompanying him everywhere he goes.

So what have the last few years been like, knowing he’s at risk?

“You just factor it in to your lifestyle. You know that if you want to go somewhere, you have to notify the RCMP and give them two hours' notice so they can come pick you up and take you where you need to go. And after a while, you just know that that’s the reality you live with it.”

Cotler said his situation should be seen as a wake-up call. Iran has sleeper cells in Canada, along with a critical mass of repression and targets, including journalists, lawyers, dissidents, and leaders of the diaspora. While Russia and China also engage in transnational repression, he says Iran takes it a step further with assassination.

“The phenomenon of transnational repression and assassination means that we have to take the necessary measures here,” he said.

“This is a standing threat to our national security, and we have to take it seriously.”

A wide and well-documented trend

Cotler is the international chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, one of 13 organizations worldwide that are expressing deep alarm at the growing repression of lawyers for the legitimate exercise of their professional duties.

“Attacks on lawyers strike at the very heart of the rule of law, deny victims meaningful access to justice, and enable wider assaults on human rights and democratic institutions,” the groups said in a statement marking the International Day of the Endangered Lawyer.

From state capture of bar associations, systemic government oppression, politically motivated prosecutions and imprisonment for defending state opponents, reputational smears through propaganda, and forced disappearances, authoritarian regimes are deliberately targeting lawyers. The groups are calling out Russia, China, Iran, Afghanistan, Tanzania, and Turkey, among others, for what’s become a wide and well-documented trend.

“Lawyers are disbarred, disciplined, arbitrarily detained, prosecuted, forced into exile, subjected to surveillance and harassment, and in some cases killed, precisely because they seek to uphold the rights of their clients, including human rights defenders, opposition leaders, journalists, women, minorities, and other marginalized communities,” the statement said.

“Despite this, lawyers continue to perform a crucial function. Even in countries without an independent and impartial judiciary, where judicial outcomes are largely predetermined, lawyers document abuses, create records of testimonies and verdicts, and preserve evidence that can one day support accountability.”

While justice is never won easily, it cannot be won at all if those who defend it are left defenceless, the group says, which is why it is calling on states to end all forms of persecution, retaliation and harassment against lawyers for their professional activities, and immediately release all lawyers detained or imprisoned for representing clients or peacefully exercising their own rights.

In May 2025, after a decade of work, the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe introduced the first international treaty aimed at safeguarding lawyers from threats, harassment, and undue interference in their work.

The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of the Profession of Lawyer currently has 25 signatories.

“It’s the first internationally binding instrument to defend the legal profession,” Thierry Wickers, past president of the CCBE, told the IBA panel in November.

“It’s a recognition of the place and role we play in a democratic society.”

He noted that any country in the world can sign it, and that there is monitoring to ensure it’s correctly applied in countries that have added their names.

Of course, the convention is only effective if governments give it force. That’s why the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and other organizations are calling on countries to sign, ratify, and fully implement it.

“We encourage states in other regions to develop complementary binding standards so that protection of the legal profession becomes a universal norm.”

After all, as the Coalition makes clear in its report, the independence of the legal profession is not a professional privilege.

“It is a cornerstone of the rule of law and a prerequisite for access to justice, fair trial guarantees, and the effective protection of human rights. International law is unequivocal on this point.”",https://nationalmagazine.ca/MediaGallery/NM/NationalMagazine/Banners/Big%20Box/desktop_cotler.png?ext=.png,N,,2026-01-24 19:58:41.012577

A 5-year-old boy and his father who were detained by immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota are now being held at the South Texas Family Detention Center in Dilley, roughly 70 miles southwest of San Antonio, according to attorneys and members of Congress.

The transfer has drawn growing national attention, with lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates calling for the child’s release while federal officials defend the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

San Antonio Congressman Joaquin Castro said his office has been pressing federal authorities for information and urging ICE to release the boy.

“My staff and I have been working to make sure that this young boy is safe and to demand his release by ICE,” Castro said in a video posted to social media. He also criticized what he described as a lack of transparency from immigration officials.

Concerns about transparency intensified this week after U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he was denied entry to the Dilley facility while attempting to conduct congressional oversight. Murphy said federal authorities blocked his visit despite providing advance notice.

“Members of Congress have a constitutional right to inspect these facilities, and a clear statutory right as well,” Murphy said in a statement. “The fact they denied me access even with 24 hours’ notice should make everybody deeply fearful of what is happening inside this facility and facilities like it.”

School officials and community leaders in Minnesota have also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding the boy’s detention, saying the incident caused distress among children and families in the community.

The Department of Homeland Security rejected claims that the child was targeted or used as part of an enforcement tactic. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents were attempting to arrest the boy’s father, not the child.

“ICE did not target a child,” McLaughlin said in a statement posted on X. She said agents approached the father, who then ran, leaving his son behind. According to McLaughlin, one officer remained with the five-year-old “to ensure his safety” while other agents apprehended the father.

McLaughlin also disputed claims that the child was used to lure anyone from the home, calling those accounts “categorically false.” She said ICE officers are instructed to prioritize child safety during enforcement actions and that parents are typically given options during custody decisions.

“Parents are given the choice to remain with their children or designate a safe caregiver,” McLaughlin said, adding that keeping families together in detention is intended to avoid separation during immigration proceedings.

DHS officials have said the boy’s mother was not detained during the enforcement action. Advocates, however, say separating a child from one parent and transferring the family hundreds of miles away still raises serious concerns about trauma, access to legal counsel, and the well-being of young children.
