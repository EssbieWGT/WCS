Politico's reporting on Friday concerned a policy Trump instituted back in July, calling for all individuals facing deportation proceedings to be jailed without the possibility of seeking a release. Though the Trump administration has defended its crackdown by claiming that it is being applied to dangerous and violent criminals, Politico noted that many of the immigrants targeted by this new policy ""have lived in the U.S. for years, and sometimes decades, without incident and have been pursuing asylum or other forms of legal status.""

The response to this rule sparked a ""tidal wave of emergency lawsuits"" claiming it violated immigration laws and immigrants' due-process rights. As of Friday morning, when its piece was published, Politico found that in an overwhelming percentage of these lawsuits, judges ruled against Trump's policy, with a good number of them being judges he himself appointed.

At least 225 judges have ruled in more than 700 cases that the administration’s new policy, which also deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court, is a likely violation of law and the right to due process,"" the report explained. ""Those judges were appointed by all modern presidents — including 23 by Trump himself — and hail from at least 35 states, according to a Politico analysis of thousands of recent cases.""

The rate at which legal opposition to Trump's immigrant detention policy has grown is also considerable, with the number of judges who have ruled against the administration doubling in just the last month.

The scale of the push back feels even greater when considering the inverse: Politico found that only eight judges in the entire country, six of whom were Trump appointees, ruled in favor of the administration's position.

Judges have also grown ""exasperated"" by the volume of litigation flowing into their courts as a result of Trump's policy, making it difficult for them to keep up.

“The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority supporting the Court’s conclusion, given the continued onslaught of litigation being generated by [the administration’s] widespread illegal detention practices,” U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, a federal judge in California originally appointed by Bill Clinton, said in a comment from last week.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill, another Clinton appointee in Idaho. “This court joins the overwhelming majority.”",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60312296&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C83%2C0%2C84,N,,2025-11-28 11:57:26.894856

The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, and the Spanish Foreign Minister, José Manuel Albares, chose not to respond on Friday to the words of US President Donald Trump, in which he announced his intention to “permanently” suspend the entry of migrants “from all Third World countries” and to expel “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

“Immigration policies are a prerogative of each country, so, as far as we know, one thing is the declaration and another will be the legislative proposals. We’ll see what happens,” Kallas declared in Barcelona during the closing press conference of the tenth Regional Forum of the Union for the Mediterranean, held at the Pedralbes Palace in Barcelona.

“President Trump is the President of the United States and, therefore, is perfectly free to decide what the American citizens elected him to do,” Albares declared at the same press conference.

“I can speak on behalf of the Government of Spain, and the Government of Spain has a very clear policy regarding migration policy, asylum, and refugees, a policy that places human rights at the heart of the rights of every refugee, every asylum seeker, every migrant,” he continued.

“Certainly, when you look at the figures year after year, thanks to the cooperation with some of our friends who were here today—Morocco, Mauritania, to name the most important—the entry route for irregular immigration to Spain is the lowest in the entire European Union,” he added.

In a message posted on social media to mark Thanksgiving in the United States, Trump lashed out at “American Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain stupid, when it comes to Immigration.”

“The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels,” he claimed.

“This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.),” the US president asserted.

For all these reasons, the President of the United States announced his intention to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,” to end “the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and to remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

“I will end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” he added. “Happy Thanksgiving to all, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!” he concluded.",https://thediplomatinspain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donald-trump-2-1140x570-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 10:57:38.332554

Trump offered no details on how he would implement these policies or what he considers a “third world” country, an ill-defined and often offensive term for developing nations. Congress for years has failed to pass major immigration reforms, and courts have blocked some of his previous executive orders limiting immigration.

Article content

Earlier in the day, the president had announced the death of one of the guardsman, U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20. The attack by an Afghan national on the eve of Thanksgiving holiday has led Trump to amplify his anti-immigration policies.

Article content

Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.” He added that he would terminate millions of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

Article content

After the shooting, the White House halted Afghan immigration proceedings and ordered a review of those already in the U.S. The administration had already planned to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden and freeze their green card applications, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg this month.

On Thursday, Joseph Edlow, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a social media post that his agency — under Trump’s orders — is conducting “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”

Article content

The White House in June announced a ban on immigration from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and Sudan, and restrictions on seven others. In his first term, Trump barred travellers from Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.

Article content

Trump has also pursued aggressive immigration enforcement, deploying teams to cities over the objections of local officials and amid claims that authorities are wrongfully deporting migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections.

Article content

The administration has sharply reduced the refugee admissions cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a US$100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by tech companies and universities, and revoked thousands of visas. It is also challenging the constitutional right to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

Article content

Upon returning to office in January, Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions, which was promptly challenged in court. An appeals court allowed new admissions to be paused as the litigation continues, but ordered the government to provide services to refugees who already had arrived.

Suspect to face upgraded charges of murder in the first degree, says US attorney for DC

Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, this morning announced that charges against the suspected shooter were being upgraded.

Pirro told Fox News on Friday morning: “There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree.

“And we are hoping that the more information we can get and the more investigation that is going on 24/7 now, around the clock in Washington, the more we will find out about what actually happened in terms of this individual even being in this country and being in a position to ambush and shoot down an innocent young woman who was doing her duty to the people of this country.”

West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito on Thursday defended the deployment of National Guard troops from her state to Washington, DC.

Capito, a Republican, told Fox News that crime in the city had declined and questioned whether Democratic lawmakers criticizing former President Donald Trump’s decision to send troops to Washington had spoken with Guard members on the ground.

The two Guard members shot on Wednesday had been assigned to duty in Washington since August, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement.

West Virginia governor Patrick Morrisey reaffirmed his support for the state’s National Guard members deployed in Washington, DC.

“When you have these terrorists, when you have these evildoers, you’re not going to back down when they go after our servicemen and women,” Morrisey, a Republican, told CNN.

He said pulling back the Guard’s mission would amount to yielding to those responsible for the attack.

“The last thing we should do is reverse course and let the bad guys win,” he said, calling the perpetrators individuals who had “violated every law and societal norm.”

New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani said he was “devastated” by the death of Sarah Beckstrom.

In a post on X, he asked followers to take a moment to think of those “who have been plunged into unimaginable grief”.

The Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief David Smith wrote this analysis after the shooting earlier this week:

“Washington DC is considered a safe zone,” Donald Trump declared on Tuesday, veering off topic at the national Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House. “This was one of the most unsafe places anywhere in the United States. It is now considered a totally safe city.”

A day later, two national guardsmen from West Virginia were shot in a busy area a few blocks from the White House in downtown Washington. The ambush took place outside the Farragut West Metro railway station within sight of the Guardian’s office (I had been in the station three hours earlier and witnessed national guard troops milling around).

In a speech from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Wednesday evening, Trump said the suspect entered the US from Afghanistan in 2021. For the president it was a political opportunity and he was determined to exploit it. Immigration? Check. Law and order? Check. All Joe Biden’s fault? Check.

Trump accused his predecessor of allowing millions of violent criminals into the US and launched a xenophobic attack on Somalis in Minnesota: “Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country, and ripping apart that once great state.” Notably, the previous evening, his aide Stephen Miller had decried “the Somalification of America”, telling Fox News: “Look how powerful the Democrat Party became in Minnesota once they flooded it with 100,000 Somalians!”

Then Trump announced a review of the status Afghan nationals in the US. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.”

Raising the spectre of a newly aggressive crackdown by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the remarks came as little surprise from a president who has made illegal immigration central to his political identity. The White House regularly sends out lists and images of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes and could not resist playing up the suspect’s nationality.

Trump was elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration and his second term has been characterized by a campaign of mass deportations.

Construction sites and schools have been frequent targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America’s foreign-born workers account for nearly 31m jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump’s late-night Truth Social post was full of anti-immigrant invective.

The president blamed immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION”.

Trump’s threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.

The president asserted without evidence that millions of people born outside the US and now living there were to blame for America’s societal ills.

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump wrote. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won’t be here for long!”

One of two US national guard soldiers shot in a targeted attack near the White House this week has died, while the second is fighting for his life, Donald Trump has announced.

As part of his Thanksgiving call to US troops late on Thursday, the US president said he had been informed that Sarah Beckstrom, 20, had succumbed to her wounds.

“Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we’re talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person … She’s just passed away. She’s no longer with us,” Trump said in his first live remarks since the shooting on Wednesday.

Trump added that the second guard member, Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life”.

Beckstrom’s father had told the New York Times in a phone call earlier in the day that his daughter was unlikely to recover. “I’m holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom said. “She has a mortal wound. It’s not going to be a recovery.”

Trump steps up immigration crackdown after national guard member dies in DC attack

Donald Trump has said he will “permanently pause migration from all third world countries,” a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that has become a political flashpoint in the president’s ongoing crackdown on immigration.

In a social media post beginning with “a very happy Thanksgiving,” sent after 11pm on Thursday, the US president said his administration would “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens” and remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States”.

It as not clear how the president would enact such a “pause” in migration. Previous bans issued by his administration have faced challenges in the courts and in Congress.

Earlier in the night, Trump announced the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday. Authorities suspect the shooting was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who entered the US in September 2021 under a Biden-era programme that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands from Afghanistan after the chaotic US withdrawal from the country.

The extended rant came in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members who were deployed to patrol Washington, D.C., under Trump's orders on Wednesday.

A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan is facing charges for the shooting, which will likely be upgraded after the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom of the West Virginia National Guard.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrissey paid tribute to Beckstrom.

""Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation,"" said Morrissey. ""She answered the call to serve, stepped forward willingly, and carried out her mission with the strength and character that define the very best of the West Virginia National Guard.""

The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is accused of driving across the country to Washington in what officials described as an ""ambush."" Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in critical condition with unspecified injuries from the attack.

The suspect, currently in custody, was also shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening. He emigrated as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Refugee groups fear backlash

Hours before Trump took to social media, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 ""high-risk"" countries ""to the maximum degree possible.""

Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns. Afghanistan was among those countries.Trump, who began his social media post by extending Thanksgiving greetings to ""all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots,"" said that even as the U.S. has ""progressed technologically, Immigration Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many,"" detailing a list of claims about the effects of migration on employment and crime that have long been disputed.

""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,"" Trump said.

Trump cited the example of Somalians who have settled in Minnesota, seizing on a case of alleged COVID-19 fraud involving a Somalian-American group. In the process, the president used a slur for mentally disabled people to describe Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz.

Earlier Thursday, Trump met with reporters at his Florida estate. Asked by a reporter on Thursday if he blamed the shootings on all Afghans who came to the U.S., Trump said: ""No, but we've had a lot of problems with Afghans,"" without elaborating.

It was not not clear what mechanisms the White House might employ to fulfil Trump's stated objectives concerning clamping down on migration to the U.S.

Even before Trump's social media posts, groups that work with refugees worried about a backlash from the shooting incident.

""Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status … we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics,"" Matthew Soerens, a vice-president with World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization that helps settle refugees, told The Associated Press.

Ashraf Haidari, founder and president of Displaced International, which provides resources, advocacy and support to displaced people worldwide, told The Associated Press, ""even as we pursue accountability, one individual’s alleged actions cannot be allowed to define, burden, or endanger entire communities who had no part in this tragedy.""

Ratcheting up anti-migration policies

In his second presidential term, Trump's raids and deportations have disrupted communities across the U.S. The administration promised to focus on those with criminal records and those accused of violence, but many law-abiding residents and even U.S. citizens have occasionally been confronted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Control (CBP).

Several judges have assailed the administration for not appearing to afford due process to those facing deportation. Some who had never been convicted of a crime in the U.S. were deported straight to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

In August, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security urged Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients to leave, saying these U.S. residents who arrived from foreign countries as children don't enjoy ""any form of legal status in this country.""

The DHS spokesperson used the term ""self-deport,"" a term connected to a fraught history.

The Trump administration also wants to end birthright citizenship. Courts have blocked that bid, but the matter could be brought before the Supreme Court.

On the campaign trail that capped his remarkable political comeback, Trump said migrants were ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

Both Trump and Republicans have assailed what they say were lax border policies of Joe Biden's administration, as the U.S. saw an increase in border encounters between 2021 and mid-2024.

But the picture is more complex than the Republicans portray, think-tanks including the libertarian Cato Institute say.

The Biden administration encouraged more asylum claims from outside the country and developed an app for migrants that has been discontinued.

The Biden administration also moved to end Title 42 — a pandemic health measure that had the unintended consequence of encouraging some migrants to make repeat attempts to cross — but the end of the measure did not occur until mid-2023, a year later than planned, as over 20 attorney generals from Republican-led states challenged the move.

Trump's first term as president included several divisive and controversial incidents on the immigration file. That Trump administration in its first week spurred chaos at the nation's airports by announcing a travel ban from Muslim-majority countries, which was met with successful legal challenges until the White House revised the order.

In a departure from precedent, the first Trump administration separated many migrant children from their families arriving at southern border points, and failed to properly track the whereabouts of hundreds of children. That failure, a report later found, was an inevitable outcome of the relevant federal government agencies using different computer systems.

Trump in 2019 also lashed out at four Democratic members of Congress, all women, saying they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Three of the four women were born in the U.S. and the other, Somalian-American Ilhan Omar, became a naturalized citizen while a teenager in 2000.

On Friday, UN agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country.

In response to a reporter's question about Trump's remarks, United Nations human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva media briefing, ""They are entitled to protection under international law and should be given due process.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/9aa04b14-27bd-4756-8a65-039d8fb08f59,1764331319902/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C163%2C5743%2C3230%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-28 10:57:42.083265

In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S.","President Donald Trump has said he will ""permanently pause"" all immigration from what he called ""third world countries"" and demanded a program of ""reverse migration"" as he intensified his rhetoric after the National Guard shooting in Washington, D.C.

Trump offered few details as he disparaged and vowed to remove millions of migrants in the U.S., in a lengthy social media post late on Thanksgiving that came hours after he confirmed the death of National Guard troop Sarah Beckstrom, 20, in the shooting.

Officials have said that Wednesday’s attack on two troops was carried out by an Afghan national who worked with a CIA-backed group during the long war in Afghanistan. The incident has served as a catalyst for Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric into pledges that would likely face court challenges if enacted and further undermine America's global standing as a nation welcoming to immigrants.

""I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

It was not clear exactly which countries he was referring to, with the phrasing used in the past to refer to poorer nations. The Department of Homeland Security referred a reporter from the Reuters news agency to the 19 countries listed in a travel ban in June, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.

The comments drew swift criticism from two U.N. agencies, which on Friday urged the U.S. to continue to accept asylum seekers.

The president also threatened to ""end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our country"" and to ""denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic security.""

In remarks that will cause alarm among migrant advocacy and civil liberties groups, Trump said the government would deport any foreign national who was ""non-compatible with Western Civilization.""

He added: ""Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.""

The Trump administration also said Thursday that the government would reexamine the status of Green Card holders from 19 countries ""of concern,"" including Afghanistan.

In a subsequent post, Trump said that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Somali migrants were ""completely taking over the once great state of Minnesota.""

Trump has previously threatened action against Somalis and last week said he would end temporary protective status — which prevents deportations to dangerous countries — for Somali migrants in Minnesota, many of whom have fled a brutal civil war in the east African country.

It's unclear how many people this would affect but a report made for Congress in August put the number of people covered by the program nationally at 705. The president also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walk as ""retarded"" and said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, who was born in Somalia, ""probably came into the U.S.A. illegally"" and is from a ""decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation.""

Trump's threats, if enacted by legislation or executive orders, are likely to be challenged in the courts. In his first term, Trump banned people from several majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa from entering the U.S. This was challenged but eventually the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the ban's legality.

Migrant advocacy groups have called for calm and warned against using the D.C. attack to call for a wider crackdown on immigration or to remove the rights of Afghan residents.

""Using this horrific attack as an excuse to smear and punish every Afghan, every refugee, or every immigrant rips at something very basic in our Constitution and many faiths: the idea that guilt is personal, not inherited or collective,"" the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement early Friday.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun said: “When people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,” she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.

The term ""third world"" originated in the Cold War era to describe a country that wasn't aligned with the western NATO alliance or the USSR and the Warsaw Pact. This later evolved into shorthand for describing economically underdeveloped nations, particularly ones with high levels of poverty.

The term has been used to describe several African nations, but until the late 20th century was also attached to descriptions of China.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-government-shutdown-mn-1100-efa96e.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 10:57:47.177714

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead. FASKIANOS: Carolyn Kissane—Kissane, excuse me—thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion, for sharing your terrific insights with us, and to all of you for your questions and comments.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill in a Nov. 19 ruling that released 17 people arrested during an ICE raid at a racetrack.
The Trump administration expressed confidence that appeals courts, and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, would uphold the policy, saying they were forced to impose the detentions in response to Biden-era policies.
“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.
But judges have overwhelmingly disagreed, according to Politico's review of their rulings.","More than 200 judges in hundreds of cases have rejected the Trump administration’s attempts to lock up immigrants facing possible deportation, and they're getting sick of hearing challenges to those ""illegal"" efforts, according to reports.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement set off a tidal wave of emergency lawsuits July 8 with a policy change that led to their targets being arrested at workplaces, courthouses and immigration check-ins, and at least 225 judges in more than 700 cases have ruled against President Donald Trump's administration – compared with just eight who sided with the new mass detention policy, reported Politico.

“The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority supporting the Court’s conclusion, given the continued onslaught of litigation being generated by [the administration’s] widespread illegal detention practices,” wrote U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, in a Nov. 21 ruling.

Judges have noted the sheer volume of rulings against the administration in their rulings, which reflects their growing exasperation with the litigation prompted by a policy that has been rejected over and over as unlawful.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation — with more each day — have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention,” wrote U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill in a Nov. 19 ruling that released 17 people arrested during an ICE raid at a racetrack. “This court joins the overwhelming majority.”

There have been few broad attempts to block the ICE policy, but judges in Massachusetts and Colorado have recently certified class action lawsuits to challenge the detentions, and a California judge approved a nationwide class Tuesday that could immediately force the administration to provide bond hearings for detainees.

The Trump administration expressed confidence that appeals courts, and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, would uphold the policy, saying they were forced to impose the detentions in response to Biden-era policies.

In two Truth Social posts, he wrote that he would stop migration from “all Third World Countries” to enable “the U.S. system to fully recover.” He did not elaborate on which countries he meant or how he would achieve his aim.

Since the attack, which killed one of the soldiers, the Trump administration has issued a series of announcements tightening the immigration system, including pausing immigration from Afghanistan specifically.

Thursday night’s posts also seemed to target migrants who had become citizens. Mr. Trump said he would “denaturalize” migrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity” and remove people from the country who were “non-compatible with Western Civilization,” without detailing whom it would apply to or how.

Hours before the posts were published, Mr. Trump announced the death of U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, one of the National Guard members who was shot on Wednesday. The other victim was identified as Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, who officials said on Thursday was in critical condition.

Both victims had been deployed to Washington since August as part of what the Trump administration has described as a crackdown on crime.

The suspect in the shooting, whom officials identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was in custody after being shot by other National Guard soldiers during the attack. The authorities said he had driven from Washington State to carry out the attack.

Mr. Lakanwal was once part of a C.I.A.-backed paramilitary group working in Afghanistan and moved to the United States under a Biden-era immigration program for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule.

On Thursday, after Mr. Lakanwal was identified as the suspect, Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced new guidance introducing more “negative factors” for officials to consider in immigration cases of people from 19 countries. The change in guidance was under consideration before the shooting.

The administration said it would also re-examine “every Green Card” for immigrants from those 19 countries, which are subject to a travel ban enacted in June.

In the Thursday night social media posts, Mr. Trump singled out refugees from Somalia, who he claimed, without offering evidence, were “completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

The posts seemed to distill remarks the president made earlier on Thursday, in which he used the shooting to cast suspicion on refugees in general and attack Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from the state.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/28/multimedia/28xp-trump-immig-gpcl/28xp-trump-immig-gpcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 10:57:27.215985

Donald Trump has said he will “permanently pause migration from all third world countries”, a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that authorities suspect was carried out by an Afghan national.

The president said his administration would “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens” and remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States”. It was unclear how he would carry out such a pause, as his previous attempts have been challenged by the courts and Congress.

Trump’s social media post followed his announcement of the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday.

Authorities suspect the shooting was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the US in September 2021 after the country’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He was granted asylum in April this year, under the Trump administration, Reuters reported.

What do we know about the other guard member? Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.

What does Trump mean by ‘third world’? He did not identify the countries he intended to target or specify what he meant by the phrase.

US regulators ‘taking seriously’ allegations of bankers’ support for Epstein

US regulators say they are taking “very seriously” allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity, as they faced calls to investigate executives, including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, officials from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said they had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.

What has Warren said about Staley? She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.

Rescue efforts end at Hong Kong tower block fire as death toll reaches 128

The death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire that began on Wednesday has risen to 128, with about 200 missing, officials have said, as rescue efforts ended.

Fire crews combed the complex for survivors after the blaze swept through seven of its eight towers in one of the city’s deadliest fires. The inferno at the site, which housed more than 4,600 people, began during building renovations. The authorities said they believed a highly flammable styrofoam found in every elevator window fuelled the intensity of the fire.

What do we know about the missing people? About 200 people remain unaccounted for, including 89 unidentified bodies. Officials said the fire was extinguished but they needed to wait for the towers to cool before entering, as some areas remained above 392F (200C). Investigators estimate it will take three to four weeks to gather the evidence.

WASHINGTON— In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard service members in Washington, D.C., Wednesday by an Afghan national, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued new guidance allowing for negative, country-specific factors to be considered when vetting aliens from 19 high-risk countries. This guidance comes after the Trump administration halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan and the entry of Afghan nationals in its first year of office.

“My primary responsibility is to ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This includes an assessment of where they are coming from and why. Yesterday’s horrific events make it abundantly clear the Biden administration spent the last four years dismantling basic vetting and screening standards, prioritizing the rapid resettlement of aliens from high-risk countries over the safety of American citizens. The Trump administration takes the opposite approach. Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests. American lives come first.”

The updated guidance, including consideration of country-specific factors such as a country’s ability to issue secure identity documents, will further strengthen USCIS’ implementation of President Trump’s Presidential Proclamation (PP) 10949, Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats. It will allow USCIS officers to more meaningfully assess whether an alien is a threat to public safety and national security.

This policy guidance is effective immediately and applies to requests pending or filed on or after Nov. 27, 2025.

Vermont is one of 22 states arguing that the U.S. Department of Agriculture violated federal law in how it implemented changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, targets USDA guidance issued on October 31, 2025, that the states say wrongly strips food benefits from refugees, asylees, and other immigrants who entered the country through humanitarian pathways. The Vermont Attorney General’s Office announced the legal action in coordination with attorneys general from states including New York, California, Massachusetts, and Michigan.

What Is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act?

The dispute stems from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping federal law enacted on July 4, 2025, through the budget reconciliation process. The law, officially designated as H.R. 1, made substantial changes to federal spending programs, including new restrictions on which non-citizens can receive SNAP benefits. The law’s text limits SNAP eligibility to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents (green card holders), Cuban and Haitian entrants, and citizens of nations with Compact of Free Association agreements with the United States.

A key provision of the law requires lawful permanent residents to wait five years after obtaining their green card before becoming eligible for SNAP. The law also introduced what it calls the “State Quality Control Incentive,” which penalizes states financially if their error rates in distributing benefits exceed certain thresholds. According to analysis by Holland & Knight, states with error rates above 6% could become liable for 15% to 20% of benefit costs—expenses the federal government has historically covered entirely.

What the States Are Arguing

The Refugee Eligibility Question

The core of the lawsuit involves how the USDA interprets the law’s effect on refugees and asylees. Under a 1996 federal law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, refugees and asylees were explicitly exempted from the five-year waiting period for SNAP benefits. That exemption, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1612, has allowed refugees to receive food assistance immediately upon arrival and to continue receiving it after they adjust to lawful permanent resident status, as they are required to do after one year in the country.

The states argue that this exemption remains in effect because the One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not explicitly repeal it. According to the complaint filed by New York and other states, the USDA’s October guidance omits “former refugees” from the list of individuals exempt from the five-year bar. This omission, the states contend, effectively rewrites federal law through agency guidance rather than congressional action.

The practical effect of the USDA’s interpretation is significant. Under the agency’s reading, a refugee who has lived legally in the United States for one year and then obtains a green card—as required by law—would lose SNAP eligibility for four additional years. The National Immigration Law Center has described this as creating a perverse incentive where gaining permanent legal status results in loss of food assistance.

The Timeline Problem

The lawsuit also challenges the USDA’s implementation timeline as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Federal regulations at 7 CFR § 275.12 provide states with a 120-day grace period after new rules take effect, during which errors in benefit calculations are not counted against them. This grace period exists because implementing complex eligibility changes requires states to update computer systems, retrain caseworkers, and notify affected recipients.

The USDA’s implementation memorandum, issued October 31, 2025, declared that the grace period had already expired as of November 1—meaning states had effectively one day’s notice. The USDA guidance document asserts that because the law was enacted July 4, the 120-day period ran from that date rather than from when the agency issued its detailed instructions.

The states argue this interpretation is “impossible under USDA’s own regulations.” Without guidance on who qualifies under the new rules, state agencies could not program their eligibility systems or train staff. The late issuance of guidance coupled with the retroactive expiration of the grace period, the states contend, guarantees that errors will occur—triggering the law’s new financial penalties.

Financial Stakes for Vermont

Vermont’s 3SquaresVT program distributes approximately $151 million in food benefits annually, according to Seven Days. Under the new penalty structure, if Vermont’s error rate exceeds 6%, the state could become responsible for 15% of benefit costs—potentially more than $22 million annually.

Larger states face proportionally larger exposure. New York, which distributes $7.35 billion in SNAP benefits, could face penalties exceeding $1 billion annually according to the New York Attorney General’s complaint. Massachusetts has estimated potential penalties of $131 million to $394 million annually based on current error rates, according to state government updates.

The states describe being placed in what the Vermont Attorney General’s office calls an “impossible position”: either terminate benefits for recipients who may be legally eligible under federal statute, or continue providing benefits and risk substantial financial penalties if courts ultimately uphold the USDA’s interpretation.

Related Legal Actions

This lawsuit is one of several legal challenges to federal SNAP policy currently proceeding through federal courts. Earlier in November, New York Attorney General Letitia James obtained a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from attempting to claw back SNAP benefits during a federal government shutdown. That order remains in effect while related litigation continues.

The District of Columbia Attorney General has also filed suit to protect SNAP benefits, noting that more than 320 small retailers in the District depend on SNAP revenue. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced her state’s participation in the coalition lawsuit the same day Vermont filed.

What the Law Says

The legal dispute turns on a principle of statutory interpretation known as the “canon against implied repeal.” Under this doctrine, courts presume that when Congress passes a new law, it does not automatically override previous laws unless it explicitly says so or the two laws directly contradict each other.

The states argue that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the 1996 refugee exemption can coexist: the new law defines who qualifies as a lawful permanent resident, while the older law specifies that refugees who become permanent residents remain exempt from the waiting period. Because the new law does not mention or repeal the 1996 exemption, the states contend it remains valid law.

The USDA’s position, as reflected in its guidance, appears to treat the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a comprehensive restatement of non-citizen eligibility that supersedes previous frameworks. The Church World Service, a refugee resettlement organization, has published analysis noting that if the USDA’s interpretation is upheld, it would represent a significant departure from 30 years of policy treating refugees as exempt from waiting periods for public benefits.

What Happens Next

The coalition of state attorneys general is seeking an injunction to block the USDA guidance from taking effect while the case proceeds. If a court grants preliminary relief, states would be able to continue administering SNAP under the previous rules while the underlying legal questions are resolved.

The case could take months or longer to resolve at the district court level, with appeals likely regardless of the outcome. If the states prevail, the USDA would be required to issue new guidance consistent with the court’s interpretation of the law. If the federal government prevails, states would need to implement the eligibility restrictions as the USDA directs or face the financial penalties established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

A final resolution of the statutory conflict between the 2025 law and the 1996 refugee exemption may ultimately require either a Supreme Court ruling or a technical correction from Congress. Until then, the question of whether refugees who become lawful permanent residents retain their food assistance eligibility remains legally contested.

For Vermont SNAP recipients with questions about their eligibility, the Vermont Department for Children and Families administers the 3SquaresVT program and can provide information about current rules and any changes as they occur.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OcQz!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3b2aad5-cb91-450a-8bce-52453804347f_1648x1122.png",N,,2025-11-28 09:59:55.994986

After less than a year spent destroying the federal government, sending troops into Democratic-led cities, violating the rights of immigrants and trying to rig the 2026 elections, momentum is no longer on his side.

The Supreme Court appears poised to axe Trump’s flagship tariffs. His domestic troop deployments and political prosecutions are on shaky legal footing. His plan to gerrymander his way to a GOP victory in the midterms may be backfiring. And his efforts to suppress the Epstein files failed when his usually compliant Republican Party pushed back.

Even Trump’s relationship with the public is fraying. After much talk about the cost of groceries — an “old-fashioned,” “beautiful” word that the president once defined as “a bag with different things in it” — Americans have grown tired of waiting for prices to drop. Instead, it’s Trump’s polling numbers that are falling.

This year, the only ones in the administration having a good Thanksgiving may be Waddle and Gobble, the two turkeys Trump pardoned earlier this week.

The harder they come…

Trump burst into 2025 full throttle. After taking the oath of office in January, he effectively declared war on the federal government, firing civil servants and upending foreign aid as we know it.

The president sought to rapidly change the country and its government largely through decree. In his first 100 days, he signed 142 executive orders or memorandums — more than any other president in U.S. history.

His aim was to reinterpret the Constitution, vastly expand the executive branch’s power over federal elections and cleave full departments from the federal government without congressional approval.

Under the sway of Stephen Miller and other immigration hardliners, the new administration moved quickly to conduct “mass deportations.”

Across the country, masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have detained tens of thousands of people. Despite promises to arrest violent criminals and drug cartels, Trump’s immigration crackdowns have primarily targeted ordinary undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers.

The administration has also run roughshod over due process. In March, the U.S. agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison hundreds of people — without trial — in its notorious Terrorism Confinement Center. Its illegal removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran asylum seeker, became a prominent early example of the Trump administration’s egregious human rights violations.

In June, Trump began to federalize National Guard troops for deployment in major Democratic-led cities, an attempt to integrate the military into routine policing.

That same month, the president moved to secure Republican control over the country for years to come: He urged Republican-controlled states to redraw their congressional districts and engineer a GOP advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. Several states — Texas, North Carolina, Missouri — scrambled to answer the president’s call.

Taking another page out of the authoritarian playbook, Trump also went after his political opponents.

In September, he ousted the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and appointed his ally Lindsey Halligan to the role. She quickly pressed charges against former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two of the president’s longtime perceived enemies.

…the harder they fall

At the worst moments this year, Trump appeared poised to rewrite American governance and engineer a long-term electoral advantage for his party. But over the past several months, his attack on American democracy has encountered a string of setbacks and outright defeats.

The administration is currently tied up in hundreds of court cases over its most extreme actions. Its aggressive immigration raids have provoked intense pushback in cities like Chicago, Illinois and Portland, Oregon.

Some states — Kansas, New Hampshire, and, initially, Indiana — balked at his calls to gerrymander.

Perhaps most importantly, courts have started to hand down rulings blocking and delaying some of Trump’s most egregious actions and executive orders. Those decisions have been particularly important for slowing Trump’s unprecedented drive for nationwide mid-decade partisan redistricting.

Earlier this month, in a case that predated Trump’s redistricting war, a judge in Utah ruled that a gerrymandered congressional map passed by the Republican-controlled legislature violated a voter-approved constitutional amendment forbidding partisan gerrymanders. She ordered the state to adopt a more fair one. Under this new map, Utah Democrats will have a good shot at winning one of the state’s four congressional seats.

A week later, a panel of three federal judges blocked* Texas from using a new gerrymandered map in the 2026 election. In a scathing opinion, Judge Jeffrey Brown — a Trump appointee, no less — wrote that the map likely represented an illegal racial gerrymander.

That ruling was particularly monumental because the Lone Star State’s decision to redistrict and give Republicans five more safe Congressional seats had set off a gerrymandering arms race across the country.

In direct response to the Texas gerrymander, California legislators decided that they too needed to redraw their map to cancel out Texas’ five new GOP seats. Under state law, they were required to get the voters’ approval. During the Nov. 4 elections — which saw Democrats sweep the polls, winning gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey — California voters overwhelmingly approved their plan. And Virginia is also moving to redraw its congressional map.

After Texas’ loss in court, it appears Trump’s redistricting efforts could be backfiring.

Trump is also losing his battles to send in the military for policing. The Supreme Court is currently considering a technical question about the precise language of the archaic statute Trump used to federalize thousands of National Guard troops for domestic deployments. That suggests justices may issue a ruling that will undermine most of these deployments.

Even those launched under other laws appear to be at risk. On Nov. 18, a Tennessee state judge found that a group of local officials challenging Gov. Bill Lee’s (R) decision to deploy Guard troops to Memphis at Trump’s urging would likely succeed in arguing it violated state law.

Two days later, a federal court rejected Trump’s assertion that he had the right to independently mobilize the D.C. National Guard for routine police work. Instead, the judge found that the deployment of more than 2,000 Guard troops to Washington was unlawful and violated the District’s right to govern itself.

His political prosecutions are also failing. On Monday, a federal judge dismissed without prejudice the DOJ’s cases against Comey and James after finding that Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi circumvented vacancy laws in appointing Halligan.

The judge ruled that Halligan was serving unlawfully when she sought indictments against Comey and James — making her the fourth Trump-appointed acting U.S. attorney determined to be illegitimate.

Because the statute of limitations on the charges against Comey had expired, the DOJ is unlikely to be able to resurrect its case against him.

That ruling was not just a loss for Trump, but also an embarrassment. Just days earlier, the DOJ admitted that Halligan — an insurance lawyer who had never before prosecuted a case — never actually presented the final indictment used to charge Comey to the grand jury, a revelation that likely made the charges void.

It’s not over yet

Of course, we’re not anywhere near the finish line yet. The midterms are still a year away, and Trump has three more years in office.

There’s still a lot that he and his allies can do to gerrymander up a congressional majority in 2026 and exact retribution on his foes. And that process is already underway.

After the Republican-controlled Missouri legislature redrew its congressional maps at Trump’s behest, voting rights activists started gathering signatures to organize a state-wide referendum on the gerrymander and let voters decide.

Republicans — including the national Republican National Committee — are fighting tooth and nail to prevent the Missouri voters from having their say. They’re trying to disqualify thousands of signatures, sending out threatening mass text messages, and challenging voters’ very right to override the state legislature. Missouri voters* are also fighting back in court — they’ve filed multiple lawsuits arguing mid-decade redistricting violates the state constitution.

After the federal judges rejected Texas’ illegal racial gerrymander, the state appealed. The Supreme Court may soon overturn the lower court’s decision and let Texas use the new map in 2026 — and potentially earn the GOP five more congressional seats. Republicans are also seeking to block California’s new map.

And while Trump’s political prosecutions may be faltering, the administration appears to have a lot more in the works. John Bolton, Trump’s former national security advisor turned frequent critic, is under indictment.

The administration is slinging allegations of mortgage fraud at numerous prominent Democrats and Trump foes. There are signs that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida may be preparing to open a special grand jury criminal investigation against officials who have attempted to hold Trump accountable over the past decade.

And the DOJ is targeting other Democratic lawmakers and critics, including six members of Congress who recently reminded soldiers that they are obligated to refuse illegal orders.

But, for the moment, the administration’s court losses are piling up. Some of its designs on American democracy are hitting a multitude of obstacles — chief among them public opinion.

Despite his claims of record-high approval ratings, Trump’s actions over the past 10 months have angered a majority of the American public. Aggregate polling numbers indicate that, since turning negative in March, Trump’s numbers continue to nosedive.

Large-scale protests across the country only emphasize his unpopularity. In fact, the nationwide No Kings demonstrations on Oct. 19 were likely the country’s largest single-day protest ever.

The battle isn’t over. But, this Thanksgiving, the only thing Trump may be gobble-gobbling is a heaping plate of defeats.

Local law enforcement agencies would also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards.
In March, Houston officers were directed to contact immigration authorities when they encountered anyone with a deportation order ICE listed in a national database.
We enforce state and city laws, not immigration, not ICE,” Whitmire said at a Nov. 12 City Council meeting.","SAN ANTONIO — When Immigration and Customs Enforcement came calling on Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux months ago to ask his officers to assist in supporting President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration enforcement operations, the chief of police in the third-largest city in this very red state said no.

On the other hand, in Texas’ largest city, Houston Mayor John Whitmire, a Democrat, has been under fire from residents and officials since he was quoted in the Houston Chronicle acknowledging some cooperation with ICE. The police department there has no formal agreement with the agency, but calls from the city’s police force to ICE, mostly as result of traffic stops, have risen 1000% since President Donald Trump was re-elected, the Houston Chronicle reported based on public records.

The approaches in Dallas and Houston show the quandary some police departments face as they weigh their cities’ public safety priorities against the Trump administration’s pressures to multiply its enforcement forces. Texas’ largest cities, where the majority of its Black and Hispanic populations are concentrated, face a tough choice: partner with ICE and risk blowback from their own communities or take a pass and risk seeing the administration send ICE, Border Patrol or National Guard troops to their cities. Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, chose the latter option, only to see federal immigration enforcement arrive on their streets.

Texas Republican lawmakers and the governor have generally sided with helping the Trump administration by passing laws that require cooperation. Sheriffs’ offices in Texas counties with populations of more than 100,000 are required by law to sign an agreement with ICE by December 2026. Texas’ Department of Public Safety, which includes highway troopers, has also signed an agreement with ICE.

Sheriffs’ offices and other law enforcement departments around the country, including in cities like Las Vegas and Miami, are signing up with unprecedented speed to a decades-old program to partner with ICE, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that has surveyed departments about the partnerships over the years.

A spokesperson frofor m the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement: “ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country. ... We encourage all state and local law enforcement agencies to become a 287(g) partner and join us in the fight to make America safe again.”

Nonetheless, none of the police departments of the top 10 U.S. cities, which include Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, have signed on as partners with ICE, according to a list the agency posts on its website.

In many cases, not cooperating comes with turning down money that is being offered to local and state law enforcement agencies as an incentive, said Muzaffar Chishti, who directs the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute.

“What has added a whole new wrinkle to this is money, which has placed more and more pressure on ICE officers and these 287(g) officers to arrest and detain more people,” he said. The 287(g) program, whose use has ebbed and flowed under different administrations, gives immigration enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement agencies.

DHS said its program includes reimbursements for each 287(g)-trained officer’s annual salary and benefits, as well as a percentage of their overtime. Local law enforcement agencies would also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards.

Comeaux said ICE had offered Dallas up to $25 million in reimbursement for partnering with it.

But he decided, and a joint City Council committee affirmed in a Nov. 6 meeting, that pulling police officers from their current duties and putting them on immigration enforcement arrests would be detrimental to what so far is a trend of lower homicide rates, lower violent crime, fewer traffic deaths and improved police response times, according to Comeaux. The committee voted against partnering.

“It will not make Dallas any safer, because we are aggressively going after those who are committing violent crimes already,” Comeaux said at the time, “so this program would not help us in any kind of way.”

In a statement, Comeaux repeated that he turned down an offer of $25 million from ICE because it would not have covered overtime costs and officers would be reassigned under federal oversight, which could negatively affect response times and erode public trust.

Although the Dallas Police Department does not partner with ICE, the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office does notify it about immigrants in its custody who may have immigration violations. An ICE field office in Dallas that serves North Texas and Oklahoma was the site of a shooting in September, in which two people who were detained were killed and a third was wounded.

Things have been less clear in Houston, where Whitmire, the mayor, has come under fire locally following his statement about cooperating with ICE. In March, Houston officers were directed to contact immigration authorities when they encountered anyone with a deportation order ICE listed in a national database. Whitmire sought to clarify his comments amid uproar in the city, which has a high immigrant population.

“We are the Houston Police Department. We enforce state and city laws, not immigration, not ICE,” Whitmire said at a Nov. 12 City Council meeting.

The department has had to defend its calls to ICE, including one in April when it alerted ICE about a woman from El Salvador after she had dialed 911 to report domestic abuse.

The Houston Police Department said in a statement that it does not ask about immigration status but that officers are “required to contact the issuing agency when they encounter a person with a warrant. After verifying the warrant with ICE, the officer detains the individual and transfers custody to an ICE agent.”

Whitmire’s office said in a statement that while immigration matters fall under federal jurisdiction, “anyone who breaks the law in the City of Houston will be held accountable. When police encounter an individual with an outstanding warrant from another law enforcement agency, they are required to notify that agency.”

ICE has added hundreds of thousands of administrative warrants — which are for civil violations and are not signed by judges — to the National Crime Information Center database, which police officers use to check for warrants when they pull someone over for a traffic stop.

The president of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, Douglas Griffith, told NPR that the warrants are showing up in the database and that “if they pop up with a warrant, then we have no alternative but to take those people into custody.”

But ICE officials who spoke at the Dallas City Council committee meeting this month said assisting the agency with immigration enforcement would be a benefit.

“It’s good for the city, because you definitely have some individuals that fall through the cracks,” an ICE official who identified himself only as an assistant Dallas field office director named Francis said at the meeting. For example, he said, a person released on traffic citations could have been previously deported, re-entered the country illegally and possibly committed offenses.

He also pointed to the arrest by a police officer with 287(g) training in Oklahoma of a foreign-born person who had been flagged by Interpol.

But Comeaux, a former special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration Houston office, told council members he rejected joining the 287(g) program because the “most important thing right now for us to keep everyone safe and keep the community believing in their police department, that it’s doing the very best to serve them every single day.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251125-houston-dps-immigration-mn-1620-d1d566.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 06:56:17.957758

“They wouldn’t tell her why she was being detained,” Pomerleau told The Boston Globe.
“She didn’t understand it at all.” Lopez Belloza was taken to ICE’s Burlington field office in an unmarked car, according to the lawyer.
“I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” Lopez Belloza told the Globe from Honduras, recounting her frightening experience.
“She was in a court process that she thought ended favorably, she was then nine or 10-years-old,” Pomerleau told 7 News Boston.","A Massachusetts college student has been deported to Honduras after attempting to fly down to Austin, Texas, to surprise her family for Thanksgiving.

Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19 year-old business major at Babson College in Wellesley who came to the U.S. in 2014 when she was eight years old, was detained at Boston Logan International Airport last Thursday as she was about to board her flight, having already successfully passed through security without incident.

Todd Pomerleau, her attorney, explained that Lopez Belloza had been told there was a problem with her ticket when she scanned her boarding pass and referred to a customer service desk, whereupon she was taken into federal custody.

“They wouldn’t tell her why she was being detained,” Pomerleau told The Boston Globe. “She didn’t understand it at all.”

Lopez Belloza was taken to ICE’s Burlington field office in an unmarked car, according to the lawyer. Then, in a bitter irony, she was flown to Texas on Saturday after all, only to subsequently find herself deported to Honduras, a country to which she has not returned since childhood.

Only after 48 hours was she able to call her frantic parents from her grandparents’ home in San Pedro Sula to let them know what had happened, heartbroken to miss the holidays with her young sisters and fearful for the future.

Speaking to CBS Austin, Pomerleau scathingly characterized the tactics used to detain his client as an “unconstitutional bag job” and Lopez Belloza as “a Dreamer living a draconian nightmare right now.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Independent: “On November 20, Customs and Border Protection arrested Any Lopez-Belloza, an illegal alien from Honduras, as she was attempting to board a flight at Boston Logan International Airport.

“This illegal alien entered the country in 2014 and an immigration judge ordered her removed from the country in 2015, over 10 years ago. She has illegally stayed in the country since. Lopez-Belloza will remain in ICE custody pending removal.”

The Independent also reached out to ICE for comment.

“I have worked so hard to be able to be at Babson my first semester, that was my dream,” Lopez Belloza told the Globe from Honduras, recounting her frightening experience. “I’m losing everything.”

Nayna Gupta, policy director at the American Immigration Council, has been helping the student’s family since her plight became known and said Lopez Belloza had been the subject of an outstanding removal order since 2017, although she had not been aware of it.

“[Her family] didn’t know to show up somewhere, and she certainly had no idea of any of this,” Gupta said, explaining that immigration courts can issue such orders without the subject being present and that notifications are all too frequently mailed to incorrect addresses.

“People with final orders of removal, like this young college freshman from Babson College, are highly vulnerable under an administration that is pursuing such a cruel and indiscriminate deportation agenda,” she added, alluding to President Donald Trump’s second term crackdown on illegal immigration.

According to court documents ABC News, a federal judge had ordered the government not to remove Lopez Belloza from the U.S. and not to transfer her outside of Massachusetts, instructions that appear to have been ignored.

“She was in a court process that she thought ended favorably, she was then nine or 10-years-old,” Pomerleau told 7 News Boston. “She’s a child under the immigration law. She’s under the age of 21. She’s going to college. She has zero record.

“We believe her constitutional rights were violated, the way she was arrested, not having any notice why she’s arrested, not shown any documents to justify her abrupt, egregious removal from the United States of America.

“You’re supposed to be thankful this time of the year. Just be thankful ICE hasn’t destroyed your family.”

Ricky Soto, a family friend who works with the student’s father Francis at a Texas tailoring business, said that he had arranged the fateful ticket for Lopez Belloza to return to her parents and subsequently helped them to find legal backing.

“It really didn’t feel like it was real life because nothing made sense,” he told the Globe. “I can only imagine how terrifying that was for her… She was so excited, because she wasn’t expecting to come home.”

He added that the family had endured a tough time since settling in the U.S. but were “really proud” when their eldest daughter had been accepted into Babson on a scholarship.

Pomerleau said his client was “really sad” about what had happened to her, missed her family and was concerned that she may never be able to complete her finals, which are scheduled in a matter of weeks.

“I told her, ‘We’re going to fight like hell until we bring you back,’” he said.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/27/16/30/Any-Lucia-Lopez-Belloza.png?trim=39,0,313,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-28 07:57:04.005016

Last Wednesday, shortly after 2:00 p.m., 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal opened fire on several National Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington. The attack occurred on the eve of Thanksgiving near the busy Farragut West Metro station, frequented by tourists and federal employees due to its proximity to the White House. Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded: 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom died last night after being shot twice, once in the chest and once in the head; her comrade, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, is still fighting for his life after undergoing surgery.

Lakanwal was immediately arrested by police after an exchange of gunfire in which he was wounded. He is an Afghan refugee who entered the United States on September 8, 2021, as part of a program to repatriate personnel who had worked with U.S. authorities during the war against the Taliban. According to State Department data, Operation Allies Welcome — approved during the administration of Democratic president Joe Biden — helped some 76,000 Afghans travel to the United States to avoid falling into the hands of the Taliban, who seized control of the country after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops. Many of them worked with the CIA or the U.S. military on high-risk security missions or assisted diplomats as translators and interpreters.

Most had to undergo rigorous vetting by U.S. security agencies to rule out concerns about their backgrounds and confirm they had no ties to the Taliban. This process has been one of the main points of criticism from President Donald Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly insisted that it allowed Taliban fighters to slip through. Although efforts were made to provide all necessary security guarantees, the investigation carried out by Republicans in Congress reveals some shortcomings due to the speed of the admissions process.

Refugees who passed the vetting process were granted a permit allowing them to reside in the United States for two years with temporary status. More than 40% of those admitted to the program were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) because they took great risks to defend the United States or were relatives of those who did, the Department of Homeland Security explained to several U.S. media outlets on Thursday.

Upon arriving in the United States, Lakanwal settled in Bellingham, a small town north of Seattle, where he lived with his wife and five children. After his two-year temporary visa expired, he applied for permanent asylum in December 2024. His request was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office, according to State Department sources consulted by CNN.

Trump and his team moved swiftly on Wednesday after learning the identity of the attacker who targeted the members of the National Guard. They quickly criticized the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal into the country and used the case to push for tougher immigration policies. They ordered a suspension of the review of Afghan immigration procedures and a reassessment of the permits of those already living in the United States. According to AP, this raises the possibility that the settlement rights of Afghan allies who worked with U.S. forces could be restricted.

“[Lakanwal] was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about,” Trump said Wednesday night in an extraordinary, pre-recorded address following the shooting in the nation’s capital. “Nobody knew who was coming in, nobody knew anything about it. His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in the history of our country,” he added before a shocked nation on the eve of Thanksgiving, one of the most cherished holidays for families.

“This attack highlights the fundamental national security threat facing our nation. Twenty million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from countries that you don’t want to even know about. No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” the Republican president added during his speech, exaggerating the figures.

After the shooting, the government stopped processing all immigration applications from Afghan citizens “pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said on X. “We must now reexamine every single alien who’s entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” Trump added in the video recorded Wednesday.

Some supporters of the repatriation process warned on Thursday of the risks now faced by those who escaped the Taliban. “I don’t want people to leverage this tragedy into a political ploy,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac. “We aren’t going to be tricked. One man’s lunatic behavior mustn’t be used to vilify a whole community, especially one that stood by us for so long,” he wrote on social media.

The immigration policy promoted by Trump is one of the most controversial issues at the start of his second term in the White House. He has ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pursue and deport undocumented immigrants. These enforcement actions have sparked large protests in cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston. So far this year, ICE has participated in more than 60,000 immigrant arrests. In addition, Trump has ordered a review of the cases of 200,000 refugees admitted during Biden’s term and is ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) granted to political refugees, affecting tens of thousands of people from Venezuela, South Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, and other countries.

Trump also ordered a comprehensive review of green card holders from high-risk countries on Thursday, according to a post on X by Joseph Edlow, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” he wrote on the social network.

Trump went one step further in a post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday: “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions.”

The National Guard on the streets

The other controversial issue is the presence of National Guard troops on the streets of some U.S. cities, coincidentally all governed by Democrats.

In early August, Trump issued an order to deploy approximately 2,600 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., in response to what he described as a “crime emergency.” The National Guard is a military force under the command of the governors of each of the 50 states. Its members are reservists — they are volunteers who work or study and are only deployed in specific situations, such as natural disasters or large-scale civil unrest.

Soldiers typically patrol in small groups. They walk the streets and public spaces, especially near subway stations. The National Guard’s role is to deter crime, and while its members cannot make arrests, they have assisted in immigration raids ordered by the White House.

Trump boasts that there is less crime on the streets of Washington, D.C. after the deployment of troops, contrary to official statistics from the city’s police department.

The deployment of these troops has drawn criticism from Democrats and numerous federal officials in the capital. Washington’s Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration over the deployment, according to the Associated Press. A federal judge ordered the troops to withdraw and the mission to be shut down. He has given the government until December 11 to comply with the order and to appeal the decision.

Some army officials have also expressed concern about the risk the deployment could pose to troops, according to the AP. It “presents an opportunity for criminals, violent extremists, issue motivated groups and lone actors to advance their interests, given the prominence of locality, and expected media coverage for the mission,” an internal memo states.

Despite criticism over the deployment of troops in cities, Trump ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington on Wednesday, following the shooting. The city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, expressed her opposition to the deployment. “These young people should be at home in West Virginia with their families,” she stated.

In a video recorded on Wednesday, the Republican president also referred to the Somali community in Minnesota — where nearly 90,000 Somalis live, the largest such community in the country — even though they had nothing to do with the incident: “An example is Minnesota, where hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state. Billions of dollars are lost and gangs of Somalians come from a country that doesn’t even have a government. No laws, no water, no military, no nothing, as their representatives in our country preach to us about our Constitution and how our country is no good.”

Trump’s words reflect the White House strategy of toughening immigration policies on any pretext, without sufficient justification.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/7ITWIIWR6JOHDBIEHP3P4IAYYE.jpg?auth=16578d7bda5a2713ba3ddd08ec678a54405871353e745b8d03b7f23b249b90dd&width=1200,N,,2025-11-28 05:56:23.598748

""We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity.
Pope Leo XIV, an American, has also come out against federal immigration policy, calling it ""extremely disrespectful.""
He urged balance in immigration policy.","Delaware's largest Roman Catholic figure recently joined other bishops in the U.S. in condemning federal immigration policy.

The Most Rev. William Koenig, bishop of the Diocese of Wilmington, runs the diocese for all Catholic parishes of Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore. He joined 215 other Catholic bishops in approving a statement advocating for reform of federal immigration policies to ensure human dignity and respect, the Nov. 12 statement said.

The statement said there is a balance to be found between national security and human rights, and it calls for compassion toward immigrants.

""Despite obstacles and prejudices, generations of immigrants have made enormous contributions to the well-being of our nation,"" the statement reads. ""We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity. For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.""

Koenig was even featured in a video promoting the statement on the social media of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The statement came from the Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore, where the bishops deliberated over this topic and issued this rare statement.

What Delaware's bishop has to say

In an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, Koenig said a small group was asked to draft a statement, which was worked on by small groups within the conference. The process took a few days, he said.

Statements like this can be released only when all the bishops are together, which is usually during the twice-annual plenary meetings.

Koenig said he is on board with the statement and hopes to see immigration reform.

""They're vital parts of the community,"" he said. ""Let's help them become naturalized.""

He emphasized that exclusionary treatment of immigrants is not a new phenomenon. The official statement says that the bishops ""are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.""

While deportations were common under the Biden and Obama administrations, both Trump administrations have used mass deportations and enhanced border security as key selling points to voters for nearly a decade. The increase of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago has led to protests from locals.

A ProPublica investigation said that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, and inhumane treatment by ICE agents has been frequently reported over the course of the year.

Growing sentiment toward immigration reform

The statement on behalf of all bishops is pretty rare, but the sentiment is not unheard of recently. Over the summer, the Dioceses of Nashville and San Bernadino excused church members from attending weekly Mass over fear of ICE agents conducting arrests at local churches.

Pope Leo XIV, an American, has also come out against federal immigration policy, calling it ""extremely disrespectful.""

Koenig said everyone is made in God's image and likeness, and that he would like to see additional pathways to citizenship rather than immigrants treated with no respect. He takes a biblical perspective toward the issue.

""I certainly would want to respect someone who doesn't look like us, someone who isn't from our country,"" Koenig said. ""If the person needs more time to get legal status, try to work with that person.""

He urged balance in immigration policy. He understands the need for national security, he said, but wants the country to ""temper justice with mercy.""

""Do what we need to do, but we need to do it with compassion,"" he said.

The reactions to the pope's and bishops' statements from the Delaware Catholic congregation has been pretty quiet, according to Koenig. A study from the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Delawareans were religious, 19% of whom were Catholic. He said the Hispanic community, very often targeted by ICE nationally, have great faith and ""enrich"" the diocese with its enthusiasm.

He said the role the diocese's parishes will continue to play in Delaware is to offer spiritual and pastoral care, on top of the charitable work many parishes already undertake. He also encouraged everyone to read the entire statement.

Outlook The convergence of Delaware fiduciary duty expansion and intensified federal enforcement and regulatory oversight signals a new era of personal accountability, both civilly and criminally.
Effective oversight is no longer just good governance; it is personal risk mitigation.","Courts, regulators, enforcers, and plaintiffs’ counsel used to clearly distinguish between entity-level and individual responsibility. But emerging theories of corporate officer liability are eroding that long-standing separation.

Recent developments in Delaware and federal enforcement policy signal a heightened risk of personal civil and criminal exposure for executives under both state fiduciary duty doctrines and federal fraud and control-person statutes.

Given these changes, as well as the rise of novel exposure points, companies should establish or review safeguards designed to prevent misconduct and create defensible documentation of oversight.

Delaware Litigation

In the landmark In re McDonald’s Corp. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, the Delaware Court of Chancery dramatically extended executive civil legal exposure. The court held that corporate officers (not just board members) owe Caremark-style oversight duties within their respective spheres of responsibility.

For executives, the implications are significant. Failing to act on credible warning signs regarding compliance, workplace conduct, or operational risks can trigger personal derivative liability, even absent direct participation in wrongdoing.

Post-McDonald’s cases have begun applying this reasoning to a range of C-suite positions. For example, in July, the court in Hizkiyev & Barak v. Kaseya, Inc. cited McDonald’s Corp. in concluding that officers and key managerial employees owe the same fiduciary duties as directors.

The broadening of executive legal exposure likely will extend to jurisdictions beyond Delaware, particularly as aggressive plaintiffs’ firms test the boundaries of officer oversight obligations.

Federal Enforcement’s Focus

At the federal level, the Department of Justice continues to make individual accountability a central pillar of its enforcement strategy. This has remained as true during the Biden administration as is in the Trump administration.

For example, federal enforcement officials have linked individual accountability to incentives for self-reporting and cooperation. Biden-era DOJ leadership emphasized that companies seeking cooperation credit must identify all individuals involved in misconduct, regardless of position. They also warned that executives who obstructed or ignored internal warnings could face personal exposure even if their company ultimately avoided prosecution.

These policies have continued under the Trump administration. The June 9 Foreign Corrupt Practice Act guidelines put individual accountability at the center of the DOJ’s enforcement policy.

Similarly, the Criminal Division’s corporate enforcement and voluntary self-disclosure policy and guidance on coordinating corporate resolution penalties in parallel criminal, civil, regulatory, and administrative proceedings—citing Justice Manual 1-12.000—remain focused on holding accountable individuals who are considered most responsible for “corporate malfeasance.”

The Securities and Exchange Commission likewise continues to invoke Section 20(a) control-person liability and the books-and-records provisions to pursue CFOs, controllers, and compliance officers who “caused” inaccurate disclosures or internal control failures. This approach reflects the broader trend toward holding senior leaders responsible not just for what they knew, but for what they purportedly should have known.

Collectively, these developments mark a paradigm shift from corporate to personal culpability.

New Risk Areas

The emerging risk landscape extends beyond traditional financial controls. Enforcers, regulators, and private plaintiffs in the US, Europe, and elsewhere are increasingly targeting environmental, social, and governance disclosures; forced-labor compliance; and artificial intelligence governance as new areas where executives face personal legal exposure.

For example, false or overstated ESG commitments, whether in sustainability reports or SEC filings, can underpin securities fraud or consumer-protection claims. Executives responsible for ESG reporting or data-management programs could be held liable for misrepresentations or for failing to implement adequate oversight mechanisms.

Similarly, supply-chain transparency laws such as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act have created new obligations that can implicate officers when compliance systems are deficient.

AI-related risks follow the same trajectory. As companies deploy AI tools in decision-making, hiring, and risk assessment, regulators and enforcers are warning that executives can’t delegate accountability to algorithms.

In short, the scope of what constitutes “oversight” has broadened dramatically, requiring senior leaders to anticipate nontraditional risk domains previously viewed as peripheral to their fiduciary duties.

Practical Implications

To navigate this shifting environment, companies and their leadership teams should prioritize structural and procedural safeguards that both prevent misconduct and create defensible documentation of good-faith oversight. Key steps to consider include:

Clarify role definition. Delineate the responsibilities of operational, risk, and compliance executives to reduce role ambiguity and overlapping accountability.

Formalize governance protocols. Establish and document escalation procedures for compliance issues, ensuring that red flags are tracked and resolved at the appropriate managerial level.

Review directors-and-officers insurance coverage. Confirm that Side A/B/C policies extend to officer-level oversight and regulatory claims, and that indemnification provisions remain robust.

Preserve privilege during investigations. Coordinate with outside counsel to structure internal investigations in ways that protect attorney-client privilege while demonstrating diligence to stakeholders and ensuring the integrity of investigative findings.

Document training and oversight. Regularly train senior management on fiduciary and compliance obligations, maintaining contemporaneous records that evidence proactive oversight.

Companies should also reassess their executive onboarding and certification processes, ensuring that officers acknowledge their oversight duties and understand the personal consequences of noncompliance. A well-crafted governance memo or certification statement can help memorialize these expectations and support defense arguments in derivative or regulatory proceedings.

Outlook

The convergence of Delaware fiduciary duty expansion and intensified federal enforcement and regulatory oversight signals a new era of personal accountability, both civilly and criminally. The once-clear gap between entity level, board member, and individual executive liability is narrowing.

Emerging domains such as ESG, supply-chain transparency, and AI oversight have created novel exposure points that require cross-functional awareness. Effective oversight is no longer just good governance; it is personal risk mitigation. Demonstrating a credible, well-documented culture of compliance can mean the difference between defending a more diffuse corporate decision and defending oneself in court.

In this article, we examine the recent judgment of Mr. Justice Mould in the case of Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd [2025] EWHC 2937 (KB) , delivered on 13–15 October 2025. The case involved the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as accommodation for asylum seekers, and the refusal of the High Court to grant a final injunction under Section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA 1990) to prevent this use. We consider the legal issues raised in the judgment, including the application of Section 187B, the criteria for granting injunctions, the role of proportionality and public interest, the consideration of broader societal impacts, and the intervention of the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD).

Statement of Facts

The case concerned the use of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, as accommodation for asylum seekers. Epping Forest District Council sought a final injunction under Section 187B of the TCPA 1990 to prevent the use of the hotel for this purpose, alleging a breach of planning control. The High Court refused to grant the injunction, finding that enforcement through Section 187B was neither just nor proportionate in the circumstances. The court emphasised the public interest in maintaining asylum accommodation and the importance of fulfilling statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to prevent destitution among asylum seekers. The SSHD sought to intervene in the proceedings but was initially denied intervener status by the High Court. This decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal.

Law

Section 187B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990: This provision allows LPAs to apply for an injunction to restrain an actual or apprehended breach of planning control where it is deemed ‘necessary or expedient’. The court has discretion to grant such an injunction if it deems it appropriate for restraining the breach. However, LPAs are expected to consider conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief, as failure to do so may influence the court’s decision.

Criteria for granting injunctions: In Hillingdon LBC v Guinea Enterprises Ltd, the court outlined three key considerations for granting an injunction under Section 187B:

Whether there is an actual or apprehended breach of planning control;

Whether it is necessary or expedient to restrain such a breach by means of an injunction; and

Which defendants (if any) are the proper persons to be restrained.

Proportionality and public interest: The court must weigh the balance of convenience and assess whether the harm caused by the alleged breach of planning control is outweighed by the public interest. Injunctive relief under Section 187B should only be granted when it is necessary and proportionate.

Broader societal impacts: The court must consider the broader societal impacts of planning enforcement actions, including statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which aim to prevent destitution among asylum seekers.

Intervention by the SSHD: Under CPR 19.2(2), the court may grant permission for a party to intervene in proceedings if it is desirable to do so to resolve the issues in dispute. The Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of state for the Home Department (“SSHD”) had a pivotal constitutional role and could materially contribute to the judicial decision-making process through evidence and legal argument.

Analysis

The judgment in Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd provides significant guidance on the application of Section 187B of the TCPA 1990. The court’s refusal to grant the injunction was based on the principle that injunctive relief should only be granted when it is necessary and proportionate. While the court indicated that the council may have had a reasonable basis to allege a breach of planning control (whilst being critical of the exercise of delegated powers), the court found that the public interest in maintaining asylum accommodation outweighed the planning harm alleged. This aligns with the principle that LPAs should exhaust conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief.

The court’s decision also reflects the criteria established in Hillingdon LBC v Guinea Enterprises Ltd, particularly the need to assess whether an injunction is necessary or expedient to restrain the breach of planning control. In this case, the court determined that the balance of convenience did not favour granting the injunction, as the harm caused by the alleged breach was outweighed by the significant public interest in providing accommodation for asylum seekers.

The judgment further underscores the importance of considering broader societal impacts in planning enforcement actions. The Bell Hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was deemed critical to fulfilling statutory duties under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which include preventing destitution among asylum seekers. This public interest consideration was pivotal in the court’s decision to refuse the injunction.

Finally, the intervention of the SSHD in the proceedings highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant parties are given the opportunity to contribute to the judicial decision-making process. The Court of Appeal’s decision to overturn the High Court’s refusal to grant intervener status to the SSHD demonstrates the necessity of considering the constitutional role and potential contributions of intervening parties in cases with significant public interest implications.

Conclusion

The judgment in Epping Forest District Council v Somani Hotels Ltd provides a clear precedent for the application of Section 187B of the TCPA 1990, emphasising the importance of proportionality, public interest, and the exhaustion of conventional enforcement measures before seeking injunctive relief. The case also highlights the need to consider broader societal impacts and statutory duties in planning enforcement actions which had not been done in this case. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal’s decision regarding the SSHD’s intervention underscores the importance of allowing relevant parties to contribute to the resolution of disputes with significant public interest implications. This judgment serves as a reminder to LPAs to adopt a balanced approach to enforcement and to carefully consider the necessity and proportionality of seeking injunctive relief in planning control cases.",https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/images/LGL_Favicon_2025.png,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:17.167294

What does the law say?

Under U.S. immigration law, spouses of American citizens who entered the country lawfully are generally eligible to adjust status, even if their tourist/business visa has expired during the lengthy green-card process.

Despite the law's adjustments, ICE's explanation in many of these cases was “visa overstay.” No allegations of fraud or criminal behavior were cited, and many of those detained had already passed preliminary background and security checks.

According to KBPS, ICE said in a statement that it is dedicated to upholding immigration law while ignoring criticisms regarding the necessity of these green card arrests.

The immigration lawyers whose clients have been arrested are saying that the arrests represent “a drastic policy shift,” one that undermines decades of practice.

Advocates say these detentions undercut promises that serving in the military or being married to a citizen offers security or protection. ICE's current rampant arrests from the green-card interviews disregard humanitarian and moral obligations, especially for long-established families.

Lawsuits being filed

AP reported that a class-action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California on November 25, 2025. It challenges ICE’s detention of immigrants who showed up for routine check-ins or legal proceedings in San Diego.

The lawsuit argued that re-detaining people previously cleared for release, without new crimes or warnings, violates their constitutional due-process rights.

The lawsuit names petitioners who had complied with all prior hearings and court orders, had no criminal record, yet were taken into custody unexpectedly during ICE-scheduled check-ins.

Earlier in 2025, a similar lawsuit was filed against ICE for courthouse arrests in San Diego after agents detained asylum-seekers and other immigrants exiting immigration court, reportedly without giving them proper due process. That suit argues such arrests are “arbitrary” and undermine the integrity of the immigration legal process.

Their joint report, “’You Have Arrived in Hell’: Torture and Other Abuses Against Venezuelans in El Salvador’s Mega Prison,” describes how people who were apprehended or processed by US agencies were sent to El Salvador and placed in the maximum‑security Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT), where survivors and witnesses have reported systematic mistreatment, prolonged isolation, and conditions that the researchers concluded amounted to torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

The report explains that many of the transferred individuals had not been convicted of violent crimes and that the criteria used to identify alleged gang affiliation were unreliable and arbitrary. The report explains that an “Alien Enemy Validation Guide” and other screening tools were applied in ways that assign guilt by association — counting tattoos, clothing, gestures, or social‑media connections as indicia of membership. Experts and family members have described these measures as deeply flawed. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal argue that these procedures produced wrongful classifications and exposed people to foreseeable risks when they were handed over to Salvadoran authorities.

Inside CECOT, the report recounted repeated accounts of physical violence, humiliating treatment, and severe deprivation. Survivors told researchers that guards beat detainees on arrival and throughout their confinement; one detainee said, “They beat us almost every day.” Others described forced head shavings, prolonged solitary confinement in a segregated area known to detainees as “the Island,” and incidents of sexual violence and threats. The report quotes detainees who said that, upon being brought into the facility, officials told them, “You have arrived in hell.”

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal identified patterns of enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention. Families report that they were denied information about relatives’ whereabouts for extended periods; some relatives say they received no official confirmation of detention until months later. The organizations describe cases in which detainees were held without meaningful access to counsel, without consistent medical care, and with severely restricted contact with the outside world. The report emphasizes that secrecy and lack of transparency compounded the risk of abuse and make independent monitoring difficult.

The report examines the bilateral and programmatic context for the transfers. It describes US funding and cooperation with Salvadoran security agencies, noting a grant letter and other assistance that the authors say facilitates the operations. Human Rights Watch and Cristosal have also raised legal concerns about the transfers, arguing that sending people to El Salvador in circumstances where they faced a real risk of torture or ill‑treatment violated the principle of non‑refoulment under international law. The organizations have called for the suspension of any arrangements enabling transfers until independent safeguards and monitoring are in place.

Researchers have also scrutinized the legal authorities and administrative mechanisms used to justify the removals. The report points out that a mix of immigration procedures and emergency proclamations have been invoked, and it questions whether adequate legal review and oversight has occurred. The authors argue that the use of expedited or exceptional authorities without transparent safeguards has increased the risk that people could be wrongly designated as security threats and transferred without meaningful procedural protections.

Human Rights Watch and Cristosal documents the human consequences of those policies through detailed interviews with survivors, family members, lawyers, and medical professionals. The report describes physical injuries consistent with beatings, psychological trauma from prolonged isolation and threats, and the long‑term health impacts of inadequate medical care. It recounts the anguish of families who have been unable to locate loved ones and the frustration of lawyers who have faced obstacles in obtaining records or access to clients.

The organizations conclude that the pattern of transfers and the conditions of detention require urgent remedial action. They recommend that the United States immediately halt transfers of third‑country nationals to El Salvador due to the risk of torture or ill‑treatment; disclose any agreements or understandings governing transfers; condition assistance on verifiable human‑rights safeguards; and rescind emergency proclamations or other measures that circumvented normal legal protections.

On September 30, 2025, Frank Heindel, a freedom-of-information advocate, sued the University of South Carolina (“USC”) in the Fifth Judicial Circuit Court in Richland County, SC to obtain records pertaining to the school’s payments of more than $20,000,000 to student athletes. The lawsuit claims that the school violated the state’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and asks the judge to “either order USC to turn over the records in their entirety or hold a confidential hearing to determine which parts might be exempt from disclosure.”

Following landmark shifts in Name Image and Likeness and collegiate revenue sharing (a result of the House v. NCAA settlement), USC, along with most universities in the United States, have begun to explore the uncharted waters surrounding the disbursement of funds to student-athletes. Schools that opted into the settlement are permitted to utilize $20.5 million to pay their athletes and are subject to FOIA requests for information and records. However, USC has failed to produce responsive documents to FOIA requests for invoices from USC’s NIL Collective, The Garnet Trust. USC has claimed that the information being requested is not in their possession but rather in the possession of private actors and companies like the NIL Collective and Learfield – entities not beholden to the same FOIA laws as the school. On September 4, 2025, USC was sent a FOIA request from Frank Heindel, who is an open records advocate and has sued USC in the past for failing to respond to a previous FOIA request in 2019. Through his request, Heindel is seeking to obtain any “executed revenue-sharing contracts or agreements between the university and its football players.” The university subsequently denied the request, claiming that the information is shielded by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Heindel claims USC’s position is “legally untenable” and that when a public university spends tax dollars, their usage of funds should be disclosed. The plaintiff is seeking a court order directing USC to either produce the records or hold a hearing to determine which records are exempt from disclosure.

“I’m not asking for names or grade point averages. I’m asking how a public university spends public money,” said Heindel. The university’s legal representative, attorney Andrew Lindemann of Lindemann Law Firm, P.A. in Columbia, South Carolina, responded, saying the university “had lawfully and accurately responded to Heindel’s records request.” A hearing was set for October 10, 2025.

In late October, during the height of the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) subagency Food Nutrition Services (FNS) issued guidance interpreting the recently-passed omnibus legislation. That guidance purports to limit noncitizen access to SNAP benefits in several significant ways.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday by New York Attorney General Letitia James says the FNS guidance ""errs"" in how it interprets the new law.

At the heart of the litigation are the government's apparent efforts to keep certain categories of noncitizens who become green card holders from ever accessing SNAP benefits, the plaintiffs say.

The 28-page complaint offers a condensed history lesson:

Prior to the OBBB going into effect, non-citizens who entered the United States as refugees or were granted asylum were eligible for SNAP, based on their status at the time of their admission or parole. This was also true for many who were granted humanitarian parole. OBBB eliminated these categories of eligibility in the FNA. However, nothing in OBBB prohibits individuals who once held the status of refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees from gaining eligibility for SNAP if and when they adjust their status to lawful permanent residents (LPRs).

To hear the plaintiffs tell it, immigrants who came to the United States as refugees or asylum seekers ""can be eligible for SNAP benefits if they adjust status and become"" green card holders, but the Trump administration is trying to make sure such immigrants ""will never be eligible for SNAP benefits.""

""The Guidance creates a false dichotomy in describing categories of immigration statuses post-OBBB as either 'Not eligible unless an LPR' or 'Not eligible,'"" the lawsuit reads. ""Regardless of the status they once held, any non-citizen who adjusts to LPR status can become eligible for SNAP if they meet other statutory requirements. However, the Guidance incorrectly places many of these individuals in the 'Not eligible' category, rather than the 'Not eligible unless an LPR category'""

The plaintiffs say the government is ""misleadingly"" telling certain groups of immigrants they can never become eligible for SNAP benefits.

""In reality, irrespective of someone's immigration status before becoming an LPR, once they obtain their Green Card, they are eligible for SNAP if they meet other statutory requirements,"" the lawsuit goes on.

A secondary issue is the speed with which SNAP benefits can be conferred on certain non-citizens due to an ancillary law known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA).

Under PRWORA, green card holders are only eligible for SNAP benefits if they have lived in the country for at least five years or without the five-year waiting period if they fall into ""approximately a dozen"" enumerated categories — such as being blind, disabled, or a child, the lawsuit explains.

Now, however, the government says those exceptions to the waiting period no longer apply to certain classes of green card holders.

The plaintiffs reject this ""clear"" misreading of PRWORA, the lawsuit says.

""PRWORA excludes individuals who were admitted as refugees, granted asylum, had their deportation withheld, and others, from the five-year waiting period,"" the complaint continues. ""And no provision of the OBBB amended PRWORA's exemptions from its five-year waiting period.""

A tertiary issue identified by the plaintiffs is a new system to identify and account for errors envisioned by the FNS guidance.

That new system, the plaintiffs insist, ""would saddle states with catastrophic financial penalties unless they immediately implement the unlawful restrictions,"" according to a press release issued by James' office.

Under the OBBB, states have 120 days to process new guidance and root out violations, according to the lawsuit. Still, the Trump administration is trying to implement the FNS guidance with only one day of leeway for any such violations, the filing explains.

""The federal government's shameful quest to take food away from children and families continues,"" James said in a statement. ""USDA has no authority to arbitrarily cut entire groups of people out of the SNAP program, and no one should go hungry because of the circumstances of their arrival to this country. My office will always fight to protect Americans' SNAP benefits, and I will do everything in my power to shield New Yorkers from this unlawful policy.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Letitia-James-Donald-Trump.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 07:57:49.113535

MEXICAN NATIONAL DETAINED, HANDCUFFED DURING GREEN CARD INTERVIEW: US ATTORNEY Immigration attorney Tessa Cabrera told ABC 10 that her client, a Mexican national residing in the US since 2002, was handcuffed and taken into custody during his GreenCard interview.","US federal agencies are detaining people, including spouses of American citizens, during routine Green Card interviews at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices in San Diego, according to media reports in the US. An attorney claimed that his client was detained and handcuffed when he appeared for the Green Card interview.

Immigration attorney Saman Nasseri said the federal agencies have begun arresting visa overstays during their interviews. Some couples and their lawyers told The New York Times they had followed the required steps to secure permanent residency.

""ICE and USCIS have started implementing a policy where ICE is now making arrests at USCIS offices during the green card interviews on anyone who is a visa overstay, so if they're out of status, ICE is making that arrest at the interviews,"" Saman Nasseri was quoted as saying by CBS8.

Nasseri stated that five of his clients were taken into custody during Green Card interviews just last week. He said that his clients have no criminal history or arrests.

""None of my clients have any arrests or criminal history that are in this situation. These are just cases where they entered legally, they overstayed their visa. All of my cases right now are people that have been married to US citizens, so these are spouses of US citizens that are going through the normal process, the normal channels, and they're being taken into custody,"" Nasseri added.

Another attorney, Habib Hasbini, also confirmed similar experiences with his clients.

""The first one was November 12, the eve of the memo that came down from ICE. After that, I had four to follow through, but I've been getting a lot of phone calls from people who were arrested from the same facility,"" Hasbini told CBS8.

Attorney Habib Hasbini observed that, so far, these detentions seem to be confined to the USCIS office in San Diego.

Hasbini recommended that those with scheduled GreenCard interviews should still attend, while remaining cautious and prepared for potential detentions.

He suggests making family and work arrangements in case of detention, noting that not attending an interview can result in case denial for abandonment. Additionally, because individuals are out of status, they may still face arrest by ICE regardless, CBS8 reported.

MEXICAN NATIONAL DETAINED, HANDCUFFED DURING GREEN CARD INTERVIEW: US ATTORNEY

Immigration attorney Tessa Cabrera told ABC 10 that her client, a Mexican national residing in the US since 2002, was handcuffed and taken into custody during his GreenCard interview.

The man's US citizen daughter had applied for him to get permanent residency, according to the ABC10 report.

""The officer said, I'll be right back and stepped out. And then, two ICE officers walked in. They asked him what his name was and then put him in handcuffs,"" Cabrera said.

The client was taken to the basement of the federal building and was detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, according to Cabrera.

She said that ICE officers gave her a ""Warrant for Arrest"" issued by the Department of Homeland Security.

The warrant states they have probable cause based on statements made to the immigration officer or evidence that the person lacks immigration status or is removable under immigration law, according to the report.

ICE DEFENDS ARRESTS: WE ENFORCE THE LAW AT USCIS OFFICES TOO

An ICE spokesperson told CBS8 that the agency is ""focused on enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that emphasise national security, public safety, and border security.""

""Individuals unlawfully present in the United States, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal in accordance with US immigration law,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying by CBS8.

“It’s just happened,” Mr. Trump said.
“This is what we had under the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said, holding up the photograph of the frenzied evacuation scene for the news cameras in the room.
A reporter at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday asked Mr. Trump about this as well.
“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Mr. Trump answered.","The shooting of two National Guard members the day before in Washington hung over President Trump’s Thanksgiving events at Mar-a-Lago, where he held a call with members of the military to thank them for their service on the holiday.

At the beginning of the call, he revealed that one of the Guard members, Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, had died.

“It’s just happened,” Mr. Trump said. “She was savagely attacked. She’s dead. Not with us.” The other victim, he said, was “fighting for his life.”

Later, a White House official said that the president had spoken with the family of the slain National Guard member.

After authorities identified the suspect as an Afghan refugee, members of the Trump administration and other Republicans reacted furiously. They cited it as evidence of what they had been warning about immigration, condemned the Biden administration’s refugee policies and said it justified a further crackdown on immigration.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Thursday that in the wake of the attack, he was implementing new policy guidance on vetting prospective immigrants from 19 high-risk countries using “country-specific factors as significant negative factors.” The change in guidance had been under consideration before the shooting.

In his statement, Mr. Edlow blamed the Biden administration for “dismantling basic vetting and screening standards, prioritizing the rapid resettlement of aliens from high-risk countries over the safety of American citizens.”

The fierce rhetoric was echoed across the administration.

“I remember back in 2021 criticizing the Biden policy of opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,” Vice President JD Vance wrote on social media on Wednesday. “Friends sent me messages calling me a racist. It was a clarifying moment. They shouldn’t have been in our country.”

At Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, Mr. Trump produced a photograph showing Afghans rushing onto a plane leaving their country as its government collapsed in 2021.

“This is what we had under the Biden administration,” Mr. Trump said, holding up the photograph of the frenzied evacuation scene for the news cameras in the room. “That whole thing should have never, ever happened.”

When a reporter pointed out that, according to officials, the suspect had worked with the C.I.A. and therefore had been vetted, Mr. Trump said, “He went cuckoo, I mean, he went nuts.”

Mr. Trump said his administration was “looking at” the possibility of deporting the family of the 29-year-old suspect, who lived in Bellingham, Wash., with a wife and several children.

Asked whether he was blaming all Afghans for the crime of one man, Mr. Trump said, “No, but there’s a lot of problems with Afghans.”

Echoing largely unfounded claims that he has made about immigrants from other countries, he said that “many of these people are criminals, many of these people are people that shouldn’t be here.”

Jumping to the subject of Somali refugees in Minnesota, he said that population was “taking over” that state, bringing gang violence.

Asked what Somalis had to do with the Afghan suspect, Mr. Trump replied: “Ah, nothing, but Somalians have caused a lot of trouble, they’re ripping us off a lot of money.” This led him to criticize Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States as a refugee from Somalia.

“We’re not taking their people anymore,” he said.

In a pair of lengthy social media posts just before midnight on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and denaturalize migrants “who undermine domestic tranquillity.” He did not provide details about how he would go about it, or provide specific evidence about problems created by immigrants.

He again referred to gangs from Somalia in Minnesota, questioning Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota’s intelligence and his ability to handle the supposed threat, and mocked Ms. Omar for her use of a hijab.

Similar language has exploded on the right since Wednesday’s shooting, including from Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, who called for Muslim potential immigrants to be banned and for the deportation of anyone deemed an “Islamist.”

In the case of the shooting suspect, he received asylum from the U.S. government in April, according to three people with knowledge of the case who were not authorized to speak publicly. A reporter at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday asked Mr. Trump about this as well.

“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Mr. Trump answered. “No matter how you want to do it, it’s very hard to get them out, but we’re going to be getting them all out now.”

She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign.
Meanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue.","Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Mayor of New York City has had a volatile relationship with President Trump. He's called the president a fascist. Trump, in return, has called him a ""little communist mayor,"" and warned that he may send in the National Guard. The administration also said it will expand ICE operations in the city.

But when the two leaders finally met face to face recently it was, to many people's surprise, cordial. Some may even say warm.

""We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job,"" the president said. Soon the internet was flooded with memes of the president looking admiringly up at Mamdani. The next day's New York Post cover read ""I love you Mam.""

But many New Yorkers say they're taking it all with a grain of salt and remaining on guard.

""The president says one thing one day, and a different thing the next,"" says one street vendor outside the subway station in Queens. ""You don't know what's real anymore.""

What she does know is that she's seen an uptick in immigration enforcement recently, which is why she asked that NPR withhold her name. She's undocumented, and she's worried.

Every morning at around 4:30 a.m., she posts up here and sells refreshments and breakfast. A few weeks ago, a little after setting up, she says several ICE agents jumped out of an unmarked car in pursuit of two workers who'd just bought something to eat.

She ran into the building behind her, locked the door and hid in the stairway until it was all over.

This vendor says she loves Mamdani, but worries the president will punish the city for electing a democratic socialist. She fears New York will turn into Chicago or Los Angeles, two cities that have experienced large-scale immigration raids.

This is a common sentiment in New York these days. The day after the White House meeting, President Trump said that while he's not planning on sending troops into New York now, he would, if needed. NPR reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no response.

Mamdani, for his part, reiterated he will defend immigrants in New York.

His team did not grant NPR an interview, despite multiple requests. But a source close to his transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity told NPR that Mamdani is exploring legal strategies at the local level to limit Trump's actions in New York City, including muscling up the NYC Law Department by adding 200 attorneys.

Congressman Patrick Ryan of the Hudson Valley, a Democrat whose district includes some of New York City's northern suburbs, told NPR that one of the lessons from Chicago and LA is that states can successfully challenge the administration in court. Ryan cites his own background as an Iraq War veteran.

""To come home to my state and my country, and see the idea of U.S. troops deployed against U.S. citizens and American cities, it's so fundamentally un-American. It's also, by the way, not what young American men and women sign up to do,"" he says.

He hopes the meeting between Mamdani and Trump de-escalated tensions. But like the street vendor in Queens, he's taking it with a grain of salt. He's hoping for the best, he says, but preparing for the worst.

Which is what organizers on the streets are doing.

Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez is the deputy director of the advocacy group Street Vendor Project. She says street vendors are among the most vulnerable immigrants in New York. ""Street Vendors are the eyes on the ground right? They see everything that happens.""

She's hopeful that the incoming Mayor will be an ally. She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign. Many of them, she says, see this as ""the next pandemic.""

The organization is, in fact, leaning in on pandemic-era strategies for vendors who are scared to work on the streets during immigration raids. ""We have a catering program for example, where people can reach out to us, and we'll connect them to a vendor for catering their event.""

She says, something the new mayor could do is make it easier for street vendors to operate — which Mamdani has said he will prioritize. He has pledged to allow thousands of additional license applications for vendors, and repeal criminal liability rules.

Meanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue. She wonders how long this liveliness will last, and how long she will endure.

""Three more years,"" she says, referring to the Trump administration. ""I hope they go by quickly.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8382x4715+0+873/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Fdc%2Fc47f8c8e4af6b267b7caf28fa3bd%2Fgettyimages-2242335314.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 21:56:39.171952

It is important for you to know about these new powers, and to know your rights.

For now, the most important things you can do are:

Keep notes of what happened, if you are searched or your things are taken. This can even be voice notes on a phone, or the phone of a friend, that you can use later.

Write down on paper the phone numbers at the end of this guide. You can call these numbers for advice, if you are searched or your things are taken in detention.

Write down on paper other important info you keep in your phone, like passwords or the phone numbers of family and friends, in case your mobile phone is taken away.

What are the new powers?

Using their new powers, immigration officers and guards can:

Ban certain items;

Conduct searches for those items including:

Searches of your clothes, your possessions or your room;

Strip searches; and

Searches using dogs.

What items have been banned?

The Minister for Home Affairs can ban any items in immigration detention, if he thinks they pose a risk to the health or safety of people in detention, or to the good order of the detention centre.

So far, the following items have been banned:

Mobile phones

SIM cards

Devices that have the internet, including tablets and computers

Alcohol

It is possible that other items could end up being banned.

What happens to items that are banned?

Once an item is banned, immigration officers can:

Search you and your room for the item (without a warrant);

Seize the item (meaning take it from you).

This does not mean that all banned items will be automatically taken from you. You do not have to hand over your phone if officers have not asked for it.

But if you are searched and items are taken from you, then as soon as you can afterwards, you should tell a friend in detention about exactly what happened – or write down a note about what happened. This will be important when you speak to a lawyer later.

What happens if I am searched?

Under the new powers, immigration officers can search for weapons, documents (which might serve as evidence), and banned items, and take them from you.

The search powers are very broad. Immigration officers don’t need a warrant, and can search your clothing or room even if they don’t suspect that you have a weapon or a banned item.

Immigration officers can only conduct a strip search if they reasonably suspect that you have a weapon or a banned thing on you. They can’t ask you to take off more clothing, or search you for longer, than is necessary to find the thing they are looking for.

If you are strip-searched, please call one of the numbers below as soon as you can for advice.

What should I do if I have a banned item taken from me?

If you have a banned item taken from you, you should:

Ask for the reason the item has been taken from you;

Ask for the item to be returned to you;

If your medication has been taken, then tell them which doctor prescribed it and what you need it for;

If the officer doesn’t give it back, then ask why – they must have a reason to hold onto your property. Make a note of what they say; and

Call one of the numbers below to get advice.

What if my mobile phone or computer are taken from me?

People in detention have a right to communicate with their lawyers to get advice. Immigration officers can’t interfere with that right, by making it hard or impossible for you to communicate with your lawyer.

People in detention also have a right to communicate about political issues (like government policy or protests against detention). Communicating might mean talking on the phone or posting online about your political views. Officers can’t interfere with that communication without a good reason.

If officers take away your mobile phone or computer, they have to provide you with another way to contact your family and your lawyer.

If you have your computer or mobile phone taken from you, you should:

Immediately ask for your computer or phone to be returned to you.

If the officer doesn’t return the thing, then ask for reasons why – computers and mobile phones can only be taken from you if they pose a risk to people or the order of the detention facility, and officers must have a reason to hold onto your property. Make a note of what they say.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ORDERED DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH TO MOBILIZE 500 MORE NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO D-C IN THE WAKE OF THE SHOOTING.","The Trump administration says it won’t process immigration requests from Afghan nationals for the foreseeable future. The order comes after a gunman opened fire on two National Guard members in the busy streets of Washington, D.C., just blocks away from the White House, on Wednesday afternoon.

Authorities identified the shooter as 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal.

“This heinous assault was an act of evil, an act of hatred, and an act of terror,” President Donald Trump told the nation in an address Wednesday night. “It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.”

The West Virginia guard members — who were in Washington as part of the Trump administration’s takeover of the police department there — were taken to the hospital in critical condition. Investigators say it appears to have been a “targeted shooting.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post that Lakanwal was in the U.S. after being granted parole in 2021 under the Biden administration’s “Operation Allies Welcome” initiative. The initiative helped to safely relocate “vulnerable Afghans” and those who worked alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal from the country and subsequent Taliban takeover.

The federal government granted Lakanwal asylum earlier this year.

President Trump is now calling for a review of the immigration statuses of all Afghan migrants who were admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration.

“We’re not going to put up with these kinds of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn’t even be in our country,” he said. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”

Authorities shot the suspect before restraining him and taking him into custody. They said he was hospitalized but his injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.

Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to mobilize 500 more National Guard troops to D.C. following the shooting.

“This heinous assault was an act of evil and act of hatred and an act of terror. It was a crime against our entire nation. It was a crime against humanity.”

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ADDRESSING THE NATION AFTER A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE ON TWO NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN THE BUSY STREETS OF WASHINGTON, D-C — JUST BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

HELLO EVERYONE, I’M KARAH RUCKER — IN FOR CRAIG NIGRELLI TODAY.

NEW THIS MORNING — THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS WON’T BE PROCESSING IMMIGRATION REQUESTS FROM AFGHAN NATIONALS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE ORDER COMES AFTER A GUNMAN WAS IDENTIFIED AS AN AFGHAN NATIONAL.

THE WEST VIRGINIA GUARD MEMBERS — WHO WERE IN D-C AS PART OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S TAKEOVER OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THERE — WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL IN CRITICAL CONDITION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

INVESTIGATORS SAY IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A “TARGETED SHOOTING.”

THE SUSPECT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 29-YEAR-OLD RAHMANULLAH LAKANWAL.

HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM SAID IN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT LAKANWAL WAS IN THE U-S AFTER BEING GRANTED PAROLE IN 20-21 UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S “OPERATION ALLIES WELCOME” INITIATIVE TO RELOCATE “VULNERABLE AFGHANS” AND THOSE WHO WORKED ALONGSIDE U-S FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN SAFELY AFTER THE U-S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COUNTRY AND SUBSEQUENT TALIBAN TAKEOVER.

HE HAD BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM EARLIER THIS YEAR.

PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW CALLING FOR A REVIEW OF THE IMMIGRATION STATUSES OF *ALL* AFGHAN MIGRANTS WHO WERE ADMITTED TO THE U-S DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.

“We’re not going to put up with these kind of assaults on law and order by people who shouldn’t even be in our country. We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country. If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”

THE SUSPECTED WAS SHOT BY ANOTHER NATIONAL GUARD MEMBER AND TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

AUTHORITIES SAY HE’S IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

ICE detentions on track to double In the entirety of 2024, 1,185 were detained by ICE in Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties.","Northern Kentucky is on track to see more than double the number of ICE detainees this year over 2024.

Less than 2% of ICE detainees in Northern Kentucky have commited a violent crime.

Just over half of those detained face criminal charges.

In Northern Kentucky, less than 2% of people detained by ICE this year committed a violent crime. Of those who had criminal charges, nearly all of them were minor charges like traffic or drug offenses.

That's according to an Enquirer analysis of federal data for the three Northern Kentucky counties across the Ohio River from Cincinnati.

ICE detentions are on track to more than triple this year in Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties as President Trump's administration cracks down on immigration violations.

All three county jails have contracts to detain people on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The more immigrants detained, records show, the more money counties get from the federal government.

Boone County, for instance, made $4.5 million from its ICE contract last fiscal year.

In roughly the first seven months of 2025, the jails have made at least $5.2 million from daily ICE detention payouts.

But who are these detainees, where do they come from, and are they the “the worst of the worst” violent criminals Trump said would be targeted in immigration sweeps?

Here's what we know based on data from the University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, Berkeley's Deportation Data Project. The project collected information about ICE detainees in jails throughout the country.

The data includes detentions from Jan. 1 to July 28 this year.

How many detainees were charged with crimes in NKY?

About 752 people – roughly 54% – of ICE detainees in Northern Kentucky were charged with crimes when they were taken into custody.

Most of those crimes – about 17.5% – were traffic offenses, the data shows.

Fewer than 2% had committed violent crimes – aggravated assault, rape, or robbery – as categorized by the FBI.

The other 635 ICE detainees have not been charged with crimes, according to the most recent available data.

Most immigration violations are civil offenses, though entering the country illegally is a crime. About 2.5% of people faced charges for that.

In a previous email to The Enquirer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the media of peddling a ""FALSE narrative that ICE is not targeting criminal illegal aliens.""

""The official data tells the true story: 70% of ICE arrests were criminal illegal aliens with convictions or pending charges,"" she wrote in an email referencing national data.

Where do detainees come from?

Through July of this year, detainees in Northern Kentucky have reported citizenship in 59 countries.

Most were from Mexico and Guatemala. About 95% were male.

All of the 132 people deported from January to July were returned to the country where they had citizenship. The 103 who voluntarily left the country also returned to their country of citizenship, the data shows.

Some immigrants choose to voluntarily leave the United States as opposed to getting deported because it gives them a chance to legally enter the country later.

How long are they incarcerated?

The length of time people are held in the local jails varies wildly – from one day to more than 200.

But on average, people are in jail due to ICE detentions for roughly 43 days, based on available information.

ICE detentions on track to double

In the entirety of 2024, 1,185 were detained by ICE in Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties.

That number is on track to double in 2025 with 1,387 ICE detentions in the first roughly seven months of the year.

According to available data, about 51% of people detained in 2025 had been deported or left the country by the end of July.

Why the spike in detentions locally?

A combination of increased federal resources for ICE detentions and the agency's new contracts with local jails are behind the uptick.

Boone County Jailer Jason Maydak said the county has housed ICE detainees for roughly 20 years.

""We literally just hold them for ICE. They bring them to us. We don't go get them. We don't pick them off the streets,"" he told The Enquirer.

The Boone, Campbell and Kenton county jails both have intergovernmental agreements that permit them to house the detainees on behalf of ICE.

Campbell and Kenton counties, however, didn't sign their contracts until May 2024 and March 2025 respectively. But that's mostly a processing change.

In previous years, for instance, ICE already had access to see who was booked in the jails for local charges and could see whether inmates also had immigration violations. Then, when the person was released on their local charges, ICE would be notified and in turn request a 48-hour detainment of the person.

Within that time frame, an ICE agent or other correction officer would then transport the person to Boone or Grayson counties.

The new contracts permit the county to house the inmates rather than having to transport them.

The change, Kenton County Jailer Marc Fields said, was prompted due to ICE. He said the organization reached out to the jail about changing their contract.

The jail agreed, primarily, because of money – the federal government pays local jails $88 per day to house the inmates and reimburses local jails for medical expenses, one of the jail's highest expenses.

Meanwhile, in addition to housing county inmates, the jail had also been holding hundreds of inmates for the state and was only reimbursed $35 per day.

""We kind of looked at it as our beds being a commodity for the county and … what is the best use of those not only for our residents but for our taxpayers?"" Fields said.

Kenton County expands cooperation with ICE

Kenton County Detention Center is the only local jail that's beefed up its cooperation with ICE, including a Jail Enforcement Memorandum and a Warrant Service Officer Program agreement, which were both signed March 28.

The officer program allows corrections officers to issue ICE administrative arrest warrants within the jail. The memorandum allows for the creation of at least one ICE-trained designated immigration officer at the Kenton County Dention Center who would act as a go-between between ICE officers and detainees.

The county plans to have two of the specially trained officers, though the two programs haven't kicked into gear yet because ICE hasn't hosted training sessions in the area yet.

Fields also echoed Maydak's sentiments about why the jail is seeing so many ICE detainees.

""It's totally enforcement on their side,"" he said.

Nasseri reported that five of his clients were detained last week. None of them had criminal records or prior arrests. All were spouses of US citizens going through the standard green card process. “None of my clients have any arrests or criminal history. These are just cases where they entered legally and overstayed their visa, all of my cases right now are people that have been married to US citizens, so these are spouses of US citizens that are going through the normal process, the normal channels, and they're being taken into custody,"" Nasseri said. Immigration attorney Habib Hasbini confirmed similar cases. He said the detentions appear limited to the San Diego USCIS office. ""The first one was November 12, the eve of the memo that came down from ICE. After that, I had four to follow through, but I've been getting a lot of phone calls from people who were arrested from the same facility,"" Hasbini said. ""I have relationships with many attorneys working in many other counties; this is not happening for their clients in their vicinity, or it's only happening in San Diego,"" Hasbini added. Hasbini advised those with upcoming green card interviews to attend, but to plan for the possibility of detention, as missing an interview can result in case denial for abandonment.

Navy wife detained by ICE during green card interview

Arrests in front of families Reports from The Mirror describe ICE agents entering green card interview rooms in San Diego and arresting at least two immigrants in front of their American spouses and a six-month-old infant. The incidents occurred days after the November 12 start of similar arrests. In one case, Audrey Hestmark, the American wife of German national Tom Bilger, described three masked ICE agents handcuffing her husband and showing a QR code instead of identification, reported CTN. In another, Stephen Paul witnessed ICE arrest his British wife, Katie. The couple had decided to remain in the United States for her high-risk pregnancy.What ICE says An ICE spokesperson told CBS 8 that the agency is “committed to enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that prioritise national security, public safety, and border security.” The statement noted that individuals unlawfully present in the US, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal under US immigration law. ICE also said self-deportation remains the safest and most efficient option for those living illegally in the country. Tools like the CBP Home app are available to assist individuals with the process.Impact on migrant communities Immigration attorneys say arrests during green card interviews are unprecedented and may deter individuals from attending appointments, even when they are legally eligible for adjustment of status, reported The Mirror. Families face immediate impacts, including separation from spouses or children and uncertainty about the outcome of their immigration cases. As Stephen Paul said, “We had done everything they asked us to do. We were told it was the right procedure. And despite all that, they arrested her.”

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter joined Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson this month in a federal lawsuit over millions of dollars in police hiring grants that could be withheld by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, otherwise known as the COPS program. To access COPS money, the DOJ has insisted that cities certify they do not operate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and they will cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

That isn’t St. Paul’s only legal battle with the White House.

In another recent skirmish, Minnesota’s capital city had been counting on more than $560,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand Evie — a network of electric vehicle charging stations aimed at boosting car-sharing — into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods on the city’s East Side. In October, word came that the funding had been eliminated, alongside more than $7.5 billion in grants for clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which were states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“The Trump administration’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in climate grants targeted communities based solely on politics,” said Jennifer Lor, a spokesperson for Carter’s office. “In St. Paul, this decision cut the remaining funds from our $560,844 subgrant, slowing our groundbreaking work to expand clean, affordable, and reliable electric car-share options across the city’s East Side.”

Growing legal actions by city

The loss of energy-related grants forms the basis of yet another new federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, the latest in a growing number of legal actions filed by St. Paul and other municipalities and nonprofits alleging constitutional violations and federal overreach.

It’s been a busy year for St. Paul City Attorney Lyndsey Olson and her legal team, who have represented the city in at least five major legal battles with the Trump administration while trying to protect upwards of $200 million in federal funding that could be withheld from the city’s housing, public safety, clean energy and transportation initiatives.

The White House has derided so-called “woke” policies, including St. Paul’s 2004 separation ordinance, which prohibits city employees from asking residents their immigration status before delivering city services. In response, “blue” cities have accused the Trump administration of blatant political retaliation for not stepping into line with the president’s executive orders, including bans on language around diversity, equity and inclusion outreach, or “DEI.”

“We’re certainly being targeted and punished,” said Olson on Tuesday. “Our residents are being punished. Taxpayers are being punished in ways that are political and don’t have anything to do with the grants. The courts say this is not legal … and they keep doing it.”

St. Paul has company. Chicago has filed upwards of 40 legal actions against federal agencies, accusing them of playing politics with vital grant funding. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its own legal action against St. Paul and other “blue” cities that don’t fall into step with its immigration policies, though the lawsuit was not served on the city until late November, Olson said.

With a new mayoral administration coming in following the election this month of Mayor-elect Kaohly Her over Mayor Melvin Carter, Olson said she expects to be leaving City Hall around January, as most St. Paul mayors handpick their chief attorney. She said she anticipates whomever holds her position in the months ahead to face similar battles with the White House, and Her has made no secret of her disdain for the president’s approach toward immigration enforcement.

“It’s not just the filing of the lawsuits and the litigation piece,” Olson said. “It’s tracking everything they’re doing all the time. … They’ll put new terms into grant agreements that are already in process. They’ll say ‘we’re going to withhold money until you agree to these terms.’ I think that’s our new normal for the remainder of this (presidential) administration. I think blue cities are being targeted.”

Here’s a look at six lawsuits involving St. Paul and the Trump administration:

San Francisco v. Trump

In February, St. Paul signed onto a lawsuit, led by the city of San Francisco, accusing the Trump administration of attempting to commandeer city services by denying federal funding to municipalities that don’t fall in line with its executive orders and immigration policies. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, alleges that the White House is violating the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states.

In a written posting to its website, the White House that week called out the St. Paul mayor by name, as well as other city leaders in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for immigrant-friendly policies that the president claimed protected “killers, rapists and drug dealers.” St. Paul has maintained a “separation ordinance” that bars city employees from asking residents about their immigration status while delivering core city services.

Olson said her team has “argued forcefully that St. Paul’s ordinance, in place since 2004, does not inhibit lawful federal immigration enforcement but appropriately delineates municipal roles under the 10th Amendment.”

The federal district court issued preliminary relief, and the case is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Fresno v. Turner

In August, St. Paul joined a coalition of cities and counties in a federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration for allegedly punishing them by withholding or threatening to withhold $262 million in federal funding grants, including Community Development Block Grants, transportation funding and housing support.

The federal department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, had called on the cities to remove all references to “equity,” transgender rights and “environmental justice” in their grant work. Led by Fresno, Calif., the 10 jurisdictions filed their legal action in the Northern District Court of California, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

St. Paul joined the lawsuit after HUD and other federal agencies threatened to freeze or rescind more than $197.3 million already under contract, and jeopardized an additional $64.9 million in awarded funding “all to force compliance with a political agenda unrelated to the grant programs Congress authorized,” Olson said. “Had the administration succeeded, St. Paul would have faced catastrophic delays in housing development, emergency response projects, youth employment programs, and major infrastructure work such as the Kellogg Bridge replacement. A preliminary injunction protected these critical investments.”

Chicago v. Noem

In October, St. Paul joined Minneapolis, Ramsey County, Chicago, Denver, Boston and other jurisdictions in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly placing “unlawful and unrelated conditions” on more than $100 million in public safety and disaster grants. Olson said the “high-stakes suit” attempts to block “sweeping federal control of local policy.”

Chicago v. Noem, which was filed in federal district court in Illinois, alleges the White House is attempting to force cities and counties to police speech around diversity, equity or inclusion in violation of First Amendment and 10th Amendment rights, which include constitutional arguments around the separation of state and federal powers.

St. Paul alone is at risk of losing $4 million in pending or awarded funds, including funding covering about half the staffing in the city’s nine-person Emergency Management department. Olson said her legal team “emphasized that these conditions were wholly unrelated to the purpose of emergency-preparedness grants” and the lawsuit is intended to protect counterterrorism preparedness, port security, hazard-mitigation projects “and the city’s ability to respond to emergencies without political interference.”

United States v. State of Minnesota

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed legal action against the state of Minnesota, the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Hennepin County and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office over so-called “sanctuary city” policies that it alleges interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

The federal lawsuit followed similar legal action against Boston, New York City, Colorado and other jurisdictions that have prohibited local law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, including holding jail inmates past their scheduled release date so immigration authorities can determine if they’re wanted on federal immigration warrants. The lawsuit was served on St. Paul about a week ago, Olson said.

St. Paul v. Department of Energy, and Office of Management and Budget

St. Paul signed onto a federal lawsuit this month accusing the Trump administration of abruptly reneging on $7.56 billion in grant funding for 321 clean energy projects — including the city’s Evie car-charging stations — based on the political leanings of the 16 states they’re based in.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Environmental Defense Fund and four other environmental and energy-oriented advocacy groups, alleges constitutional violations of the First and Fifth amendments, which protect the freedom of speech and due process rights.

Chicago v. DOJ

St. Paul and Chicago filed legal action this month to prevent the Department of Justice from imposing sweeping new conditions on grants supporting the federally-backed COPS hiring program, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion-related initiatives, compelled compliance with all executive orders and forced cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed this month in U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois.

“The case challenged unconstitutional conditions that directly conflicted with St. Paul’s separation ordinance and threatened vital community-policing initiatives, including the city’s Downtown Homelessness Initiative,” Olson said.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-jea-21-PROTEST-0405.jpg?w=1024&h=657,N,,2025-11-27 22:56:26.458972

Both Oregon State Police and State Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, told KGW there are no known plans for ICE or other federal agents to conduct these operations.

Ruiz said he has been working for weeks to counter misinformation about immigration activity in his district, especially because there are verified enforcement missions and detainments reported to his office daily.

“We’ve seen kind of a steady operation of ICE agents being around our area. There’s no question that they’re here,” Ruiz said. “These are really tough times, very difficult times. But it is really important to verify with confirmed organizations that are doing this work on the ground.”

The roadblock rumor, alleging agents were preparing checkpoints on Interstate 5, Highway 26 and Interstate 84 spread quickly over the last couple of days. Ruiz said there is no verified information supporting those claims.

“There hasn’t been and there continues to be no verified or confirmed information regarding that,” he said. “If there were something like this to happen, someone within the state, the city or the county would know about this. And right now, there’s no indication of anything like this happening.”

Ruiz also took to his own social media accounts to urge residents to avoid spreading unverified posts that can fuel fear.

It’s hard, as they’re not the ones causing climate change, yet they’re the first to suffer from it.","Two years ago, a group of activists known as Scientist Rebellion blocked road and river traffic in Le Havre, Northern France, to oppose a new floating liquefied natural gas terminal.

Some activists locked themselves to the barriers on either side of the road, while others glued themselves to the asphalt. Police arrested them a few hours later and placed them in pre-charge detention for 24 hours.

Libre* is one of the 16 activists who took part in the protest. Each activist received a €200 criminal fine for blocking traffic, however they all chose to oppose and stood trial before the Havre First Instance Court, stating their acts were protected by freedom of expression. Two years later, on 10 February 2025, the Court acquitted the activists.

Libre’s case features in a new briefing developed by Amnesty International, APCOF and Suaram together with the Campaign to Decriminalize Poverty, Status and Activism “Dissent on Trial: Strategies to Counter Rising Criminalization of Activism”, which shares strategies activists, lawyers and civil society organizations can pursue to challenge the criminalization of various forms of activism including civil disobedience.

In this story, Libre reveals what inspired her activism, and why she’s hoping her engagement will lead to changes.

*Name has been changed to for security purposes

I’ve been aware of the effects of climate change since I was young. My parents used to find little notes I’d written such as “be careful with water” or “watch your waste”. It was a gradual journey, where I started taking small actions at home such as making posters for my parents, before trying to implement eco-friendly ideas in my classroom.

After that, I joined youth climate marches and organized scout projects, where we would pick up trash on beaches. However, I started to realise that youth climate marches weren’t as effective as I’d hoped, so I decided to turn to civil disobedience, hoping it makes a difference.

As part of Extinction Rebellion, I currently campaign on climate and environmental issues, taking on companies responsible for the climate and social crisis harming people, whose lives and lands they exploit.

The dangers of repression

I have faced dangers for taking part in these actions. While I was protesting against a giant water reservoir in south-western France, it turned extremely violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life. Police were shooting at us with rubber bullets and tear gas was being thrown into the crowds. I’ve also been kettled several times, deprived of access to water or toilets, as well as held in custody, which had a huge psychological impact on me.

Police were shooting at us with rubber bullets and tear gas was being thrown into the crowds

Libre, activist

In many ways, it’s nothing compared to the dangers others face due to climate change and I’m lucky I haven’t yet faced a real threat to my life because of climate disruption. However, when your life is put in danger because of activism, it’s still significant.

Repression is having a huge effect on me and my family. When my home was raided by mistake in connection to another case, my little sister was there. When I’m held in custody or go to court, my parents and partner come, so it’s stressful for them too. I’ve suffered nightmares. There are also legal consequences — for example, if I get a record, I can’t work anymore. I also miss workdays for trials, actions, and time in custody. It has affected my ability to travel. The last time I tried to go to England on the Eurostar, I was stopped at the border and questioned. They asked for my papers and why I was going there, because I think I’m flagged — maybe even as a “S file” (a security watchlist).

Climate change and its consequences

Sometimes, I feel like I am in a constant state of stress about the cause itself — climate change and its consequences — because I see that despite everything we do, very little changes.

Personally, I haven’t yet experienced the direct impacts of climate change, at least nothing beyond heatwaves. But I’ve witnessed small things.

For example, I think my grandparents’ house is collapsing due to global warming, especially because of soil issues. I also have a friend in Madagascar, who has experienced massive cyclones. It’s hard, as they’re not the ones causing climate change, yet they’re the first to suffer from it.

What we’re doing is for everyone

I wish authorities would realize that we’re not against them. We’re also doing it for them. We don’t want their children to suffer from climate change. It doesn’t bring us money or any personal benefit. It’s not for personal gain — it’s for all living beings. Everyone has a stake in this. By silencing the scientists and stopping us from taking action, authorities are putting themselves on the wrong side of history.

I wish authorities would realize that we’re not against them. We’re also doing it for them.

Libre, activist

We show our humanity when we’re able to see each other as equals, with respect and kindness for everyone, and when we act knowing that what we do has a positive impact on humanity and on all living beings.

My commitment is having an impact

Despite everything, I try and remain hopeful – especially when we manage to carry out actions that make sense, that speak to people. I also remind myself that small initiatives are taking place everywhere. And I tell myself that even if we don’t succeed, at least I’ll have done my part. I’ll be able to say to my children, and myself, I did what I could. That’s what keeps me going.

I know my work is having an impact. I’ve already had an impact on my loved ones by helping them understand the situation, as well as realize what state our rule of law is really in. Through the harsh repression we face as activists, my friends and family can see what that says about our democracy.

Then there’s the impact of our actions. Perhaps it feels small compared to what they cost us, but there is impact. We’ve seen results. And our actions make people think or at least force them to ask themselves questions. To me, that’s what matters.",https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/313106-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 20:57:26.366352

The mother spoke quietly about work drying up and more neighbors “laying low” as rumors of ICE sightings swept through the area.
Where once the community was predominantly Black, Latino residents now form the majority.
In June, a viral moment spread across the internet after Latino protesters hurled racial insults at a Black L.A. police officer.","This story is part of ICE vs. LA, a collaborative reporting project by LA Public Press, Caló News, Capital & Main, Capital B, LA Taco, and Q Voice.

Four months after nearly 5,000 federal troops descended onto Los Angeles, Marsha Mitchell, a Black organizer in South Central, explained what made it impossible for her not to act: her neighbors.

At the peak of the federal immigration raids this summer — when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was arresting an average of 540 people per week in the city — her neighbor, Erica, and her husband and friend were taken by federal agents while eating breakfast in their home.

All three were placed in a van and driven toward downtown Los Angeles.

But Erica knew she had to get back to her small children, recalled Mitchell, a lifelong South Central resident, from a conversation she had with her neighbor.

“As a mother, her whole thing was, I got to get to my babies,” Mitchell said.

When the agents opened the van doors in downtown L.A., Erica broke free — still tied up, still terrified — and ran. While Erica managed to escape, her husband was placed in the detention center, where he said conditions were unbearable. According to Mitchell, he self-deported rather than endure them, choosing to escape the system that had trapped him.

Erica was the family’s breadwinner through her tamale stand, but with her husband gone, she is too afraid to leave her home. The family has collapsed financially under the weight of a single raid, Mitchell said.

“Not only has she lost her business, but also her husband and the ability to give her family what they need to survive,” said Mitchell, an organizer with Community Coalition, the long-standing anti-violence and drug addiction group founded by now-Mayor Karen Bass in 1990.

In South L.A., where Los Angeles City Council Districts 8, 9, and 10 have transformed from predominantly Black to predominantly Latino, and where the highest percentages of undocumented residents in the city now live, Erica’s story is part of the new normal.

For some South Central residents, the raids have triggered economic and social catastrophes. During the first weeks of concentrated immigration enforcement, 465,000 fewer workers reported for work. One local business owner told the economic justice group Strategic Actions for a Just Economy that he’d lost 80% of his business in the first month of the ICE crackdown. Other shops across South Central and downtown lost business for weeks.

The raids are posing a new hurdle for Black and Latino families to pay rent in one of America’s most expensive cities. But they’ve also catalyzed Black neighbors to act.

“[Erica] is a member of our community, and she is afraid to come outside,” Mitchell said. “She is not alone, and that is why we’re helping with mutual aid.”

Immediately, that looked like bringing her family groceries and referring them to resources for free mental health care.

Community Coalition, known as CoCo, is training dozens of block captains to canvass their communities and coordinate food drop-offs, safety check-ins, and care referrals in real time. They’re organizing their neighbors around the threats facing everyone, regardless of their race or residency status.

The immediacy of this care network — 18 block captains now, with hopes to reach 28 — emerged after Erica’s abduction by ICE, according to Mitchell, who works for CoCo.

L.A. County’s Black residents — 20% of whom are immigrants or children of immigrants — are standing in solidarity with their Latino neighbors, saying they are part of a shared fight against over-policing and racialized violence. Nine out of 10 ICE arrests have been of Latinos.

“Seeing families torn apart is so reminiscent of the white supremacist playbook that we’ve seen historically in communities of color, and that starts with our Indigenous siblings to slavery and through these latest ICE raids,” Mitchell said.

Neighbors moved to action

On a quiet stretch of 92nd Street, Pamela Riley propped open her front gate around 8 a.m. For one Saturday in October, her front yard — one of the typical South Central flair caged in by a sagging iron gate — became the heartbeat of a block fighting back against abandonment.

Within minutes, her neighbors began to gather. Grandmothers sipped coffee, young mothers munched on donuts, and teenagers organized flyers printed in Spanish and English.

Just steps from the 110 freeway and the ghostly remains of shuttered shops and clinics, her community is forging new lines of solidarity amid chronic neglect and a deep need for connection. This is the new frontline in South Los Angeles, where a coalition of Black and Latino residents is launching a network of “Neighborhood Action Hubs” along the Vermont and Broadway corridors to keep mutual aid alive as official support shrinks.

The goal: to weave a grassroots shield against ICE crackdowns and social services cuts and offer a model for how neighbors, not institutions, can bridge fear and isolation.

“That blueprint of success is there. The road is paved, we just need to walk it together,” said Riley, a 64-year-old lifelong South Central resident.

Later that morning, as the sun tried to fight through the gloomy sky, a group of three of the women who showed up at Riley’s event — two Black, one Latina — passed the same mural-painted utility boxes and chain-link fences that mark so many South L.A. blocks. Old-school Chevys, some missing hubcaps, were parked next to pickups and battered minivans, while the sound of cumbia drifted from a doorway where a woman watered her agave under the music’s sway.

As they moved from house to house, the group stopped at gates and asked neighbors about the specific issues facing their blocks and individual households. At one, a longtime Latino immigrant, gray-haired and smiling, shared how she planned to vote in the now-passed November election.

Deeper onto the block, the canvassers encountered two undocumented migrants — one a young father, the other a middle-aged woman. The father spoke to tangible issues in the neighborhood: “People have started stealing car tires at night and cutting wires from light poles for quick money,” he said.

The mother spoke quietly about work drying up and more neighbors “laying low” as rumors of ICE sightings swept through the area. The Latina canvasser asked directly about food access and whether anyone still sold homemade snacks. The woman hesitated, then explained in Spanish that she stopped selling crepes out of fear.

The canvassers turned to the others and suggested a solution: organizing a block-wide food vendor party, so people could sell their products safely.

Walking farther, they found themselves cautiously welcomed by a Black city worker who had lived on the block for decades. She described losing sleep as the city’s racial demographics shifted and her worry about Black and Latino votes being split or erased.

At each stop, the canvassers handed out cards with voting information and explained how to register, where to find drop boxes, and how to access rapid response teams if ICE was spotted or the lights went out again.

“Solidarity is literally in L.A.’s DNA,” Mitchell said. “We know that when communities come together, we weather all kinds of storms — governmental, financial, whatever comes our way.”

L.A.’s long-history of racial coalitions

Riley said her memories are filled with better days: bustling shops, a hospital on 94th, neighbors who’d send their kids to college together. She has watched her neighborhood swing from prosperity to depression and now, uncertainty.

Today, Riley’s yard and days are devoted to strategizing — she and other block captains count names, rehearse response plans and dream of new “welcome to South Central L.A.” signs at every corner. During meetings, they talk about how, in other parts of the city, neighbors stand by each other in crisis; here, too, unity could mean survival. The terror of recent abductions — a beloved tamalera torn from her routine and dayworkers swiped off the streets — still haunts these blocks, sharpening every knock at the door.

“I grew up in a civil rights era of the ’60s, and I’m starting to realize this is the new era of civil rights,” Riley said, explaining that the attack on civil rights today has extended far beyond immigration raids. “It is requiring more from all of us.”

Having lived through what she considers broken promises following the devastation of the 1992 L.A. Riots, Riley said she understands that revival cannot rely on state intervention alone, and it bridges racial divides. Instead, she insists, “what’s going on in Washington DC is showing us we need to join together and support each other.”

It also reminds her of the power of community. During the 1992 protests against police brutality, Latinos constituted the largest portion of arrests despite making up a smaller percentage of the overall population at the time.

The roots of Black and Latino collaboration go back to the founding of L.A. itself, where 26 of the city’s 44 original settlers in 1781 were Black/Afro-Latino with Spanish surnames — establishing a tradition of mixed neighborhoods and joint political action. This foundation was later strengthened during the Great Migration and again throughout the 20th century, when Black and Latino residents forged working alliances in the face of shared exclusion from citywide power.

In recent decades, the demographic mix in South Central has shifted further. Where once the community was predominantly Black, Latino residents now form the majority. The change created new opportunities for solidarity, as well as challenges, especially after Latino L.A. City Council members were caught on tape using racist anti-Black language while discussing concerns about the political power of Black residents. The tapes reopened wounds over neighborhood displacement.

Today, the skepticism remains real for a lot of Black people in L.A. In June, a viral moment spread across the internet after Latino protesters hurled racial insults at a Black L.A. police officer.

“A significant number of Black folks don’t see this as their fight,” author and commentator Earl Ofari Hutchinson said after the protest in June. “They’ve seen anti-Blackness in Latino communities. They’ve felt left out when it came to our issues. That breeds skepticism.”

But “if anything, the debate over whether Blacks should link hands with Latino activists in the immigration battle seems age old,” Hutchinson wrote on his daily blog.

Hector Sanchez, CoCo’s Deputy Political Director, agreed.“It takes a lot of work. I’m not going to say it’s very easy … but it’s people that are willing to have those difficult conversations at times to ensure that we have each other’s back.”

Just a day after the city council tapes leaked, more than 400 people came together in Boyle Heights “to talk about the importance of multi-racial solidarity,” he said. Despite the tensions, neighbors continue fighting side by side for justice and belonging.

In the years since, organizers have responded by promoting cross-cultural events, joint canvassing efforts, and language exchange programs. Language exchange workshops and “know your rights” sessions — alongside mutual aid deliveries — have become linchpins of the hub approach.

“We are not just helping Black folks, not just one population. It’s for all of us,” explained Sequarier McCoy, a 49-year-old lifelong L.A. resident.

“I grew up in a Black and Brown community,” she added. “I smelled Black-eyed peas, but I also smelled tortillas. I like corn on the cob and Esquites.”

McCoy is also acutely aware that the issues of migration, detention and deportation are far from just Latino issues. “It’s also for Dominican folks. It’s also for Belizean folks. It’s also for Caribbean folks,” she said. She said her partner, a Belizean migrant, is living in fear too.

Black undocumented migrants are deported at a rate four times more often than their numbers would suggest, according to an analysis of federal data by the Black Alliance for Just Immigration.

It is why this practical solidarity spans crises, organizers said. When SNAP benefits run dry, when an ICE van is spotted, or when a neighbor’s lights go out, the same phone trees and rapid response plans kick in.

“This work is an honor as a human being, not just as an activist,” McCoy said.

Botox has become increasingly popular with people in their 20s seeking to stave off wrinkles.

Clinics market what is known as ""Baby Botox,"" lower dose treatments administered less frequently than those for midlife adults — perhaps only once or twice a year.

Patients share the process in online videos filmed from injectors' offices, asking for a touch up to blur away any hint of crows feet or 11 lines between the brows.

It may seem absurd that anyone so young would be worried about aging. But like putting on sunscreen, patients say their use of Botox is preventive.

Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A, an injectable neurotoxin derived from the bacterium that causes botulism. Other brand names include Dysport, Xeomin and Jeuveau. When administered in small amounts, the treatments block the nerve signals to the muscle causing it to relax, thereby temporarily reducing the appearance of wrinkles.

Attorney Stephanie Moore started getting Dysport when she was 27 to slow the formation of wrinkles around her eyes, which she attributes to her expressive face.

She pays about $460 per visit, and says these thrice-yearly injections are one of her favorite ways to treat herself: ""I feel a lot more confident.""

With Baby Botox, is age just a number?

There aren't comprehensive stats on what age groups are getting Botox, but data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons shows that between 2019 and 2022, the use of injectable neurotoxins grew by more than 70% across all age groups under 70, including Gen Z adults.

It is not approved for use in minors, so the youngest someone can get Botox is 18.

Demand for other types of aesthetic procedures and surgeries, including cheek implants and fillers, has also jumped since the COVID-19 pandemic.

This timing is no coincidence says sociologist Dana Berkowitz, author of the book Botox Nation: Changing The Face of America.

During the pandemic, people's lives migrated to virtual spaces. That included younger people who had this experience at a formative age. They attended high school or college on Zoom during the day, and then logged onto TikTok and Instagram for socialization in the evenings.

Berkowitz says by looking at curated images of others far more frequently, inevitably, people were comparing those faces to their own.

At the same time, Berkowitz says some celebrities, along with social media influencers, now openly earn income through endorsements of various cosmetic procedures, further normalizing it.

While the 20s seem young for Botox, Dr. Kristy Hamilton, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Houston, says young adults can start to show signs of aging — a lot of it comes down to genetics and sunscreen.

""Sometimes we see people in their mid-20s that have a lot of wrinkles, and that's just life,"" she says.

But what's wrong with having wrinkles?

Ageless beauty is seen as a ""status symbol"" in today's society, says Berkowitz. Young women she researched told her these treatments show they were able to invest in themselves at a very early age: ""It was like they were part of this elite kind of social club.""

As Berkowitz explores in her book, falling short of society's definition of feminine beauty can incur a professional tax. ""Our ideal femininity is a youthful one,"" she says.

Research shows that people who are perceived as beautiful get better treatment, says David B. Sarwer, who studies the psychological aspects of appearance and cosmetic procedures at Temple University's College of Public Health.

Sarwer points to a robust body of literature on how attractiveness can positively influence one's academic performance, professional advancement and legal outcomes. One study even found that newborns who are seen as more attractive by hospital nursing staff get picked up more frequently.

""It may make some, dare I say, strategic sense for people to say, 'I want to find a way to improve the way that I look,'"" he says.

Are there any risks to starting young?

Botox was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use in 2002. Physicians interviewed for this story note that since then millions have gotten it safely.

Reports of dangerous side effects are extremely rare, and typically linked to counterfeit or mishandled Botox.

There are still some risks. For one, it can stop working because your body forms a resistance to it.

This can be frustrating for patients, says Dr. Paul Durand, a Miami-based board-certified plastic surgeon. He hasn't seen any research explaining why this happens, but theorizes that younger people might be at higher risk because of their more robust immune systems.

Another concern is that too much Botox at too high a dose over time can cause excessive atrophy, or shrinking of the muscles. Since we lose volume in our faces as we age anyway, a person's face can start to look hollow instead of youthful.

Durand says well-trained clinicians can avoid that result by not overdoing it, i.e. not injecting too deep or using too much of the drug. But assessing a clinician's skill level may be difficult for patients.

Any medical doctor, regardless of specialty, can legally administer cosmetic injections without any special training or certification. That includes dentists.

Durand and Hamilton both recommend going to a plastic surgeon or dermatologist's office. Though Berkowitz says there are skilled injectors outside these specialties. She recommends that a Botox-curious patient ask friends or family for a referral.

Most people who get cosmetic procedures say they're happy with the outcome. Sarwer says the patients who are most satisfied are seeking to address discontent with a specific feature — like Moore's desire to soften the lines around her eyes.

But the evidence on how these procedures improve self esteem and quality of life are inconclusive, Sarwer says.

When cosmetic patients chase an unattainable ideal of beauty due to a mental health condition like body dysmorphic disorder or severe depression, Sarwer says Botox and other procedures don't improve their symptoms.

He explains these patients are, ""better treated by a mental health professional than they would be treated by a plastic surgeon.""

A life-long habit ... and expense

Durand turns away patients who want so much Botox that it would essentially freeze their face, blocking their ability to form expressions. ""That looks terrible,"" he says.

But in his experience, a determined enough person will eventually find a clinician to say ""yes,"" given that administering Botox can be a lucrative revenue stream with relatively few overhead costs.

Not only do clinician training and skill levels vary, so do prices. Discount treatments are unlikely to yield desired results, as Berkowitz warns. Amateur Botox can result in an obviously treated face.

And there's another problem: Once patients start with Botox or a similar injectable, they're unlikely to stop, says Berkowitz: ""You get people in their 20s, you have a lifelong consumer.""

Berkowitz herself is one of those lifelong consumers: She started getting Botox at 32 and now at 47, needs higher doses, paying about $800 per appointment.

For someone who starts young, that money — which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars in your 20s and 30s — could be spent paying off student loans, investing for their future, or traveling the world.

If you stop getting the injections, the effects wear off and wrinkles reappear.

In this way, Botox is addictive, argues Berkowitz, who admits that getting it feels in conflict with her feminist ethics, which aim to decenter appearance.

But Hamilton, the Houston plastic surgeon, says for many of her young patients, Botox is simply part of their overall investment in their health and appearance.

""Gen Z have this very different view on these things,"" she says. ""This is part of their self-care. It's part of their wellness.""

Stephanie Moore in Pittsburgh, says shaping her appearance with Botox makes her happy. She notes that her husband has tattoos, which she thinks are unnecessary and expensive.

""But that's his body and his choice,"" she says. ""And this is my body and my choice.""

The storm blew into Cozad, Nebraska, in the wee hours of Saturday, June 29, 2024. The wind felt like a hurricane. The hail was the size of softballs.

""I was in the window, I was crying,"" remembers Soledad Avalos, who has lived with her husband in their home in Cozad for 35 years. ""Seeing all the damage [to] the cars and the house.""

When the sun came up, the extent of the damage became clear. Cozad is a small town of about 4,000 people, surrounded by corn fields. Crops were flattened. Virtually every vehicle parked outside that night had a broken windshield. Nearly every roof in town was leaking, or worse. Siding was missing, paint had been stripped away. The storm came from the northwest, and so nearly every northwest-facing window was cracked. Both the hospital and the school were in disrepair.

""Those softball-sized hail stones just punched a hole through the roof membrane, and water was just pouring through the ceiling like a waterfall, or a shower,"" says Robert Dyer, the CEO of the Cozad Community Health System, which runs Cozad Community Hospital, the only hospital in town. ""Tiles were coming down, hunks of old plaster. It was just pretty devastating."" The hospital's emergency department had to shut down for several hours, and the building is still being repaired more than a year later.

Hailstorms like the one that hit Cozad don't often make national headlines, because they are usually hyper-local events that hit just one town, or one neighborhood in a larger city. Most hailstorms don't cause enough damage to trigger federal disaster declarations, or make it onto official annual lists of major weather disasters. And they are generally less deadly than flash floods, hurricanes and wildfires.

But extremely costly hailstorms are getting more likely in the United States, researchers warn. Across the central and eastern U.S., the weather conditions that can produce hail that's at least the size of a pool ball have gotten more common, according to Deborah Bathke, Nebraska's state climatologist. And the Great Plains are expected to have more frequent hail as the planet warms up.

That risk is driving up the cost of home insurance in the middle of the country, saddling average Americans with huge bills. Areas with the most hail risk are seeing some of the fastest growing home insurance prices in the U.S., according to two landmark federal reports released in the last year.

""In the Midwest, you've seen a surprising increase in losses,"" says Robert Gordon, a senior vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest property insurance trade group. ""It's particularly the hail, the wind. A lot of damage to roofs.""

That escalating damage is a reminder that, as climate change drives more extreme weather, geography is no longer a guarantee of protection from skyrocketing insurance rates.

Home insurance costs are skyrocketing in the middle of the U.S.

The central United States is home to the worst hail risk on the planet.

""North America is the hail continent,"" explains Scott St. George, a climate scientist and the head of weather and climate research at WTW, an international risk analysis company. And he says hail is different from other types of severe weather because it does a lot of property damage without causing many fatalities.

""It basically damages anything that's outside. And we've got a lot of stuff in the way,"" according to St. George. ""There are more houses insured, more expensive cars. Roofs, siding, car windows and exteriors.""

That has led to enormous bills for property insurance companies. ""You've seen some really big losses coming out of hail, mostly in the U.S."" says St. George.

Last summer's hailstorm in Cozad caused an estimated $100 million in property damage, according to local insurance agent Brian Messersmith – an enormous sum for a town of just 4,000 people.

And, in 2024, hail damage contributed to $54 billion in insured losses from severe convective storms in the U.S., which include severe thunderstorms and other storms capable of producing large hail, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry-run think tank.

With losses mounting, insurance companies have raised prices in recent years. Nationwide, the cost of insurance rose about 8% faster than inflation between 2018 and 2022, according to a major report published by the Treasury Department in January.

The report found that the average price of property insurance in the Great Plains was significantly higher than the national average, with consumers in the Northern Plains paying about 20% more than the national average, and consumers in the Southern Plains paying more than 45% more. In Nebraska, the average cost of homeowners insurance this year is nearly $6,400, according to Bankrate. That's the highest in the country, and almost $4,000 above the national average.

In September, the Treasury report was removed from the department's website by the Trump administration. The Treasury Department did not respond to questions from NPR about why it was removed.

Hail risk is only one of many reasons that insurance is more expensive. The higher cost of labor, and of construction materials are also driving up insurance prices, says St. George.

""Insurance is very impacted by inflation,"" says Robert Gordon of the American Property and Casualty Insurance Association. ""So if inflation suddenly spikes, then insurance losses go up."" And the cost of building materials has increased even more than other goods in recent years, he points out.

Insurance companies are bringing in profits. Small towns are struggling

Rising prices for homeowners appear to be translating into profits for the industry. After losing more than $10 billion in 2023, the industry saw $26 billion in profits in 2024, according to credit agency AM Best.

Insurers say that's largely due to the severity of disasters in a given year. ""It can be a dramatic swing because some years you have huge catastrophes,"" says Gordon. When insurers raise prices, they are simply passing along the enormous costs of rebuilding from major disasters, he says.

But high prices are hitting many homeowners hard, particularly in places with historically low cost-of-living, like Nebraska.

""Insurance in our state really has skyrocketed the past several years,"" says Josh Tapio, an insurance broker at All Lines Insurance in Omaha, Neb.

A few years ago, an average homeowner would pay about $1,500 per year to insure their $300,000 home, Tapio says. Now, it costs between $3,000 to $4,500, a two or even threefold increase.

""There's a lot of sticker shock when somebody opens their renewal bill and they see that it's double from what they paid last year,"" Tapio says. His office has never been busier, as people shop around for a policy they can afford.

The high cost of insurance can make property ownership untenable. Before the storm, longtime Cozad resident Jennifer McKeone owned two rental houses in town. The hail caused extensive damage to both, and her insurance company refused to keep insuring them.

""I scrambled to find insurance, and the only insurance I could find was going to raise the rent to the point where I didn't think the people who lived in the houses could afford it,"" McKeone says. She ended up selling the homes, because neither she nor her tenants could afford the insurance costs.

Seniors are hit particularly hard by rising insurance costs

In the year and a half since the storm hit Cozad, most of the broken windows have been replaced, and most of the leaking roofs have been repaired. ""The town is doing well,"" says McKeone, who runs the Cozad Development Corporation, a local group that builds housing in town and works with businesses.

But under the surface, McKeone says, many are still trying to finish repairs to their homes. Seniors have been hit particularly hard, she says. Many older residents live on a fixed income from a pension or social security payments, and can't afford drastically higher bills.

Baltazar and Soledad Avalos, whose home was severely damaged in the storm, have experienced insurance problems firsthand. The home that they've lived in for 35 years had an insurance policy, but that policy didn't cover the full cost of all the repairs to the roof, windows and siding. Baltazar is still out on a ladder most days, fixing damage at age 72.

On top of that, the cost of their insurance has gone up by about 10%, which is significant for a retirement-age couple. Baltazar is retired, Soledad is still working.

Insurance is more expensive, and it covers less

One of the biggest complaints among Cozad residents is that, even as they shell out more for property insurance, that insurance is covering less.

Many people in town now have policies with higher deductibles, meaning that they need to pay thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before the insurance kicks in. And many new policies also don't cover the full cost of replacing a damaged roof, which is often the most expensive repair after a hailstorm.

Megan Fales has worked as an insurance agent in Cozad for more than a decade, and handles hundreds of home insurance policies in town. ""A lot of people have just gotten to the point where, like 'Let's just take a higher deductible,'"" she says, because it costs less each month, even though they agree to pay more for repairs if there's a future storm. She says many homeowners in the area hope to save money by doing repairs themselves, instead of relying on insurance to pay.

Businesses in town are also paying more money for less coverage. After the storm destroyed the roof of the local hospital, the insurance company refused to renew the policy. The only policies available are more expensive, and also have a much higher deductible for the roof. That means the hospital must pay more each month for insurance, and also must keep more cash on hand in case there's another storm.

In an effort to avoid catastrophic damage in future storms, the hospital's governing board chose to upgrade the building. Instead of simply replacing the damaged roof, they are investing in roof materials that can withstand high winds and small hail.

That choice saved them money on their monthly insurance premium, Dyer says. But even with those savings, they are paying more money for less coverage, compared to two years ago.

""It's to a point of unsustainability,"" says Dyer. ""If we got hit by another storm right now, it would drain all our cash.""

When he was looking for ‘80s tech inspiration and equipment for the fifth and final season of Stranger Things, special effects designer Shane Dzicek knew exactly where to go: Apex Surplus, a scrap metal recycling and industrial surplus business in Sun Valley.

“They're well known in the industry for being a place to rent a lot of hard-to-find electronics,” Dzicek said. “Imagine walking into a shop that would be in the world of Harry Potter, and there's just racks that go to the ceiling with everything that you can think of … military and airplane supplies to electronics … vintage microphones and knife switches.”

In addition to various knobs that he repurposed for the show, Dzicek also found an FM signal generator from the ‘80s, which served as a model for a decibel-reading device used by the character Steve Harrington, as seen in the teaser trailer:

Dzicek isn’t the only special effects designer who’s walked the halls of Apex Surplus. The shop’s co-owner, Adam Isaacs, estimates their credits span 5,000 different productions, including sci-fi classics like Back to the Future, Mad Max, Star Wars, Star Trek and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

So how did a nearly 70-year-old recycling business become a go-to destination for Hollywood designers?

The origins: A Holocaust survivor meets the SoCal aerospace industry

Apex Surplus is a third-generation family-owned business, first opened in 1958 by husband and wife Bill and Charlotte Slater.

Bill Slater was a Holocaust survivor who fled Austria in the 1940s and served in the U.S. army during World War II. After the war, he moved to Southern California, which was at the height of the aerospace industry boom.

With the space race raging, aerospace companies like Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Bendix Company were building at a rapid rate, with lots of materials left over. Slater decided to leverage his military connections and open an aerospace liquidation business and surplus front.

“ My grandpa would drive around with a semi-truck in the ‘60s and ‘70s and essentially recycle all of their old scrap metal,” according to Isaacs, who said subsidiaries of the aerospace hub in San Fernando Valley would then come to Apex to shop for secondary parts.

As Apex’s inventory grew in the 1960s, Isaacs said the business expanded and started catching the eye of set decorators and production designers in the TV and film industry.

Apex today: From oddball artist haven to film prop shop

After Bill and Charlotte Slater’s death, Apex was passed down to their children, Melissa and Don Slater.

Melissa now co-owns Apex Surplus with her son, Adam Isaacs, who said customers today range from folks outside the film industry, like electricians, plumbers, sculptors and artists, to set and production designers who work on films — anyone with a practical, aesthetic or historical interest in vintage or obsolete electronics.

Isaacs said, at heart, Apex still is a scrap metal, electronics and aerospace recycling and surplus business, though its also has embraced its role as a film prop and rental house.

More recently, its products have been featured in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., 13 Reasons Why, A.P. Bio and Avatar.

“Our close proximity to Hollywood has allowed us to open up this prop division and work with a lot of talented people,” Isaacs said. “There's so much creativity and artistry being produced in L.A. … We're very fortunate that we were able to reinvent ourselves as a production hub.”

The Eleventh Circuit held that CNN's use of the phrase the ""Big Lie,"" to describe President Trump's attacks on the 2020 election, was not defamatory because it did not constitute a false statement of fact and was constitutionally protected opinion.

In October 2022, President Trump sued CNN over the network's coverage of the 2020 election. President Trump claimed that the news organization defamed him by using the term the ""Big Lie"" to describe the President's claims about the 2020 election.

The court explained that the President's ""stacking of inferences""—that the phrase linked the President to Hitler and was attributed to Joseph Goebbels—""cannot support a finding of falsehood.""

On appeal, President Trump argued that the district court got it wrong. The President claimed that the challenged statement was was not opinion. President Trump further argued that by using the phrase the ""Big Lie,"" CNN implied that Trump's ""actions and statements were designed to be, and actually were, variations of those [that] Hitler used to suppress and destroy populations.""

The Eleventh Circuit disagreed and affirmed the lower court's decision. The Court held that ""CNN's subjective assessment of Trump's conduct is not readily capable of being proven true or false."" The Court emphasized that both President Trump and CNN had different interpretations of how the President handled his ""concerns"" over the 2020 election—and that both were ""subjective interpretations."" Because the President failed to allege falsity, the Court held he failed to state a claim for defamation. The three-judge panel included two justices appointed by President Trump.

And that brings us to the Mapping Deportations project.
Kelly Lytle Hernández is an historian at UCLA and author of one of my favorite books about immigration history: Migra!
When the federal government constructed a national immigration system in the late nineteenth century, it inherited and institutionalized these logics.
For teachers, researchers, and anyone attempting to understand how we arrived at this moment, Mapping Deportations provides an essential resource.","Nearly every conversation I have with fellow immigration scholars these days arrives at a similar crux: although the current Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda is the most aggressive we’ve seen in modern history, the hyper-focus on the current moment detracts from the longer history of how we got here. Trump is wielding tools created for him by Democrats and Republicans over many decades, despite a chorus of concern from scholars and advocates. We hand Trump a chainsaw, then act shocked when trees start to fall.

It is tempting to think that the best way to understand our current political crisis is to stay glued to every policy announcement, every tragic news story, every contemporaneous analysis of this new mass deportation regime. But we might be served just as well—or better—by stepping back from the clickbait firehose to understand the peculiar historical and political forces that animate, and have always animated, our immigration system.

Antonio Gramsci’s theoretical distinction between conjunctural and organic crises is applicable here: conjunctural crises emerge at peculiar moments (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) out of deeper systemic factors (e.g., the circulation of capital). We might be able to solve conjunctural crises through policies and elections; organic crises require deeper tectonic shifts in the organization of society.

In immigration terms, we are living in a moment rife with everyday crises experienced by millions of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike, but the origins of this period of human suffering do not originate in the results of the 2024 election. The conditions for our moment are, as the thinking goes, baked into the U.S. immigration system itself and cannot be solved without a more profound reckoning. And that brings us to the Mapping Deportations project.

Mapping Deportations: An Ambitious Project That Meets the Urgent Needs of Our Moment

The recently launched Mapping Deportations project emerges from this line of research and critique as a rich source of historical deportation data and policies that illustrates the longstanding relationship between immigration controls and structural racism. The project examines the data, policy, and racial ideologies behind immigration policy from 1790 to today, and integrates this deep research into an engaging and interactive website portfolio that is easy to recommend for teachers, students, and researchers looking for a single, comprehensive source of vetted information.

The project assembles archival documents, digitized deportation ledgers, visualizations of annual removal counts, and timelines tracing the evolution of immigration law from 1790 through the present. When read together, these sources reveal how deportation has always functioned as a tool for shaping national identity, maintaining racial hierarchy, and defining who belongs. The dataset covers more than eight million formal deportation orders and when voluntary departure and border expulsions are included, the dataset balloons to over 58 million removals.

The website is highly interactive, with charts, timelines, maps, videos, and historical images that unpack the data across several eras of immigration enforcement and control. Mapping Deportations is more than a creative aggregation of existing information about immigration history, although it is partly that, too; there is a lot of new information that even the already-well-informed reader will find compelling. Integrating so many different data sources, as well as addressing the changing U.S. policies across various eras about how “deportation” is even counted, is an enormous lift.

For me, one of the most valuable resources on the site is not just the excellent visualizations, it’s the robust documentation of the methodology behind the project under their sources page. This ensures that whether you think about the project’s main theoretical arguments, they have laid out exactly how they did the work so that you can think through it for yourself, too. Researchers will greatly appreciate this.

The quality of the project will not be a surprise once you know who is behind it. Mapping Deportations was a collaboration between the Center for Immigration Law and Policy (CILP) at the UCLA School of Law and Million Dollar Hoods Project . Ahilan Arulanantham, professor at UCLA School of Law, is a brilliant legal strategist and among our most critical immigration thinkers. Kelly Lytle Hernández is an historian at UCLA and author of one of my favorite books about immigration history: Migra! A History of U.S. Border Patrol. She is easily one of the nation’s leading experts on race and immigration history. Mariah Tso is a GIS Specialist for the Ralph J. Bunche Center and the Million Dollar Hoods Project. Her creativity and expertise are all over the website. All my gratitude to this team as well as everyone who worked on the project or funded it.

After sifting through the project over the past few weeks and thinking about what this history means for us right now, I would like to use the Mapping Deportation’s findings to elaborate on my opening argument about the importance of understanding our current “mass deportation” moment in much longer history that is not so easily bounded by the current administration. I want to be clear: this is not at all to suggest that the current immigration policies are entirely in lock-step with all previous administrations—not at all. They are uniquely aggressive and should be taken seriously now. One need not be a bona fide immigration historian to offer substantive and powerful critiques. Rather, I only mean to lend evidence to the idea that in order to have better debates about what to do now, and what to do next, we must truly understand how we got here in the first place.

Has “Mass Deportation” Always Been the Official U.S. Policy?

The numbers that emerge from Mapping Deportations are staggering in their scale and consistency. Since 1895, when federal immigration authorities began publishing annual deportation counts, the U.S. government has issued more than eight million formal deportation orders. When voluntary departures and border expulsions are included in the accounting, that figure balloons to more than 58 million forced removals. To put this in perspective, 58 million removals represents a system of population control that rivals the largest displacement operations in modern history, sustained not through temporary crisis but through permanent institutional architecture.

What makes these numbers particularly revelatory is not just their magnitude but their distribution. More than 96 percent of all deportation orders since 1895 were issued to people from non-white majority countries, a pattern so stable across different eras, agency reorganizations, and shifts in political rhetoric that it suggests something far more fundamental than policy preference or enforcement priorities. Mexico alone accounts for 5.6 million deportation orders. When Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador are added to this count, the Western Hemisphere makes up eighty-eight percent of all recorded deportation orders in the dataset. That the United States built the largest deportation system in the world is significant; that this system has overwhelmingly targeted non-white communities across more than a century is foundational to understanding what deportation actually is and does.

The Mapping Deportations project makes it possible to see these patterns not as isolated episodes or the unfortunate byproducts of geographic proximity, but as evidence of one continuous historical structure. The project’s timeline, which tracks the evolution of immigration control from 1790 through the present, demonstrates how racial logic became enforcement infrastructure. Long before deportation was a formal federal process, the Naturalization Act of 1790 restricted the right to naturalize to free white persons.” The first immigration bans in 1803 prevented ship captains from bringing “negro, mulatto, or other persons of color” into states that prohibited their entry. These early statutes established the terms on which the later apparatus would be built, encoding into law the principle that immigration control was fundamentally about maintaining racial boundaries.

When the federal government constructed a national immigration system in the late nineteenth century, it inherited and institutionalized these logics. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 created the first federal deportation mechanisms, and Congress spent the following decades refining removal categories aimed at people deemed undesirable”: public charges, sex workers, the diseased, the disabled, the politically suspect. These categories were presented as neutral administrative classifications, but they functioned as the vocabulary of racial hierarchy, eugenic thought, and class anxiety. Supreme Court decisions in the 1880s and 1890s reinforced this emerging system by granting Congress virtually absolute power to exclude or deport immigrants while denying noncitizens the constitutional protections afforded to criminal defendants, a legal architecture that remains in place today.

The reforms that followed did little to alter the racial structure of the system even when they changed its statutory language. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act abolished the explicitly racist national origins quotas of the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, which had been designed to engineer the U.S. population by favoring northern and western Europeans. But the same 1965 reforms that opened pathways for Asian and African immigrants inserted new restrictions on the Western Hemisphere that dramatically reduced legal pathways from Mexico and Central America. Combined with the end of the Bracero program that same decade, these changes helped produce the undocumented migration flows that politicians would later point to as justification for expanded enforcement. The reforms of the 1960s were followed in short order by the detention of Haitian asylum seekers in the 1980s, the criminalization of migration through employer sanctions and border prosecutions in the late 1980s and 1990s, and the eventual construction of the mass deportation infrastructure we live with today.

The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act represents a critical inflection point in this history. IIRIRA created expedited removal, expanded the aggravated felony category to include minor offenses, authorized the 287(g) program that embedded immigration enforcement into local policing, and established mandatory detention for wide categories of immigrants. After 1996, immigration enforcement fused with the criminal legal system in ways that dramatically accelerated the scale of removals. Local police arrests became inputs into ICE databases. Minor convictions triggered automatic detention and deportation. Border prosecutions surged until unlawful entry became the most prosecuted federal crime in the country. After September 11, 2001, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement embedded immigration enforcement even more deeply into the infrastructure of domestic security, treating migration as a matter of national threat rather than social and economic policy.

What emerged was not simply a larger version of the earlier system but a qualitatively different enforcement regime, one optimized for mass processing through technology, surveillance, and bureaucratic automation. Programs like Secure Communities and the Criminal Alien Program placed ICE inside nearly every local jail in the country. Title 42 expulsions during the COVID-19 pandemic removed more than 2.8 million people outside the asylum system entirely. The Mexico-U.S. border was transformed into an enforcement zone where rapid removals often go uncounted in national statistics, rendering large portions of this displacement invisible to public scrutiny. And yet through all of these changes, the racial patterns remained astonishingly consistent. The majority of people removed under this new regime continued to be Mexicans and Central Americans. The project argues that Black immigrants, though a smaller proportion of the overall total, were disproportionately funneled into the deportation system through criminal legal system referrals, mirroring the racialized policing that affects Black Americans more broadly.

The discriminatory logic of the system surfaced clearly during the pandemic, when the government invoked Title 42 to expel Haitian asylum seekers en masse while largely exempting Ukrainian refugees fleeing war. Based on available data from the twenty-six months between March 2020 and May 2022, the U.S. government issued nearly two million Title 42 expulsions, with 94 percent directed at citizens of Mexico and Central America. This is not the behavior of a system responding neutrally to migration flows or public health concerns but of one structured around longstanding patterns of racial exclusion that adapt to new justifications while maintaining their underlying architecture.

Understanding Deportation as Racial Control Rather Than Simply Administrative Necessity

The Mapping Deportations project includes a remarkable collection of primary source quotations from lawmakers, immigration officials, and public figures spanning more than a century, assembled in a section titled “In Their Own Words.” These quotations are not marginal or eccentric expressions of individual prejudice but represent the mainstream discourse that shaped immigration law and enforcement. Officials spoke openly for decades about protecting America as a “white nation,” guarding “American stock,” and excluding races deemed undesirable or dangerous. Madison Grant’s influential 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race described immigration control as essential to preserving “Homo Europeus the white man par excellence.” Congressional testimony from the 1920s characterized immigration control as “the greatest instrument which the federal government can use in promoting race conservation of the nation.” Representative John Box of Texas warned in 1928 that Mexican immigration represented “the most insidious and general mixture of white, Indian, and negro blood strains ever produced in America.”

These were not rhetorical flourishes disconnected from policy: they were the ideological framework that guided the creation of immigration law itself. The quotations that contemporary officials use may be more coded, but the structural continuity is unmistakable. When Stephen Miller, communications director for Senator Jeff Sessions and later senior advisor to President Trump, suggested in leaked emails that the country should return to the immigration principles established by Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s, he was explicitly invoking the era of national origins quotas and racial exclusion. When President Trump asked in 2018 why the U.S. was not letting more people in from Europe and described immigrants as “poisoning the blood of our country,” he was reaching for the same eugenic language that shaped the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions referred to immigrants as “filth” during a 2017 speech announcing renewed immigration enforcement, he was deploying rhetoric that echoes more than a century of dehumanizing discourse used to justify exclusion and removal.

The artistically re-imagined maps below showcases more than a century of immigration ideology into a pair of unsettling images by pairing political quotes with policies that enacted them. Each statement highlights how U.S. leaders have repeatedly described non-white immigrants as threats to national identity, purity or security. The map exposes historical and contemporary rhetoric side by side by showcasing the links between Chinese exclusion act, The Muslim Ban and Title 42. These policies have functioned as tools to maintain the racial hierarchy. The map argues that whites-only immigration regimes did not end but has simply evolved into new legal forms that produce similar outcomes.

To name this system as one built on racial hierarchy is not to deny the legal violations that can trigger deportation proceedings or to dismiss the complexity of managing migration flows. It is to acknowledge the architecture we have inherited and to recognize that enforcement categories rooted in racial thinking do not become neutral simply because the language has been sanitized. When a system built on those categories grows into a mass removal apparatus capable of processing millions of people, its underlying design becomes even more consequential for the lives it touches and the society it shapes. The Mapping Deportations data make clear that this is not a story about episodic failures or unfortunate excesses within an otherwise sound framework. It is a story about a system working largely as designed across more than a century of operation, pursuing the same populations with remarkable consistency despite dramatic changes in political leadership, agency structure, and statutory language.

As I said at the outset, this is the lesson that the contemporary fixation on the Trump administration’s policies threatens to obscure. The tools Trump has wielded so aggressively were not created by his administration but assembled over decades by Democratic and Republican lawmakers responding to different political pressures and constituencies. The infrastructure that makes mass deportation possible today, the databases and detention centers and expedited removal proceedings and border prosecution programs, represents the accumulated policy choices of multiple generations. Trump’s innovation has been primarily (though not exclusively) rhetorical, his willingness to speak more openly about the racial logics that previous administrations worked to obscure, but the machinery itself is older and more bipartisan than most contemporary political discourse acknowledges.

Our Next Steps as a Country Requires Embracing Uncomfortable but Essential Historical Understandings

The Mapping Deportations project offers something increasingly rare in our current information environment: the patient accumulation of evidence across a timescale long enough to reveal patterns that shorter analyses miss. By documenting every recorded deportation from 1895 forward and situating that data within the fuller context of immigration control reaching back to 1790, the project makes it possible to see our present moment not as an aberration but as the latest expression of logics embedded in the system from its inception. In Gramsci’s terms, the data assembled by Mapping Deportations suggests that we are witnessing an organic crisis, not a conjunctural one.”

This is uncomfortable knowledge, precisely because it suggests that addressing the humanitarian crises we are witnessing will require confronting the deeper architecture of immigration enforcement itself and asking whether—or how—a system built for racial ordering can be reformed into one that treats migration as something other than a threat to be managed and a population to be controlled.

For teachers, researchers, and anyone attempting to understand how we arrived at this moment, Mapping Deportations provides an essential resource. The project’s timelines offer a comprehensive single source for tracking the evolution of immigration law and enforcement. And perhaps most importantly, the project models how to engage with historical evidence in ways that take both the scale of the data and the voices in the archive seriously, neither minimizing the violence documented in the numbers nor treating the racist language of lawmakers as mere historical curiosity disconnected from the systems those words helped build. In a political moment characterized by both urgent crisis and deliberate historical amnesia, this kind of patient, evidence-based work offers a foundation for understanding not just where we are but how we got here, and what it might take to build something different.

The ICE spokesperson said Beltran-Flores “was physically aggressive” when ICE agents identified themselves.","Federal immigration officials detained two people adjacent to courthouses in Bellingham, in an apparent violation of state law.

The arrests, which happened on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3, were either in a court facility parking lot or across the street from the courthouse.

Guidance released by the Department of Homeland Security in January allows for immigration arrests in and near courthouses. Agents must check with DHS lawyers for any jurisdictional legal restrictions.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson confirmed the identities of the two men, Fabian Pablo Beltran-Flores and Adolfo Felipe Mendoza-Cruz, and told Cascadia Daily News they “abused our border as a revolving door.”

“These individuals were not seeking the American dream — they knowingly violated our laws and endangered public safety,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said Beltran-Flores and Mendoza-Cruz’s arrest were “conducted in accordance with established procedures, protocols and authorities as outlines in ICE policy.”

Security footage captures first arrest

On the morning of Oct. 30, Mendoza-Cruz, originally from Guatemala, walks into Bellingham Municipal Court to be arraigned on a DUI. He likely doesn’t know a plainclothed federal agent follows him into the courtroom.

The agent does not tell security or court personnel he is a law enforcement official and does not sign in, as required by state law, said Melissa Morin, a communication specialist for the City of Bellingham.

As part of the Courts Open to All Act, all law enforcement — municipal, county, state and federal — should sign in with court personnel, including their name, the agency they are with, the specific law enforcement purpose and the action that’s going to be taken. The only exception is if the law enforcement official is participating in court proceedings.

Just before 10 a.m., Mendoza-Cruz leaves the courtroom and walks to the adjacent parking lot, the video shows. A handful of cars are captured in the security footage. Another man stands next to a car and lights a cigarette.

Suddenly, a gray Dodge Charger drives up to the two men, blocking exit routes. Six federal agents, some wearing Homeland Security Investigations vests and one wearing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vest, surround Mendoza-Cruz, who was wearing a white ball cap.

Another federal agent, wearing a blue jacket, comes into the video and pulls up a face covering.

At least two more unmarked support vehicles arrive with more agents. By the time Mendoza-Cruz is detained, five minutes have passed since he left the courtroom. Seven unmarked cars leave the parking lot.

In response, city staff made the report to the AG’s office, Morin said. Bellingham Police Deputy Chief Jay Hart confirmed with federal officials that the detainment was an ICE removal operation.

Municipal Court Judge Debra Lev reported the incident to the state Administrative Office of the Courts.

ICE claims Mendoza-Cruz is a suspected member of the Surenos gang. His “rap sheet includes a conviction for negligent driving and a recent arrest for driving under the influence,” according to the spokesperson.

Second arrest shows surveillance

On Nov. 3, four days later, another plainclothes federal officer arrives at Whatcom County District Court around 8:30 a.m. Video footage captures him waving his badge at security and going to the fourth floor of the courthouse. A district court administrator said they had no record of a federal agency signing in.

Twenty minutes later, Beltran-Flores, originally from Mexico, arrives at District Court for his hearing. Footage shows the federal officer surveilling Beltran-Flores for more than an hour and a half. At one point, they cross in front of each other and ride the elevator together to the rotunda.

At 10:38 a.m., Beltran-Flores leaves the courthouse with the federal agent following behind. Beltran-Flores crosses the street to Bellingham City Hall, where he is detained by ICE on the sidewalk.

During the arrest, at least six officers throw him to the ground before placing him in an unmarked vehicle. The ICE spokesperson said Beltran-Flores “was physically aggressive” when ICE agents identified themselves. The video shows an altercation and Beltran-Flores trying to run.

“Beltran has a long history of defying U.S. immigration laws, with multiple orders of removal and voluntary returns to his home country,” the spokesperson said, listing convictions for false identification, possession of a stolen vehicle, entering a noncommercial dwelling, obstruction, evading, possessing controlled substances and reckless driving.

The entire detainment took two minutes.

Morin said a city staffer witnessed the detainment and approached one of the unmarked vehicles parked outside City Hall.

The employee “spoke to one of the (presumed) ICE agents, asking them to identify themselves,” Morin said. The agent did not reply and “drove away.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday firmly rejected pressure from the Trump administration on European migration policy, stressing that such decisions remain the sovereign right of European nations.

Responding to reports that the US State Department had directed American diplomats to lobby against pro-migration policies in Europe, Merz underlined that European governments would chart their own course.

""Migration policy is our business, and we decide it as we see fit. And we in Germany have been on the right track since the change of government,"" the conservative leader said, referring to his coalition government taking office in May and implementing stricter policies to curb illegal migration.

""We don't need any admonitions from outside. Furthermore, we are in the process of formulating a new, common European asylum and immigration policy. We can do that on our own, and we will do it on our own,"" he added.

Several US media outlets reported earlier that the Trump administration had ordered American diplomats in Europe to lobby against pro-migration policies and advocate for tighter immigration regulations.

The US State Department said Friday that it has directed its embassies to report on alleged human rights consequences of mass migration in Europe, including in Britain, Sweden, and Germany.

""Mass migration poses an existential threat to Western civilization and may undermine the stability of key American allies,"" the department said in a statement on US social media company X.

The guidance asks embassies to gather information on policies perceived as lenient toward migrant crime and human rights abuses, as well as laws that may penalize citizens who object to mass migration.

To access COPS money, the DOJ has insisted that cities certify they do not operate diversity, equity and inclusion programs and they will cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

That isn’t St. Paul’s only legal battle with the White House.

In another recent skirmish, Minnesota’s capital city had been counting on more than $560,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand Evie — a network of electric vehicle charging stations aimed at boosting car-sharing — into low- to moderate-income neighborhoods on the city’s East Side. In October, word came that the funding had been eliminated, alongside more than $7.5 billion in grants for clean energy projects across 16 states, all of which were states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

“The Trump administration’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in climate grants targeted communities based solely on politics,” said Jennifer Lor, a spokesperson for Carter’s office. “In St. Paul, this decision cut the remaining funds from our $560,844 subgrant, slowing our groundbreaking work to expand clean, affordable, and reliable electric car-share options across the city’s East Side.”

Growing legal actions by city

The loss of energy-related grants forms the basis of yet another new federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, the latest in a growing number of legal actions filed by St. Paul and other municipalities and nonprofits alleging constitutional violations and federal overreach.

It’s been a busy year for St. Paul City Attorney Lyndsey Olson and her legal team, who have represented the city in at least five major legal battles with the Trump administration while trying to protect upwards of $200 million in federal funding that could be withheld from the city’s housing, public safety, clean energy and transportation initiatives.

The White House has derided so-called “woke” policies, including St. Paul’s 2004 separation ordinance, which prohibits city employees from asking residents their immigration status before delivering city services. In response, “blue” cities have accused the Trump administration of blatant political retaliation for not stepping into line with the president’s executive orders, including bans on language around diversity, equity and inclusion outreach, or “DEI.”

“We’re certainly being targeted and punished,” said Olson on Tuesday. “Our residents are being punished. Taxpayers are being punished in ways that are political and don’t have anything to do with the grants. The courts say this is not legal … and they keep doing it.”

St. Paul has company. Chicago has filed upwards of 40 legal actions against federal agencies, accusing them of playing politics with vital grant funding. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its own legal action against St. Paul and other “blue” cities that don’t fall into step with its immigration policies, though the lawsuit was not served on the city until late November, Olson said.

With a new mayoral administration coming in following the election this month of Mayor-elect Kaohly Her over Mayor Melvin Carter, Olson said she expects to be leaving City Hall around January, as most St. Paul mayors handpick their chief attorney. She said she anticipates whomever holds her position in the months ahead to face similar battles with the White House, and Her has made no secret of her disdain for the president’s approach toward immigration enforcement.

“It’s not just the filing of the lawsuits and the litigation piece,” Olson said. “It’s tracking everything they’re doing all the time. … They’ll put new terms into grant agreements that are already in process. They’ll say ‘we’re going to withhold money until you agree to these terms.’ I think that’s our new normal for the remainder of this (presidential) administration. I think blue cities are being targeted.”

Here’s a look at six lawsuits involving St. Paul and the Trump administration:

San Francisco v. Trump

In February, St. Paul signed onto a lawsuit, led by the city of San Francisco, accusing the Trump administration of attempting to commandeer city services by denying federal funding to municipalities that don’t fall in line with its executive orders and immigration policies. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, alleges that the White House is violating the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states.

In a written posting to its website, the White House that week called out the St. Paul mayor by name, as well as other city leaders in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles for immigrant-friendly policies that the president claimed protected “killers, rapists and drug dealers.” St. Paul has maintained a “separation ordinance” that bars city employees from asking residents about their immigration status while delivering core city services.

Olson said her team has “argued forcefully that St. Paul’s ordinance, in place since 2004, does not inhibit lawful federal immigration enforcement but appropriately delineates municipal roles under the 10th Amendment.”

The federal district court issued preliminary relief, and the case is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Fresno v. Turner

In August, St. Paul joined a coalition of cities and counties in a federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration for allegedly punishing them by withholding or threatening to withhold $262 million in federal funding grants, including Community Development Block Grants, transportation funding and housing support.

The federal department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, had called on the cities to remove all references to “equity,” transgender rights and “environmental justice” in their grant work. Led by Fresno, Calif., the 10 jurisdictions filed their legal action in the Northern District Court of California, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

St. Paul joined the lawsuit after HUD and other federal agencies threatened to freeze or rescind more than $197.3 million already under contract, and jeopardized an additional $64.9 million in awarded funding “all to force compliance with a political agenda unrelated to the grant programs Congress authorized,” Olson said. “Had the administration succeeded, St. Paul would have faced catastrophic delays in housing development, emergency response projects, youth employment programs, and major infrastructure work such as the Kellogg Bridge replacement. A preliminary injunction protected these critical investments.”

Chicago v. Noem

In October, St. Paul joined Minneapolis, Ramsey County, Chicago, Denver, Boston and other jurisdictions in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly placing “unlawful and unrelated conditions” on more than $100 million in public safety and disaster grants. Olson said the “high-stakes suit” attempts to block “sweeping federal control of local policy.”

Chicago v. Noem, which was filed in federal district court in Illinois, alleges the White House is attempting to force cities and counties to police speech around diversity, equity or inclusion in violation of First Amendment and 10th Amendment rights, which include constitutional arguments around the separation of state and federal powers.

St. Paul alone is at risk of losing $4 million in pending or awarded funds, including funding covering about half the staffing in the city’s nine-person Emergency Management department. Olson said her legal team “emphasized that these conditions were wholly unrelated to the purpose of emergency-preparedness grants” and the lawsuit is intended to protect counterterrorism preparedness, port security, hazard-mitigation projects “and the city’s ability to respond to emergencies without political interference.”

United States v. State of Minnesota

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed legal action against the state of Minnesota, the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, Hennepin County and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office over so-called “sanctuary city” policies that it alleges interfere with federal immigration enforcement.

The federal lawsuit followed similar legal action against Boston, New York City, Colorado and other jurisdictions that have prohibited local law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, including holding jail inmates past their scheduled release date so immigration authorities can determine if they’re wanted on federal immigration warrants. The lawsuit was served on St. Paul about a week ago, Olson said.

St. Paul v. Department of Energy, and Office of Management and Budget

St. Paul signed onto a federal lawsuit this month accusing the Trump administration of abruptly reneging on $7.56 billion in grant funding for 321 clean energy projects — including the city’s Evie car-charging stations — based on the political leanings of the 16 states they’re based in.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Environmental Defense Fund and four other environmental and energy-oriented advocacy groups, alleges constitutional violations of the First and Fifth amendments, which protect the freedom of speech and due process rights.

Chicago v. DOJ

St. Paul and Chicago filed legal action this month to prevent the Department of Justice from imposing sweeping new conditions on grants supporting the federally-backed COPS hiring program, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion-related initiatives, compelled compliance with all executive orders and forced cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed this month in U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois.

“The case challenged unconstitutional conditions that directly conflicted with St. Paul’s separation ordinance and threatened vital community-policing initiatives, including the city’s Downtown Homelessness Initiative,” Olson said.

John Wilson Bennett and Mark Booth Bennett, both U.S. citizens, were arrested late last week on allegations they were planning to carry out attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the department announcement said.

It said the department began an investigation Nov. 17 with the Virginia Beach Police Department after an off-duty Norfolk, Virginia, police officer reported he heard the brothers allegedly discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.”

Mark Bennett also was overheard allegedly saying he was going to Las Vegas to meet with other people to purchase firearms to carry out the attacks, according to the department statement. It said Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at the Norfolk International Airport, where he was set to fly to Las Vegas. Later that day, it said, John Bennett, an assistant principal at Kempsville High School, was arrested in Virginia Beach.

Both of the men were charged with “conspiracy to commit malicious wounding,” according to court records.

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

The brothers and their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.

During a hearing last week in a court in Virginia Beach General District Court, their attorneys said the conversation was hearsay and that the brothers posed no threat to the community, according to Virginia news outlet 13 News Now. The attorneys said Mark Bennett was traveling to Las Vegas for a Formula 1 race before he was apprehended at the Norfolk airport, according to the news report.

They were released on home confinement under pretrial supervision, according to the news report.

McLaughlin’s statement highlighted what she described as a sharp increase in assaults and death threats against immigration officers, including cases of bounties being placed on their heads, threats to their families, stalking and online doxxing.

The arrest comes at a time of heightened tension in the country over federal immigration enforcement.

Homeland Security officials have ramped up enforcement actions under President Donald Trump’s sweeping anti-immigrant crackdown highlighted by mass arrests, including the targeting of Democratic-run cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles for sweeping operations.

The Virginia Beach Police Department confirmed the arrests in a statement and Chief Paul Neudigate called the allegations “incredibly alarming.”

The justices' Wednesday order leaves in effect for now lower court rulings that held that the official, Shira Perlmutter, could not be unilaterally fired.

The case is the latest that relates to Trump’s authority to install his own people at the head of federal agencies. The Supreme Court has largely allowed Trump to fire officials, even as court challenges proceed.

Justice Clarence Thomas said he would have allowed Perlmutter to be fired as her lawsuit proceeds. The court majority, though, decided to wait to make a decision until after they rule in two other lawsuits over Trump firings.

Arguments are set for December in the first case, over the removal of Rebecca Slaughter as a member of the Federal Trade Commission.

And in January the court will hear the case of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who remains in her job despite Trump's attempt to fire her.

Rulings are expected weeks or months after the court hears arguments.

Perlmutter's case concerns an office that is within the Library of Congress. She is the register of copyrights and also advises Congress on copyright issues.

Despite the ties to Congress, the register “wields executive power” in regulating copyrights, Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court.

Perlmutter claims Trump fired her in May because he disapproved of advice she gave to Congress in a report related to artificial intelligence. Perlmutter had received an email from the White House notifying her that “your position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the U.S. Copyright Office is terminated effective immediately,” her office said.

A divided appellate panel ruled that Perlmutter could keep her job while the case moves forward.

Perlmutter’s attorneys have argued that she is a renowned copyright expert. She has served as register of copyrights since then-Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden appointed her to the job in October 2020.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/12bc08b7-9dd3-46f7-8d46-50ad5cda36d0/wirestory_c5ccca29ff5413815347340ffa300f69_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-27 12:57:25.445902

While there is no 25-foot buffer law, police do have the power to impose boundaries to prevent onlookers from impeding their operations.
“He said he was not representing a 25-foot law.
He said federal agents told him at least one suspect was an alleged member of the gang MS-13.","NEW ORLEANS — As officers from Gretna Police and federal immigration agents took down a suspect in front of the Floor & Decor on Wednesday morning, they repeatedly yelled at a man who was filming the scene on his cell phone to back up to a 25-foot buffer zone.

But there is no legal 25-foot buffer zone. The state Legislature passed a 25-foot buffer law in 2024, but it was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge earlier this year and blocked from ever taking effect.

While there is no 25-foot buffer law, police do have the power to impose boundaries to prevent onlookers from impeding their operations.

The video, which was shared by Impacto Informativo and other migrant advocacy groups on Facebook, shows a Gretna police officer in a plaid shirt, tactical vest and backwards baseball cap among six officers and masked ICE agents subduing a suspect on the ground.

After the person shooting the video refused to back up and insisted he could be 10 feet away, the Gretna officer told his colleagues, “I’m gonna hook him; y’all stay here.” He then jumped to his feet, tripped and stumbled to a knee. Then he appeared to push the man filming and shouted, “We have a 25-foot zone! Back up!”

Scott Sternberg represented a group of news organizations, including WWL Louisiana’s parent company, that argued the 25-foot barrier violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and should be blocked. A federal judge in Baton Rouge agreed.

“The law was written in such a way that, you know, the common person, the average person, the smartest person couldn't figure out what was illegal and what was legal,” Sternberg said. “And, 25 feet from an officer could be a balcony on Bourbon Street, or it could be someone who's interfering with an arrest. It could be things that we want to stop and also things that are not illegal.”

After the Gretna officer walked away from the man who was filming the arrest, the man called the agents “absolute fascists.” That prompted the officer to reach for zip ties and say, “Come here.” The video cuts out momentarily and picks up again with the officer in the man’s face inside the store, holding the zip ties, pointing at him and saying, “You’re not allowed,” but stops short and retreats. The man follows him with the camera and says, “I’m absolutely allowed. You’re messing up your words. You cannot arrest me, sir.”

Gretna Deputy Police Chief Jason DiMarco said he’s reviewing the officer’s actions and deciding if any corrective action is needed. DiMarco said the department has informed its officers that there is no 25-foot barrier law.

“He said he was not representing a 25-foot law. He said, ‘I was telling him that he needed to get back. He was being an agitator.’ I don’t think he had any intention on arresting the guy,” DiMarco said.

The group that posted the video, Impacto Informativo, posted other photos of the arrest and commented on it in Spanish. One comment translates to, “Have you considered that you ought to offer more details about these operations publicly to lessen the uncertainty in the community?”

To that DiMarco responded, “I’m 100% on board with that, but I can’t compromise our own investigations or another agency’s investigation.”

He also urged members of the community to bring questions to the department after an arrest rather than during it.

“I answer every question asked because we’re public servants,” DiMarco said. “But the time to engage the officer is not while they’re making an arrest. If people have questions they can direct any question to this department after the arrest.”

He said the only arrests Wednesday were made by ICE, not local law enforcement. He said federal agents told him at least one suspect was an alleged member of the gang MS-13. DiMarco also said the operation was not part of the so-called “Swamp Sweep” operation planned for the New Orleans area by US Customs and Border Protection.",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/WWL/images/62af8637-91ac-4f42-8a29-61c4767111c1/20251126T232815/62af8637-91ac-4f42-8a29-61c4767111c1_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 15:57:01.141842

Trump said Wednesday the shooting ""underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,"" and that the U.S. ""must now reexamine every single alien from Afghanistan who has entered our country under Biden.""

He added that the administration ""must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country.""

What they're saying: Some Republicans in Congress want to go much further that just suspending Afghan immigration.

""We must IMMEDIATELY BAN all ISLAM immigrants and DEPORT every single Islamist who is living among us just waiting to attack,"" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said Wednesday in a post on X.

The sentiment was similar among House members, with Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) writing: ""Deport them all. Now.

""We know the solution,"" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) posted. ""Stop importing Islamists. Deport Islamists.""

Zoom out: The administration has already taken steps to curtail immigration into the U.S., particularly from Muslim-majority countries, as part of its wide-ranging anti-immigration agenda.

Trump announced a travel ban in June that included Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The administration has also terminated temporary protected status for migrants from more than a half dozen countries including Afghanistan and Syria.

What to watch: Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) is pushing for a vote on his bill to require ""recurrent and periodic vetting"" of Afghan refugees who came to the U.S. in 2021 and 2022 without certain documentation.

He wrote on X: ""We must pass my Afghan Vetting Accountability Act to identify and conduct recurrent vetting of evacuees from Afghanistan found not to be properly vetted before entering the United States, so this NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN!""",https://images.axios.com/YgA8yRZsxCsd-9VT4--M0K00n20=/0x0:2748x1546/1366x768/2025/11/27/1764257069167.png,N,,2025-11-27 11:58:08.832771

Miles, an Indigenous actor best known for her roles in “Northern Exposure,” “Smoke Signals,” “Wyvern” and “The Last of Us,” handed them her tribal ID from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon.

Federal government agencies recognize tribal ID as a valid form of identification, and Miles has used it to travel back and forth to Canada and Mexico without any issues.

Yet, Miles recalled one agent calling it “fake.”

“Anyone can make that,” she recalled another agent saying.

Reported encounters between immigration agents and Indigenous people like Miles’ remain rare. But as immigration enforcement has gotten more aggressive, including in the Seattle area, incidents like Miles’ are stoking fears beyond immigrant communities.

Miles said her son and uncle were both detained by ICE agents who initially did not accept their tribal IDs before they were eventually let go.

“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” said Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda, who does not represent Miles. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Miles wrote a social media post about her experience, which came on the same day ICE arrested multiple people at Redmond’s Bear Creek Village shopping center.

The arrests sparked strong reaction in Redmond, including its city council voting to turn off Flock Safety license-plate-reading cameras. Although there’s no evidence immigration authorities used Flock Safety footage to make the arrests, councilmembers said they were concerned about the possibility of it happening in the future.

Miles said the men, whom she worried could have been bounty hunters, did not identify themselves when she asked for their names and badge numbers while they detained her at a bus stop by the shopping center.

When the men did not believe Miles’ tribal ID, she pointed to a phone number for the Umatilla Tribal enrollment office on the back of the card.

“Call it,” she said.

When they didn’t, she took out her phone to call the office herself, but the agents tried unsuccessfully to take her phone, she said. That’s when a fifth agent in the SUV whistled over, and the agents went back to their vehicles and left.

Galanda said the agents’ refusal to recognize Miles’ tribal ID speaks of “a fair amount of ignorance about tribal citizenship generally in society and in government.”

Recently, an Indigenous woman born in Phoenix was mistakenly detained by immigration enforcement upon her discharge from jail in Des Moines, Iowa. She was eventually allowed to leave.

Galanda advises Indigenous people to always be ready with any and all forms of identification in case they are questioned by immigration enforcement, and that they do not escalate the situation.

Still, these detentions have been rare, and Galanda doesn’t want Indigenous people to be afraid.

But for Miles, she said, the damage has been done.

She said she’s afraid to leave the house alone or at night. Her aunt and uncle make her check in with them at the end of every day.

“The prospect of the First Peoples being physically or forcibly stopped or detained is harrowing and reminiscent of this country’s original treatment of the First Peoples,” Galanda said. “It’s also deeply troubling that in 2025, the first people of this country have to essentially look over their shoulders.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11262025_ICE-Miles_tzr_124647.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-11-27 12:57:57.260730

According to protestors, St. Paul police showed up to the scene a little after 10 a.m. and blocked the street to traffic.
St Paul Council Vice President Hwa Jeong Kim said that one of the protestors was slammed on the sidewalk by St. Paul police, according to MPR.
Even though the agents told the community organizers that they had a warrant for one person in the house, Suazo’s family said that their advocates didn’t yet have a warrant from the federal agents.
“When the St. Paul police started dispersing people and moving the line back, the agents then started shouting, “See, they’re leaving.","On Tuesday, Jeffrey Suazo woke up at 6 a.m. like he did every morning. He got ready for his work as a house painter, said goodbye to his girlfriend Deylin, and drove away, his family said.

But this morning was different in a key way — he left his house in the 600 block of Rose Avenue in St. Paul at the same time as Victor Rodriguez, a tenant from Honduras living on the first floor. Soon, Suazo found himself pursued by federal agents who were apparently looking for Rodriguez.

Suazo fled back home, his family said, prompting an hourslong standoff and drawing more than 200 protesters who clashed with federal agents and St. Paul police officers.

A day later, state and city officials have promised an investigation into how the operation devolved into a clash with law enforcement that led to tear-gas and other nonlethal munitions that sent at least one photojournalist to the hospital.

Federal immigration officials have filed a criminal complaint, charging Suazo with assaulting a federal officer. But confusion and questions still swirl around what exactly happened and why he was swept into the operation.

Family members spoke to Sahan Journal through a translator on Wednesday, sharing their account of what led to Suazo’s arrest. They asked to use their first names, citing safety concerns.

Suazo, 26, came to the United States four years ago from Honduras fleeing persecution. He had been living in the East Side house for a year with his girlfriend Deylin, her 6-year-old sister Siamy, their mother Maria, and his pregnant sister-in-law Daniela, family members said.

On Tuesday morning, he left for work in his car at the same time as Victor Rodriguez, a tenant from Honduras living on the first floor of the house. Soon after he left the house, Rodriguez was pursued and arrested by what Suazo described to Deylin and his sister-in-law Daniela as federal agents in three cars.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Rodriguez illegally entered the U.S. after being previously removed from the country and had previous charges of domestic abuse and disorderly conduct.

In a criminal complaint against Suazo filed after the federal operation Tuesday, ICE deportation officer Benjamin Jorgenson said agents were surveilling the Rose Avenue house when they saw Rodriguez leave around 7:45 a.m. and get into a white pickup truck. Suazo left at the same time and got into his Toyota Corolla, also parked outside.

Officers surrounded both vehicles in unmarked cars and turned on their flashers, the criminal complaint said. Suazo then squeezed past agents’ vehicles, leading Jorgenson to pursue him with lights flashing. A half-block later, Suazo “suddenly jerked his vehicle to the left, striking my vehicle,” Jorgenson said in the complaint.

Deylin said that during Rodriguez’s arrest, one of the agents from the three cars pointed at Suazo, who was dressed in his painter’s clothes. “That’s when he tried to find a way out,” she said.

Suazo drove back to the safety of his house, but was pursued by the three cars. He entered his garage through the back alley, where agents deliberately rammed his vehicle, Suazo told Deylin after he got into the house.

The family said soon after Suazo came into the house, the agents surrounded the house.

On his way in, Suazo forgot to lock one of the doors. At least two agents would later enter the first floor of the house, now vacant as Rodriguez was the only occupant, through that same door, the family said. “We started to hear the wooden floors creak and we could hear two voices from below,” said Daniela. “That’s when the manipulation tactics and the insults started,” she said.

According to their account, the agents tried to determine the number of people inside by calling out “Señora, señora.” They said the agents even mentioned Deylin’s 6-year-old sister Siamy, asking what the little girl would think when she returned from school.

They added that a male agent taunted Suazo in halting Spanish, calling him “poco hombre” for hiding and for putting his girlfriend at risk. “And just like mocking, you know, and singing, like in a horror movie, saying, ‘Jeffrey, come out, we’re gonna get you one way or another.’ That was nerve-wracking,” Daniela said. They added that a female agent said that they were arresting Suazo for missing his court date, but the family said that he did not have any ongoing court proceedings.

Suazo was in a room with Deylin while Daniela and Deylin’s mother, Maria, were in other rooms, communicating with each other and a team from the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC) through messages for advice. They were locked in their rooms for five hours without food, afraid to even use the bathroom.

They were watching from their window as more and more uniformed agents gathered on the street outside their house. “Jeffrey was scared,” Deylin said, “he started crying, and he was so scared to the point where he wanted to leave the house and give in to the officers.”

Over the next hour, dozens of neighbors and community organizers arrived to confront the federal agents. According to protestors, St. Paul police showed up to the scene a little after 10 a.m. and blocked the street to traffic. St Paul Council Vice President Hwa Jeong Kim said that one of the protestors was slammed on the sidewalk by St. Paul police, according to MPR. That person was taken to the backyard of the house along with two other protestors.

Suazo was told not to leave by legal advisers over the phone because the agents did not present a warrant. “They shouted through the stairs that they would say that Jeffrey was the one that crashed into the agents so that they could get a warrant,” Deylin said.

Even though the agents told the community organizers that they had a warrant for one person in the house, Suazo’s family said that their advocates didn’t yet have a warrant from the federal agents.

As scores showed up to protest the federal raid, St. Paul police closed off the perimeter in front of the house with yellow tape, using pepper spray to disperse protestors.

“When the St. Paul police started dispersing people and moving the line back, the agents then started shouting, “See, they’re leaving. They don’t care about you guys, they’re just here to put on a show,” Deylin said. “I was really scared.”

Daniela and Maria added that they were worried the agents would break in. “I was worried for my daughter, worried for everybody in the house,” Maria said. “What if they just forcibly come in? What if they break the doors? What do we do?”

At a Wednesday news conference held at St. Paul nonprofit Indigenous Roots, Executive Director Mary Anne Ligeralde Quiroz said agents had threatened to throw pepper balls into the house and break open the doors.

On Tuesday, Quiroz and acquaintances of the family were communicating with a Homeland Security Task Force officer. The officer said they would leave the rest of the family unharmed if Suazo turned himself in.

“I can’t say it’s this one, but normally, like, if we were to come into contact with somebody that doesn’t have status here, that would be a club-in situation,” the officer told Quiroz. “If that person freely comes out, they will not touch the rest of the family,” Tanisha Santiago, a relative of the family, said.

Daniela said that Jeffrey spoke to a lawyer over the phone. “That was the window of time to be able to leave the premises,” she said.

Deylin, who has been in a relationship with Suazo for five years and knows him from Honduras, said she wanted to go with him. “It was just a very intense, heavy, intimate moment for them,” Daniela said on Deylin’s behalf. “She was crying on the floor. She was distraught,” she said.

Before turning himself in, Suazo hugged each one of them goodbye, including his two cats.

After five hours of fear, anxiety, and uncertainty, Suazo was escorted out of the house at midday by federal agents, followed by two protestors who were also detained.

Suazo’s family never expected that immigration agents would one day knock on their door. “We had only ever heard about it at businesses and public spaces, we had never heard that agents were actually forcing their way into people’s homes,” Daniela and Maria said. “It was like a real shock in a moment of being checked into reality as to what’s going on,” Maria added.

Deylin knows Suazo to be a loving, caring partner. He is also the breadwinner of the house.

“He is just really important to the household,” Daniela said. “He is someone who has no vices, he’s not on the streets causing trouble or hanging out with people. He goes to work and comes home and does everything together as a family. If they need to go wash clothes, they all go to the laundromat together. He is such a pillar in the household because we don’t work, and so he was the one who would help pay for things, you know, like, ‘Do you guys want food? Let’s all get food together.'”

The family is now raising money for Suazo’s legal assistance. They hope that Suazo comes back home without charges, and is met with justice.

“They are painting Jeffrey as something he’s not. They’re calling him somebody who’s violated somebody like, plastering his face, coming out [of the house] crying… We want to make sure Jeffrey’s life and who he is is heard and that his name is not sullied, and portrayed as who he is, as we know him,” Daniela said.

“We also just want to be in a house that’s safe,” Maria said. “We want to be somewhere where we don’t have the fear that this is going to happen again, because we don’t feel safe in our house right now.”

The court supported her appeal to reject an immigration tribunal ruling that had allowed a Palestinian family to come to the UK under a scheme meant for Ukrainian refugees.
This protects the right to a family life.
The Appeal Court ruling could have a far-reaching impact because it will become case law cited by government lawyers and immigration tribunals in future cases.
New restrictions on use of Article 8 right to family life will mean only immediate family will count in order to prevent “dubious” connections.","Shabana Mahmood has overturned a human rights ruling that granted Palestinians fleeing Gaza refuge in Britain.

In a victory for the Government, Mahmood has been backed by the Court of Appeal in restricting the ability of migrants to use the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to come and live in the UK.

The court supported her appeal to reject an immigration tribunal ruling that had allowed a Palestinian family to come to the UK under a scheme meant for Ukrainian refugees.

The family had successfully argued that their circumstances were so exceptional that they should be allowed to enter the UK and live with the father’s brother under the scheme.

This was despite warnings from lawyers for the Home Office that such a decision could open the floodgates to the “admission of all those in conflict zones with family in the UK”.

The Appeal Court judges, including Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, ruled that the family links between the brothers were not strong enough to justify their entry to the UK under Article 8 of the ECHR. This protects the right to a family life.

The court also said that immigration tribunals must take account of the Home Secretary’s rights under Article 8 to act in the interests of “the economic well-being of the country … or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”.

The Appeal Court ruling could have a far-reaching impact because it will become case law cited by government lawyers and immigration tribunals in future cases.

The case, first highlighted by The Telegraph in February, sparked a row between Sir Keir Starmer and Baroness Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, when she rebuked him and Kemi Badenoch for criticising the original tribunal decision backing the family at Prime Minister’s Questions.

The Palestinian family, who had a “anti-Hamas profile”, were trapped in Gaza in “extremely dangerous” conditions where law and order had broken down and were living in a tent that had been damaged by gunfire.

They used the Ukraine Family Scheme form because the Home Office guidance told claimants to apply “for the route which most closely matches [your] circumstances”.

An upper immigration tribunal ruled that the rights of the family, who were in an “extreme and life-threatening” situation, outweighed the “public interest” of the rules on entry to the UK, which were designed to limit resettlement schemes and control immigration.

In its judgment, however, the Court of Appeal said the purpose of Article 8 was normally limited to the “nuclear” family and that there was not “family life” between the two brothers unless they could demonstrate “additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties”.

New restrictions on use of Article 8

The Appeal Court judges said the immigration tribunals had been wrong to ask themselves only whether the sponsor had provided “real, effective or committed support” to his brother and the family.

They concluded that the family links were not covered by Article 8 rights. “Applying the proper test, neither the brother nor his family had demonstrated that they had sufficient family life with the sponsor to engage Article 8,” they said.

The judgment comes as Ms Mahmood is preparing new laws to limit the way immigration courts use Article 8 in determining whether to block deportations or back asylum appeals.

New restrictions on use of Article 8 right to family life will mean only immediate family will count in order to prevent “dubious” connections. Judges will be required to prioritise public safety over individual article eight rights.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/11/26/TELEMMGLPICT000450611400_17641869093630_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gmyy-GsNrhPQbLesooHneHs.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-11-27 10:57:28.302889

The Virginia Beach Police Department confirmed the arrests in a statement and Chief Paul Neudigate called the allegations “incredibly alarming.”","Two brothers in Virginia have been arrested after an off-duty police officer overheard the men allegedly discussing plans to kill immigration officers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday.

John Wilson Bennett and Mark Booth Bennett, both U.S. citizens, were arrested late last week on allegations they were planning to carry out attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the department announcement said.

It said the department began an investigation Nov. 17 with the Virginia Beach Police Department after an off-duty Norfolk, Virginia, police officer reported he heard the brothers allegedly discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.”

Mark Bennett also was overheard allegedly saying he was going to Las Vegas to meet with other people to purchase firearms to carry out the attacks, according to the department statement. It said Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at the Norfolk International Airport, where he was set to fly to Las Vegas. Later that day, it said, John Bennett, an assistant principal at Kempsville High School, was arrested in Virginia Beach.

Both of the men were charged with “conspiracy to commit malicious wounding,” according to court records.

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

The brothers and their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.

During a hearing last week in a court in Virginia Beach General District Court, their attorneys said the conversation was hearsay and that the brothers posed no threat to the community, according to Virginia news outlet 13 News Now. The attorneys said Mark Bennett was traveling to Las Vegas for a Formula 1 race before he was apprehended at the Norfolk airport, according to the news report.

They were released on home confinement under pretrial supervision, according to the news report.

McLaughlin’s statement highlighted what she described as a sharp increase in assaults and death threats against immigration officers, including cases of bounties being placed on their heads, threats to their families, stalking and online doxxing.

The arrest comes at a time of heightened tension in the country over federal immigration enforcement.

Homeland Security officials have ramped up enforcement actions under President Donald Trump’s sweeping anti-immigrant crackdown highlighted by mass arrests, including the targeting of Democratic-run cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles for sweeping operations.

The agency advised them to use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection CBP Home mobile application to report their departure from the United States.

""This secure and convenient self-deportation process includes a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and potential future opportunities for legal immigration to the United States,"" DHS said.

Haiti was first granted TPS in 2010 after an earthquake and has been repeatedly extended or redesignated by successive administrations.

VIOLENT CRIMINAL GANGS HAVE 'NEAR-TOTAL CONTROL' OF WORLD NATION'S CAPITAL, UN SAYS

Former President Joe Biden’s administration extended TPS for Haitians in 2024, citing ""simultaneous economic, security, political, and health crises"" in the country fueled by gangs and a lack of a functioning government. That extension lasts through Feb. 3, 2026.

Haiti has been in turmoil for years, with natural disasters and political violence rocking the Caribbean nation.

Governance effectively collapsed in 2021 with the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, leaving power vacuums. Kidnappings, gang rule and a lack of law enforcement have surged.

The number of people displaced by violence and instability in Haiti has reached an unprecedented level, with more than 1.4 million people forced from their homes this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.

UNICEF, according to the DHS notice, estimated in October that more than 6 million people — over half the population, including 3.3 million children — need humanitarian assistance.

Some Haitians have attempted to flee to the U.S. despite the Trump administration’s hardline approach to immigration. For instance, in February, the Coast Guard intercepted 132 Haitians on a boat south of the Florida Keys. The Coast Guard boarded the 30-foot vessel and processed the migrants before they were repatriated to Haiti, officials said.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/haitian-migrants.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 11:58:17.646206

The US has suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, after an Afghan man was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the decision was made pending a review of ""security and vetting protocols"".

The suspect of Wednesday's shooting, which left two National Guard members critically injured, is said to have arrived in the US from Afghanistan in September 2021.

US President Donald Trump said the attack was an ""act of terror"", adding that he would take steps to remove foreigners ""from any country who does not belong here"".

Tens of thousands of Afghans entered the US under special immigration protections following the chaotic US withdrawal from the country in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.

The Department of Homeland Security named the suspect in a press release as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, ""a criminal alien from Afghanistan"".

It said Lakanwal had entered the US during the presidency of Joe Biden in September 2021, under a programme for Afghans named called Operation Allies Welcome.

At the time, the Taliban had taken back control of Afghanistan following a chaotic withdrawal of US forces.

An official told the BBC's US news partner CBS that Lakanwal had applied for asylum in 2024, and that his application had been granted earlier this year.

Lakanwal's is reportedly 29 years old, and he is said to not be co-operating with authorities' investigation.

Trump said following the shooting that the US ""must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden"".

The Joint Task Force DC, which is co-ordinating the National Guard deployments to the nation's capital, said the attack took place at around 14:15 EST (19:15 GMT) on Wednesday near the Farragut Square Metro Station.

The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets - a busy lunch spot for office workers.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect ""came around the corner"" and ""immediately started firing"", adding that the soldiers had been ""ambushed"".

Other National Guard members nearby heard the gunfire and intervened, holding the suspect down until police arrived, he said.

The suspect was shot four times, law enforcement sources told CBS.

One witness described to the BBC his experience of hearing gunshots, as people ran in panic and tried to take shelter in a nearby shop.

Another witness, who was in his car close to the metro station, showed the BBC footage he took of the two soldiers lying on the street in their uniforms while being treated by medics. Details on the identities of the soldiers have not yet been provided by officials.

A third person, apparently the alleged gunman, was also seen on the pavement being treated.

In the wake of the attack, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked him to send 500 more National Guard members to the American capital.

""This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington DC safe and beautiful,"" the Pentagon chief said.

There are currently nearly 2,200 National Guard troops in the city.

They are a reservist force that can be activated to serve as military troops, but have limited power as they cannot enforce the law or make arrests.

The troops were deployed in August to tackle what Trump called ""out of control"" crime in Washington.

Overall crime in the city has fallen since the force was sent, which Trump credits to the troops' presence on the streets.

There have been similar deployments in other Democratic-led cities across the US, which have faced legal challenges by opponents who accuse the Trump administration of overreach.

“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said in a post on the social media platform X.

“The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the agency added.

President Trump on Wednesday night ordered his administration to review the cases of individuals from Afghanistan who entered the country after the U.S. withdrawal from the Middle Eastern country in 2021.

The shooting suspect, Rahmanaullah Lakanwal, 29, entered the United States in September 2021 through the program “Operation Allies Welcome,” DHS said Wednesday night. At the time, the Biden administration ordered DHS to help vulnerable Afghans who worked with American troops during the 20-year war in Afghanistan resettle in the U.S. after the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021.

In a short speech from his Mar-a-Lago property Wednesday night, Trump lambasted former President Biden for the program and called him “a disastrous president.” Vice President Vance echoed the president’s sentiment in a post on the social media platform X hours later.

“I remember back in 2021 criticizing the Biden policy of opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,” Vance said. “Friends sent me messages calling me a racist. It was a clarifying moment. They shouldn’t have been in our country.”

Around 195,000 Afghan immigrants live in the U.S. as of 2022, with the majority living in Washington, D.C. and Sacramento, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

Before the shooting, the Trump administration on Tuesday ordered USCIS to “re-interview” some 200,000 refugees who entered the country, according to a memo obtained by The Hill. The memo suggested that refugees’ protections could be stripped.

“All principal refugees admitted during this period are to undergo a comprehensive review and a re-interview to verify that, at the time of their admission, they met the statutory definition of a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act,” the memo stated. “Officers must also reassess any inadmissibility issues that existed at the time of admission.”

Trump renewed his push after the shooting left two National Guardsmen in critical condition. At around 2:15 p.m., they were shot near the Farragut Square Metro Station in the area of 17th and I streets NW, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) stated.

Both Guard members were “ambushed” after a person turned the corner, raised his arm and fired with a handgun, Jeffrey Carroll, executive assistant chief of the MPD, said at a press conference. Both Guard members were taken to a nearby hospital.

Lakanwal was also shot and taken to the hospital. He remains in custody.

Trump called the shooting “an act of terror.” He called on Americans to pray for the two Guardsmen and said the suspect would pay “the steepest possible price.”

“As we are filled with anguish and grief for those who were shot, we’re also filled with righteous anger and ferocious resolve,” the president said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the FBI is investigating the shooting with the assistance of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), DHS, the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP25330764715554-e1764194379721.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-27 11:58:23.598760

The cable, first reported by the New York Times and seen by Reuters, frames mass migration as a threat to public safety and social cohesion and urges embassies to report back on migrant-related crimes and host-country reactions. This aligns with Trump’s hardline immigration agenda: slashing refugee admissions, promoting global rollbacks to asylum protections, and amplifying claims contradicted by studies that migrants drive violent crime.

Why It Matters

The directive pushes U.S. immigration ideology into allied domestic politics, marking an aggressive attempt to reshape Western migration frameworks that have stood since WWII. It risks diplomatic friction with governments that support humanitarian migration or rely on migrant labor, and could further polarize debates on crime, asylum, and integration across the West.

The Trump administration is seeking to internationalize its restrictive migration model; U.S. diplomats are now tasked with lobbying allied governments on a politically charged issue; European, Canadian, and Australian officials face new U.S. pressure that may conflict with their own laws, data, and public sentiment; migrant and refugee communities could face heightened stigma as governments respond to U.S. messaging that links them to crime.

What’s Next

Expect pushback from some allies wary of U.S. interference in their migration policies, alongside possible political amplification from right-wing parties who see Washington’s stance as validation. Embassies will begin sending crime-related reporting to Washington, which may be used to justify further U.S. policy tightening. The global debate over asylum and refugee frameworks will likely intensify as the administration attempts to align partners with its hardline approach.

Third, the Court afforded States an excessively wide margin of appreciation, setting an unduly high threshold for proving a violation under A3P1.
This case invites the Grand Chamber to ensure that the Convention continues to offer real, enforceable protection for free and fair elections.","In the recent judgment of Bradshaw & Others v United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has sent a powerful message to governments across Europe: democratic rights in the digital age require active protection—not just of the voting process, but of the entire information environment in which elections take place.

The case was brought by former MPs Ben Bradshaw, Caroline Lucas and Alyn Smith represented by Leigh Day solicitors. They argued that the UK Government had failed to investigate credible allegations of Russian interference in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the 2016 Brexit vote, and the 2019 general election, including evidence from the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament set out in the Russia Report. This, they said, breached the UK’s positive obligations under Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (A3P1) — the right to free and fair elections.

The Court did not shy away from acknowledging Russia’s systematic efforts to destabilise democratic systems across Europe and the United States, using tactics such as media manipulation, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns. The Court emphasised that “the dissemination of disinformation is capable of posing a significant threat to democracy.

The ECtHR ultimately found no violation of A3P1. It accepted that there were initial shortcomings in the UK’s response—and it is notable that the full Russia Report has still not been released.

However, the Court held that steps taken by the UK - including two parliamentary investigations and the introduction of legislation such as the Elections Act 2022 and the National Security Act 2023—fell within the “margin of appreciation” afforded to States. The judgment also sets a new precedent that foreign interference in elections can in principle engage A3P1, with the Court holding that “States are therefore under an obligation to adopt positive measures to organise elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people.”

The Court made clear that this obligation is not confined to the act of voting or the integrity of the final count. It encompasses the entire ecosystem in which elections take place—including the circulation of political opinions and information in the period preceding an election and the equality of opportunity for candidates.

While acknowledging the right to a free and fair election, the Court warns against kneejerk reactions noting that there is a fine line between addressing the dangers of disinformation and outright censorship. Any actions taken by States to counter the risk of foreign election interference will need to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.

Looking Ahead

This case began with events in 2014. It has taken several years to reach Strasbourg, and in that time, the landscape of digital interference has grown only more complex. Social media platforms have evolved, AI-generated content is proliferating, and the pace of technological change continues to outrun the ability of lawmakers to respond. Foreign actors are increasingly exploiting these developments to influence public opinion, distort democratic debate, and undermine electoral integrity—often without detection, and often from thousands of miles away.

The ECtHR did not elaborate what specific actions States must take to protect its democratic elections from foreign interference – and indeed it would be difficult to do so given the diversity of threats. However, it concludes that “this is a complex global problem which cannot be addressed without the co-operation of international partners and social media companies.” The Bradshaw judgment sets a clear challenge for the UK government—and for governments across Europe.

This is not the end of the story. The applicants have now requested a referral to the Grand Chamber, arguing that this is an exceptional case raising serious questions about the interpretation or application of the Convention. The applicants argue that the Court’s judgment requires further consideration by the Grand Chamber in respect of three issues

First, the Court failed to recognise a freestanding obligation to investigate credible allegations of foreign interference with the right to free and fair elections. While the judgment acknowledged that States have a positive duty to safeguard electoral integrity, it did not require States to investigate such claims. Without a clear investigative obligation, the right to participate in elections under conditions ensuring free expression risks being theoretical and illusory only.

Second, the Court failed to clarify the scope of States’ positive obligations under A3P1.

Third, the Court afforded States an excessively wide margin of appreciation, setting an unduly high threshold for proving a violation under A3P1.

This case invites the Grand Chamber to ensure that the Convention continues to offer real, enforceable protection for free and fair elections. The outcome will shape how States respond to hostile threats against democracy - and whether voters can rely on the Convention to defend their right to choose their representatives without manipulation or foreign interference.",https://www.leighday.co.uk/media/cnwblxu4/gettyimages-496704430.jpg?width=800&height=480,N,,2025-11-27 12:57:48.877428

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees U.S. immigration, made the announcement on social media late Wednesday. The two Guard members from West Virginia were in critical condition after a 29-year-old man from Afghanistan shot them, officials said. The man, who was also injured, entered the United States in 2021 under a Biden-era immigration program for Afghans leaving their country after the government fell to the Taliban.

“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” the agency said on social media. “The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission.”

Earlier in the evening, President Trump had said in a speech after the attack that “we must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan.”

The immigration pause will impact Afghan nationals trying to remain in the United States by seeking asylum or obtaining a green card, among other immigration benefits extended by the agency.

It will also affect Afghans who helped the U.S. government during the 20-year war in Afghanistan and had applied to be relocated to the United States through the Special Immigrant Visa program.

Many applicants have yet to reach the United States and remain stranded in third countries or in hiding in Afghanistan. The Trump administration’s decision to accept no more than 7,500 refugees from around the world for the fiscal year that started last month will not help them.

“The S.I.V. program was one of the few remaining pathways” for Afghans seeking a way out of their country, said Mevlude Akay Alp, a senior staff attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project, a nonprofit based in New York. “And it’s unsure if even this will continue.”

The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated in 2022 that there were nearly 200,000 Afghan immigrants in the U.S., with the biggest populations living in the Washington, D.C., and Sacramento, Calif., areas.

Resettlements of Afghans have been in free fall since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. In 2024, roughly 3,100 Afghan refugees were resettled in the United States each month. From January to May of this year, those arrivals plummeted by nearly two-thirds.

In July, the Trump administration withdrew humanitarian protections for Afghans already resettled in the United States, citing Afghanistan’s “improved security situation and its stabilizing economy.”

More than half of Afghanistan’s 42 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. More than two million have returned, often without savings or housing, after being expelled from Iran and Pakistan.

Afghanistan is also facing a looming conflict with neighboring Pakistan, which has hit its two largest cities and border areas with airstrikes in recent weeks.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/26/multimedia/26dc-shooting-live-afghan-immigration-pfhg/26dc-shooting-live-afghan-immigration-pfhg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 07:58:41.135425

ICE Tracker

We’re tracking immigration enforcement in Santa Cruz County.

Stay informed with the latest data.

ICE Tracker

SANTA CRUZ COUNTY >> Federal immigration agents entered the county at least 24 times since Jan. 25, including three visits last month, according to records of calls to local law enforcement.

As the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency draws to a close, uncertainty remains about the local effects of a nationwide surge in immigration enforcement. To combat misinformation and fear, Santa Cruz Local is tracking federal immigration enforcement in Santa Cruz County with records of “courtesy calls” to local law enforcement.

Federal law enforcement will often, but not always, give a heads up when operations are planned to avoid potentially dangerous confusion if the agents are unknown to local police.

Santa Cruz Local is filing ongoing public records requests with all five law enforcement agencies in Santa Cruz County to keep track of these notifications from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or any other agency carrying out immigration enforcement. This tracker will be updated as records are provided.

What the records show

ICE visited Watsonville, the City of Santa Cruz, and areas of the county outside of cities eight times each between Jan. 25 and Oct. 25 this year, according to notifications to local law enforcement. Most notifications were in the early morning, between 5 and 5:30 a.m., and often ICE reported they were leaving the area by 10 a.m. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that includes border patrol, did not report any activity in the county.

Local law enforcement officials have said they do not cooperate with immigration enforcement and California law prohibits any such collaboration.

ICE officials often went to the same address multiple times, and said they were surveilling the area. On some occasions, separate teams of agents visited different areas of the county on the same day. The records don’t include information about who ICE is looking for, or if they arrested or detained anyone. Officials may have visited without notifying local law enforcement.

Agents were in groups of two to seven, with two to four cars. The cars range in make and model, but were often Hyundai, Nissan or Dodge models.

How to prepare for immigration enforcement

Know your rights.

If approached by immigration enforcement:

You have the right to remain silent.

You do not have to open your door for immigration officials or law enforcement unless presented with a judicial warrant — that means it’s signed by a judge.

You have the right to see a lawyer before signing documents, although if arrested by immigration enforcement you do not have the right to a public defender.

Businesses have a right to decline immigration officers access to private areas, unless the agents have a judicial warrant.

Make a plan.

People at risk of immigration enforcement can plan for possible arrest, detention or deportation.

Memorize the phone number for an emergency contact, like a family member or attorney.

Ensure emergency contacts have your immigration number (A-number) to help find you if you are detained or arrested. An ICE locator can search for detainees by name or immigration number, but the information may be delayed.

Make sure a trusted friend or family number has copies of your documents in case of detention.

Parents can fill out a child care safety plan with details of who will care for their children in case a parent is arrested, deported or otherwise needs help.

Review our full ICE tracker, it will be updated each month.

St. Paul leaders respond to ICE operation

Big picture view:

Members of the St. Paul City Council are calling for an audit into the public cost of the police department's actions during the raid as well as an investigation into the department's adherence to the separation ordinance.

The separation ordinance prohibits local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration law.

Council members say they also want an investigation into the St. Paul Police Department's use of force, which included pepper balls, less-lethal munitions and chemical irritants.

Dig deeper:

After a federal operation on Lake Street in June, the Minneapolis City Auditor found that Minneapolis officers did not violate the city's separation ordinance when they assisted with crowd control.

What they're saying:

St. Paul City Council Member Nelsie Yang, who represents Ward 6, where the raid happened, said the St. Paul Police Department must be investigated for its role during the raid.

""First and foremost, ICE has no place in our city. Second, I am deeply horrified by the way our Saint Paul police officers conducted themselves yesterday,"" Yang said. ""What we witnessed from SPPD was not reflective of our values in safety for all. It speaks volumes about the growth edges in SPPD and the need to act with humility by learning from our community about what fighting fascism looks like rather than being complicit in it.""

St. Paul City Council President Rebecca Noecker shared the following statement:

""Yesterday’s events raise serious concerns about the use of force by our police officers and the integrity of our separation ordinance. Every resident of Saint Paul, regardless of immigration status, deserves to feel safe and protected by local law enforcement. My colleagues and I are committed to a full, transparent investigation into what happened, including a review of adherence to our separation ordinance and SPPD’s use of force policies. We are committed to taking any steps necessary to strengthen oversight and accountability for the department.""

St. Paul City Council Vice President HwaJeong Kim says he was present during the operation and released this statement:

""I’m enraged by the lack of de-escalation and care by our Police Department. Yesterday, I witnessed our officers fire indiscriminately at the press and community members, injuring several. We were tear gassed, pepper sprayed in the face and hit with lower lethals. To be clear, ANY release of chemical weapons, especially in a residential neighborhood, should be banned regardless of whether it’s federal or local law enforcement. It’s also clear our separation ordinance and our use of force policy don’t go far enough in protecting residents. Demands for policy change, transparency, and accountability need to be acted on by this council. Time and time again, our police department has shown a clear disregard for residents and their right to protest. Their level of posturing and escalation is all too familiar to communities of color, activists, and organizers.""

St. Paul Police Federation response

The other side:

The St. Paul Police Federation shared the following statement:

""Yesterday morning, federal agents executing a warrant were assaulted, threatened, and blocked by a violent mob. They called us for help. We responded only to protest lives and restore order - nothing more. We do not do immigration enforcement. Never have, never will.

""A core of professional agitators refused every order, attacked officers with frozen bottles and rocks, damaged patrol cars, and shouted 'Don't let them leave.' Our officers while being assaulted, used the absolute minimum force necessary to end the threat and get everyone home safe.

""Not one rioter was seriously injured. Several officers were struck by projectiles, yet every one of them showed extraordinary discipline and courage.

""This is not about politics.

""This is about public safety.

""We are not your adversary.

""We are your police.

""When the next mob comes, please stand with us - not against us.

Our community deserves nothing less.""

Melvin Carter responds to ICE raid

Mayor statement:

St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter shared the following statement:

""The injuries sustained by journalists during Tuesday’s ICE-related incident are troubling. Reporters play a vital role in telling our community’s story with clarity and accuracy, particularly in moments when reliable information is scarce. When they are harmed while doing so, it jeopardizes public trust and the very freedoms our community deserves.

""The conduct we saw yesterday was jarring. I have directed a thorough review of all Saint Paul police body-worn camera footage be done in a timely manner to understand exactly what happened and ensure full transparency and accountability.

""Saint Paul must remain a place where transparency is valued, civil liberties are upheld, and those who document our community can do their work safely. I am committed to ensuring the safety of all members of our community.""

What's next:

St. Paul City Council members say they will formally initiate the separation ordinance and use-of-force investigations as well as the public cost audit during the raid during their next meeting on Dec. 3.

Those investigations will be carried out by the Police Civilian Internal Affairs Review Commission, council members say.

The backstory:

A large crowd gathered in a St. Paul neighborhood the morning of Tuesday, Nov. 26, amid a federal law enforcement operation that protesters believed was an ICE raid.

St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry released an update via YouTube shortly after the operation. He said his department was made aware of federal agents working a detail on the 600 block of Rose Avenue, and were called to assist when protesters broke the perimeter made by federal agents. Various law enforcement officers intervened, so protesters could express their first amendment rights, and federal agents could do their jobs, the chief said.

Chief Henry added that reports indicated protesters were arming themselves with rocks and sticks. That prompted additional officers to respond to secure the scene.

Federal authorities involved included ICE agents and a U.S. Marshals task force. Protesters held signs and called out anti-ICE chants as investigators worked inside a home.

Agents were on the scene at least through 11 a.m. Tuesday, but cleared the scene starting around 12:30 p.m.

As they left, police used tear gas to clear protesters who were blocking vehicles in the street.

Homeland Security officials say they were working with a detail to arrest Victor Molina Rodriguez, a Honduran who had previously been deported. Rodriguez has previous convictions for domestic abuse and disorderly conduct. DHS officials say he committed a felony by illegally re-entering the U.S.

During the arrest, Homeland Security officials say a U.S. citizen used a vehicle as a weapon and rammed into an ICE law enforcement vehicle. The suspect fled on foot, but was later taken into custody.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/image2025-11-25-12h15m22s183.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-27 09:56:47.941884

""ICE enforces immigration law against all unlawfully present aliens – criminal history is not a prerequisite for enforcement.
Shasteen said after his wife's arrest, the immigration officer then gave him a business card with a QR code.
“The law clearly allows her to file for a green card through a U.S. citizen spouse,” he said.
“I just feel like I lost another wife,” Shasteen said.","As ICE continues to arrest people in San Diego during their green card interviews, the final step in a legal pathway, some of the people taken into custody have been spouses of military members and veterans, including one who said he felt “betrayed” after serving for decades in the U.S. Marine Corps.

ICE has repeatedly said these arrests, which began Nov. 12, are for overstaying visas. But multiple immigration attorneys contend that’s never been an issue before, with an exception in federal law for direct relatives of U.S. citizens, including spouses, who are going through the green card process.

“I kind of feel betrayed, to be honest,” said Samuel Shasteen, a retired Staff Sergeant who said he spent 20 years with the Marines, including two deployments to Afghanistan. “We do everything that we can to protect and serve our country. And then they betray us by treating us like we've never done anything.”

Shasteen lost his wife to cancer in 2022. Months later, on a break from work, he says he walked into a coffee shop in downtown San Diego and saw Chanidaphon Sopimpa, who stitched his broken heart back together again.

“It kind of felt like there wasn’t a hole there no more. She just filled a spot, the void that was there,” Shasteen said.

His kids were wary at first, but Shasteen said that quickly changed and two years later, they were married. Originally from Thailand, he said she did overstay her visa, but they’ve been trying to get her green card since the wedding.

On Nov. 18, they had her final interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Shasteen said “everything seemed great” until the end, when ICE agents came in, handcuffed his wife and took her away as she cried.

“Any other time in U.S. history, it would have been approved,” said Shasteen’s attorney Derek Poulsen. “It really is just a straightforward case.”

""All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,"" ICE said in a statement in response to previous inquiries on this tactic. ""ICE enforces immigration law against all unlawfully present aliens – criminal history is not a prerequisite for enforcement. Being unlawfully present in the United States is itself a violation of federal law. This activity reflects ICE’s renewed focus on executing final orders, addressing public-safety threats, and reducing absconder population consistent with law.""

Shasteen said after his wife's arrest, the immigration officer then gave him a business card with a QR code.

“She says, ‘Scan this, it will answer all your questions on what you need to do next,’ and I scanned it and it just made me more frustrated because it was just like ICE propaganda,” he said.

“When we do our immigration papers, it asks you if you’re military,” Shasteen continued. “Everything that you upload for documents shows you’re part of the military, or your service. So they know. It’s just – why are they doing it this way? I don’t know.”

His wife was taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center. When he visits her, Shasteen says he wears a shirt showing his service and has had others come up to him and share that they’re in the military as well. Shasteen said he’s started a support group for the people he’s met in the same situation.

“To me, it kind of feels like a bond that I built with my fellow Marines when I was over in Afghanistan,” he said. “You know, we're out there to fight the enemy, and we come together no matter where we're from and fight.”

Immigration attorney William Menard said his client is Australian, the wife of a Navy veteran and was arrested the same way, the same day.

“He put a lot of work into representing this country, and we did everything the right way,” Menard said. “I could hear him kind of muttering like, you know, ‘I served the country’ and kind of, ‘This is what I get.’”

For them, some good news came Wednesday: an immigration judge ordered her released on bond. In a support letter to the judge, a friend wrote that she “admires this country, its opportunities, and its core values,” while another wrote that she “couldn’t be prouder to be married to a U.S. veteran and on her path to permanent residency.”

Menard said she is still eligible for – and they will continue to pursue – her green card.

“The law clearly allows her to file for a green card through a U.S. citizen spouse,” he said.

“You’ve got to wonder what eight days of detention, what purpose that served. I don’t know,” Menard continued, adding that he’s done these interviews for over 12 years and never before seen an arrest like this.

He and Shasteen both said the women have no criminal history.

“I just feel like I lost another wife,” Shasteen said. “It feels horrible, you know, I just felt like they ripped something from me again. And to feel that way is not really how I ever wanted to feel again.”

Shasteen said his wife has a bond hearing next month. As he waits, he said his son – who years ago, had to warm up to her – has been avoiding the house.

“He texted me to tell me, ‘Dad I'm sorry I haven't been home,'"" Shasteen said. ""And he told me what it was reminding him of, which was his mom passing, and he didn't want to be home because he doesn’t want to be in an empty house without her.”

“One of the hardest parts of this current situation is the parallels I see every time I lay my head down to sleep at night,” his son wrote a letter to support her release. “I lay staring at the ceiling feeling hopeless and praying that she is okay, the same way I did when my mother was in the ICU fighting for her life.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/11/samuel-shasteen.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-27 03:56:45.333779

In the MAGA version of the immigration courts, there is no deliberation, there is only the inking and thumping of rubber stamps that say REMOVAL ORDER.
This isn’t even the first time that the DOJ has been found to use political litmus tests to hire immigration judges.
Immigration judges play a fundamental role in making these determinations, typically involving complex cases and sympathetic (but not always qualifying) stories on overwhelming deadlines.
Some judges have spent their career on the bench acting as deportation judges already.","After months of maliciously firing immigration judges whose adjudication records do not explicitly embrace the White House’s official position of hostility toward the American legal system, Trump’s Department of Justice is now actively recruiting lawyers who are willing to trade professional integrity for a chance at rubber-stamping deportation orders.

In the past few days, the DOJ began a hiring campaign for immigration judges featuring a new webpage, a not-so-subtle nod to the larger project of racial nationalism, and the egregious misrepresentation of immigration judges as “deportation judges.”

The subversion of whatever was left of our immigration system is punctuated by moments of symbolic clarity which are worth more than a passing offense. This is one of those moments.

The casual but informative falsehood that “immigration judges” are “deportation judges” is consistent with the debasement of our most serious democratic institutions and the politicization of our courts—but it’s more than that: it’s a constitutive misrepresentation, a lie that is not available for correction because it is not accidental and its intent is not simply to mislead or to reframe, but to accelerate and legitimize the reconstitution of the immigration courts as deportation factories and judges as mindless functionaries. This is not necessarily true of many immigration judges currently on the bench who remain and do their work with a deep sense of integrity and a commitment to rule of law, but this recruitment page says a lot about the next wave of hirings.

To call an immigration judge a “deportation judge” is to declare, at the outset, that the position requires not adjudication but preordination, and in doing so, entirely negates the term “judge” as a person who attempts to address heavy case-specific questions of facts and law in the form of an authentic decision. Only a lawyer who despises the law and resents the intellectual responsibilities that the legal profession appropriately imposes on them would be moved to apply now for such a shamelessly subordinate position. EOIR Director Margolin isn’t hiring judges—he’s hiring henchmen.

If the slippage in terms were accidental rather than intention, we might call it parapraxis, since it transparently discloses a more authentic version of how the Trump administration views immigration judges. The reconstitution of the courts is already visible in the data. Since January, the rate of asylum denials in court has risen to 80 percent—the highest national rate for which we have data. Many courts have higher local denial rates (e.g., Atlanta, Omaha, Houston), but usually these are balanced out at the national level by more liberal courts (e.g., San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles). They won’t be satisfied until everyone except white Afrikaners are denied asylum.

And it’s not just denial rates that matter, it’s also the volume of cases closed. Due to a deluge of new policies, immigration judges are shoveling asylum cases and other removal cases out the door with little attention to detail or due process, often so that those same immigrants can be arrested on the spot in court or shortly after while going about their everyday lives. This has resulted in the first major decline in the immigration court backlog since anyone has started tracking it, but it’s all at the expense of basic fairness and justice. As I wrote recently, it’s an asylum denial machine on steroids.

This is all by terrible design. For a small and willfully misinformed subset of society, immigration law has always been, and will always be, a mere technical operation with deportation as its only legitimate outcome. In the MAGA version of the immigration courts, there is no deliberation, there is only the inking and thumping of rubber stamps that say REMOVAL ORDER. To them, every deportation order is rightly decided and every asylum application granted is evidence of “fraud”—and no amount of empirical or logical evidence can complicate this doctrine for all the same reasons that cult members are unaffected by rational debate.

Like most things, Trump alone is not to blame for this predicament. Notwithstanding the institutional normalization of immigration judges since the 1970s, the independence, and therefore legitimacy, of the position of immigration judge has never been fully settled by Congress and never fully respected by the Executive. As the National Association of Immigration Judges have proclaimed, with admirable integrity and consistency, both Democrats and Republicans have toyed with immigration judges’ independence through a whiplash-inducing series of policy changes that shuffle court dockets around based on the political winds of the moment. This isn’t even the first time that the DOJ has been found to use political litmus tests to hire immigration judges.

And it’s not as if there haven’t been real solutions. The prospect of creating an independent court system has been on the table for years, most recently with Zoe Lofgren’s introduction of the “Real Courts, Real Rule of Law Act of 2024,” which would have potentially mitigated the DOJ’s ability to engage in politically motivated firing and hiring. An independent immigration court would not have solved all of the problems, and it would not necessarily have solved the backlog (which is all anyone seems to foolishly focus on), but it would have solved some of the more fundamental questions about the independence of the courts and would have partially insulated the courts from the kind of politicization that we see now. The fact that the legislation was too much for some people and too little for others prevented everyone from seeing it as an important and practical step in good governance. If we manage to hold onto democracy, the independence of the immigration courts is the kind of obvious next step we need to make happen so we can move on with this part of our collective lives.

Am I taking this DOJ job announcement too literally? Maybe. I am aware that the recruitment language smells like trolling, by which I mean, using the phrase “deportation judge” is, in part, intended as a kind of rage baiting that Trump and the MAGA base regularly deploy as a substitute to substantive public debate and critical thinking. For example, during the recent shutdown, government websites added banners that blamed Democrats (Hatch Act be damned) for the shutdown. And if you’re still wading in the cesspool formerly known as Twitter, you’ll know that official agency accounts have become fountains of misinformation, petty feuds, and unnecessary vitriol that has nothing to do with their mission and which undermines the professionalism of the civil servants who work there.

This precise example is just part of the takeover of our government’s digital infrastructure by a pathologically online class of rejects who have grown up idolizing YouTube conspiracy theorists, whatabouters, and sealioners who are incapable of sustained serious thought. The mini-Trumpers-slash-DOGE-tweens who, until recently, spent their pitiable young lives complaining about being rejected by women on Reddit and trolling in the comments of actual respected leaders, now run the social media accounts and official .gov websites of our major federal agencies, and, like the digital disease vectors that they are, are now infecting civil society with the same sycophantic behavior that could only ever achieve a dribble of acceptance in the putrid trenches of the MAGA movement. “Deportation judge,” they joked. “This’ll be hilarious.”

But it’s not funny. It’s quite serious. There are over 3 million people with pending removal cases in the immigration court system, and very many—if not most—of them came to the United States seeking humanitarian protection from conditions in the world that we, ourselves, helped to create in the first place. They did not all enter the country illegally even if they may well be ordered deported (the first is not a precondition for the second, as people often seem to forget). Their lives are worth deliberation, not premeditated dismissal.

Immigration judges play a fundamental role in making these determinations, typically involving complex cases and sympathetic (but not always qualifying) stories on overwhelming deadlines. I know many people who believe that to accept the robes and responsibilities of an immigration judge is to join the ranks of an institution that is fundamentally oppressive. That might be true. But after more than a decade of research on the immigration courts, I can also tell you that the immigration judges that I have come to know have helped me to understand their deep professional and personal commitment to delivering the best version of justice they know how within the constrained context of the courts. Some judges have spent their career on the bench acting as deportation judges already. But many judges view their position as one that requires that decisions of great gravity be met with great integrity.

The DOJ recruitment page for immigration judges undermines the integrity of the position both discursively, by belittling the position as a “deportation judge” (even if that is, in fact, what the administration is trying to do), and it sends a clear message that the performance standard for current and future judges is how many deportation orders they issue. This will be bad for the immigration courts and it will require drastic Congressional action at the next possible moment to undo the damage unfolding in front of us. In the short term, Congress should investigate these hiring practices.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0MwP!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe69ed1af-da6d-423a-8a49-02c4e4b62cde_1948x1472.png",N,,2025-11-27 07:58:44.192424

According to the lawsuit, the administration’s overhaul targets HUD’s Continuum of Care program, the primary federal pipeline that funds permanent supportive housing. As California Governor Gavin Newsom described in announcing his state’s participation in the suit, the administration is “slashing federal money for permanent housing and replacing it with transitional housing tied to work mandates or treatment requirements.”

According to the lawsuit, the administration’s overhaul targets HUD’s Continuum of Care program, the primary federal pipeline that funds permanent supportive housing. (TNND)

What States Say HUD Did Wrong

The suit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, argues that the administration violated federal law on several fronts. According to AG James’ office, more than $3 billion in federal homeless-services grants are at risk, potentially affecting over 170,000 people nationwide.

The complaint makes three core legal claims:

HUD exceeded its authority.

The rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act.

The administration infringed on Congress’s power of the purse.

The administration has defended the shift as part of a broader strategy emphasizing accountability and faster transitions out of homelessness. But the case now moves to federal court, where judges will determine whether HUD exceeded its authority.

Cities Crack Down With Camping Bans, But Do They Work?

A 2025 brief from the National Alliance to End Homelessness concluded that sweeps and camping bans do not reduce homelessness and often make it more difficult for people to secure stable housing. (TNND)

At the same time, the federal policy fight escalates, cities across the country have been rolling out new enforcement rules following last year’s Supreme Court decision allowing states to prohibit public camping. Curfews, encampment clearances, and expanded policing have now become more common and, in many places, have visibly reshaped streets and public spaces.

But experts say cleaner streets don’t necessarily mean fewer people experiencing homelessness.

A 2025 brief from the National Alliance to End Homelessness concluded that sweeps and camping bans do not reduce homelessness and often make it more difficult for people to secure stable housing. The brief cites repeated consequences: destroyed belongings, missed case-management appointments, and mounting fines or warrants.

Debate Over Housing First

The Trump administration has also sharply criticized the “Housing First” model, which prioritizes getting people into housing without requiring treatment or sobriety first. Critics argue the approach has been misapplied and turned into what they call “housing-only”, offering apartments but not enough mental health or addiction services.

A report from the Capital Research Center highlights California’s experience, pointing to a 47.1% increase in unsheltered homelessness after the state required all homelessness funding to go to Housing First programs between 2015 and 2019.

However, the report does not provide evidence that Housing First directly caused that increase.

Gretna police initially reported that five people had been detained, but ICE later clarified the number was four. According to ICE, one of the individuals was convicted for assault and another had a fraud charge.

The detentions occurred at the Home Depot at 62 Westbank Expressway. Cell phone footage shared on social media appears to show ICE agents running through the store in pursuit of a person. One video, posted by the Facebook page Impacto Informativo, shows agents moving quickly through what the page says is the interior of the store. Another clip, posted by the immigrant rights group Unión Migrante, shows agents attempting to restrain an individual outside.

In one video, officers can be heard yelling at a man recording them on his phone, telling him to move back 25 feet. But there is no 25-foot rule. State lawmakers passed a 25-foot buffer law in 2024, but a federal judge struck it down earlier this year, so it never went into effect.

“The law was written in such a way that… the average person couldn’t figure out what was illegal and what was legal,"" attorney Scott Sternberg told WWL's David Hammer. "" And 25 feet from an officer could be a balcony on Bourbon Street, or someone interfering with an arrest. It could be things we want to stop and also things that are not illegal.”

RELATED: Officers demand 25-foot buffer during ICE arrests. But that's not the law.

Gretna police told WWL they’ve already reminded their officers that no such law exists. Deputy Chief Jason DiMarco said the officer in the video insisted he wasn’t trying to enforce a 25-foot rule — he just thought the man recording was “trying to stir things up.”

“If you’re not doing anything wrong, you don’t have anything to worry about… We’re all around the area — the Gretna Police Department,"" DiMarco said. ""If you’re not doing anything wrong, you don’t have anything to worry about.”

Authorities stressed that the operation was not related to the “Swamp Sweep” enforcement action scheduled to begin on Dec. 1, which will involve Border Patrol agents. Wednesday’s operation involved only ICE personnel.

Home Depot said it had no prior knowledge of the enforcement activity. In a statement to WWL Louisiana, the company said: “We aren’t notified that immigration enforcement activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations. We aren't coordinating with ICE or Border Patrol. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

Unión Migrante, which has been documenting immigration enforcement actions in the region, held a small press conference outside the store later in the afternoon. Volunteer Sebastián Piraban said the group was preparing for heightened enforcement expected in December.

“I know what’s coming — this storm on December first — it’s gonna be bad,” he said. “But we have to get ready, we have to do everything legally possible to help the vulnerable people of this community.”

Witnesses told local station WWL that they saw a person running beneath the Westbank Expressway before being taken into custody nearby. Gretna police said no criminal charges were filed in connection with the incident.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Wednesday that Kempsville High School assistant principal John Wilson Bennett and his older brother Mark Booth Bennett were overheard at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach allegedly conspiring to go to Nevada and plan attacks on ICE agents in retribution for what they claimed to be “kidnapping[s]” of civilians during recent immigration enforcement operations.

“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers—offering such specifics as to getting a high-caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” McLaughlin said, after Fox News Digital originally reported on the adult brothers’ arrest days ago.

“Thanks to Homeland Security Investigations and our partners, these men are behind bars.”

John Bennett has been faculty at the school, located in the inland part of Virginia Beach, since 2009. The school told local press that he is currently on leave.

McLaughlin said DHS worked with law enforcement at all levels after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach on Nov. 17 discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents,” with Mark Bennett allegedly saying he was planning to meet like-minded people in Las Vegas, where he would also purchase firearms with explosive rounds.

Two days later, Mark Bennett was arrested at Norfolk International Airport en route to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, to connect to Las Vegas. John Bennett was also arrested that day.

McLaughlin said the case is indicative of the more-than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE agents and 8,000-fold spike in death threats as they go about their daily work defending the homeland.

“They risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, terrorists, and gang members. From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families,” McLaughlin said.

Happy O’Brien, Mark Bennett’s attorney, disputed the recounting of events, reportedly saying his client was instead flying to Nevada for a F1 (Formula One) motorsports event with his child, according to the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot.

O’Brien reportedly compared the restaurant conversation to something out of the NBC sitcom “Seinfeld” – where Jerry Seinfeld’s and Jason Alexander’s characters would often have varying degrees of existential conversations while having coffee at “Monk’s.”

“No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” he said.

Trump’s remarks, released in a video on social media, underscores his intention to reshape the country’s immigration system and increase scrutiny of migrants who are already here. With aggressive deportation efforts already underway, his response to the shooting showed that his focus will not waver.

The suspect in the shooting is believed to be an Afghan national, according to Trump and two law enforcement officials. He entered the United States in September 2021, after the chaotic collapse of the government in Kabul, when Americans were frantically evacuating people as the Taliban took control.

The 29-year-old suspect was part of Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era program that resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. The initiative brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators.

It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

Trump described Afghanistan as “a hellhole on earth,” and he said his administration would review everyone who entered from the country under President Joe Biden — a measure his administration had already been planning before the incident.

During his remarks, Trump also swung his focus to Minnesota, where he complained about “hundreds of thousands of Somalians"" who are ""ripping apart that once-great state.”

Minnesota has the country’s largest Somali community, roughly 87,000 people. Many came as refugees over the years.

The reference to immigrants with no connection to Wednesday's developments was a reminder of the scope of Trump's ambitions to rein in migration.

Administration officials have been ramping up deportations of people in the country illegally, as well as clamping down on refugee admissions. The focus has involved the realignment of resources at federal agencies, stirring concern about potentially undermining other law enforcement priorities.

However, Trump’s remarks were a signal that scrutiny of migrants and the nation's borders will only increase. He said he wants to remove anyone “who does not belong here or does not add benefit to our country.""

“If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them,"" Trump added.

Afterward, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would indefinitely stop processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals pending a review of security and vetting protocols.

Supporters of Afghan evacuees said they feared that people who escaped danger from the Taliban would now face renewed suspicion and scrutiny.

“I don’t want people to leverage this tragedy into a political ploy,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac.

He said Wednesday's shooting should not shed a negative light on the tens of thousands of Afghan nationals who have gone through the various legal pathways to resettling in the U.S. and those who await in the pipeline.

Under Operation Allies Welcome, tens of thousands of Afghans were first brought to U.S. military bases around the country, where they completed immigration processing and medical evaluations before settling into the country. Four years later, there are still scores of Afghans who were evacuated at transit points in the Middle East and Europe as part of the program.

Those in countries like Qatar and Albania, who have undergone the rigorous process, have been left in limbo since Trump entered his second term and paused the program as part of his series of executive actions cracking down on immigration.

Vice President JD Vance, writing on social media, criticized Biden for “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees,"" adding that “they shouldn't have been in our country.”

“Already some voices in corporate media chirp that our immigration policies are too harsh,” he said. “Tonight is a reminder of why they’re wrong.”

The White House press secretary’s brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11.
Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver’s license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card.
Neither the record of Ferreira’s arrest record or how any charges were resolved were immediately available.
At the time, the newspaper said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was eight months old.","Karoline Leavitt’s nephew’s mother has been detained by US immigration agents in Revere, Massachusetts, as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the US from Brazil as a child, is now in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Louisiana, according to the Boston radio station WBUR, which first reported the arrest.

The White House press secretary’s brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11.

Ferreira was leaving her home to pick up her son from school in New Hampshire when her car was “suddenly swarmed” by ICE agents, according to the Boston Globe. Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver’s license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card.

“They were not the most gentle with her,” she told the Globe.

“I’m sure my sister was terrified, frantic. She’s been here since she was six years old. She’s more American than she is anything else. I’m sure she tried to just use whatever she could come up with in the moment. However, it didn’t really help very much.”

A White House source familiar with the situation said: “This individual is the mother of Karoline’s nephew and they have not spoken in many years. The child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born. He has never resided with his mother.”

Separately, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that “ICE arrested Bruna Caroline Ferreria [sic], a criminal illegal alien from Brazil. She has a previous arrest for battery. She entered the US on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the US by 6 June 1999. She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings.”

They added: “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement to WBUR that Ferreira had a “previous arrest for battery”.

Neither the record of Ferreira’s arrest record or how any charges were resolved were immediately available.

At a minimum, Ferreira’s detention and likely deportation has brought home the close or casual connections many Americans have to the administration’s immigration crackdown.

Leavitt, the 28-year-old New Hampshire native, is best known for her high-ranking role as Trump’s spokesperson. Leavitt began her career interning at Fox News in 2016 before serving in the communications office during Trump’s first term.

When Trump entered office for a second time in January, Leavitt made history by becoming the youngest-ever White House press secretary.

Less is known about her brother except that he won $1m in a DraftKings fantasy sports contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. At the time, the newspaper said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was eight months old.

In a statement to WBUR, Leavitt said: “My only concern has always been the safety, wellbeing, and privacy of my son.”

Ferreira’s attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN that his client had been arrested on 12 November and was currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship.

Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, has now started a GoFundMe page to help with legal costs to fight the ICE charges and permit her sister to stay in the US.

Ferreira has maintained her legal status through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program which grants temporary protection from deportation for those who entered the country as children, according to the post.

Ferreira has “followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing”, according to her sister’s GoFundMe page. As of Wednesday morning, more than $16,000 has been raised.

“She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,” Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote. “Whether it’s supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.”

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Daca recipients have been among those detained in immigration sweeps, although steps taken by Trump to end Daca during his first term were blocked by the supreme court.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e782ff34940ae6bcbae835c42f3ea2ff988eb1a3/407_0_4081_3264/master/4081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84f82b8b21eba0ed1012c8740024b1af",N,,2025-11-27 01:56:18.020610

After Shooting - The New York Times,"Shawn McCreesh, www.nytimes.com, shawn-mccreesh",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/us/politics/trump-national-guard-dc-shooting.html,"President Trump on Wednesday called for a crackdown on immigration and ordered 500 more troops to Washington after the shooting of two National Guard members patrolling the capital and the identification of an Afghan national as the suspect.
Their deployment would be the latest development in a monthslong debate about the role of the National Guard in American cities to tackle crime.
The Supreme Court is considering whether the president can deploy hundreds of National Guard troops in the Chicago area over the objections of state and local leaders.
Last week, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the president’s National Guard deployment appeared to violate the law.
The shooting on Wednesday was sure to inflame the debate about how Mr. Trump has used the National Guard as part of his crackdown on crime.","President Trump on Wednesday called for a crackdown on immigration and ordered 500 more troops to Washington after the shooting of two National Guard members patrolling the capital and the identification of an Afghan national as the suspect.

Mr. Trump posted a video shortly after 9 p.m. from Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending Thanksgiving, describing the shooting as an “act of terror” and “a crime against humanity.” He called the suspect, whom people familiar with the investigation identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an “animal” who shot the guard members “at point-blank range in a monstrous, ambush-style attack just steps away from the White House.”

Although many details about the shooting were still unknown by nightfall on Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not hold back. He used the attack to launch a broadside against immigration, saying the shooting “underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation” and vowing to redouble his mass deportation efforts.

He said the suspect had entered the country in 2021 as part of a program under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that provided entry to Afghan nationals fleeing the Taliban takeover of their country after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops.

“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country under Biden,” he said.

The president described what he saw as the stakes in nearly apocalyptic rhetoric. He called Afghanistan “a hellhole on earth” and warned about Somali refugees in what he called “the once great state” of Minnesota, renewing a push he made last week to strip protections from them. “No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” he said.

Still, it was not immediately clear exactly how he might change immigration policy as a result. Mr. Trump’s administration is already pursuing mass deportations and has taken steps to remove immigration protections for many Afghans.

More concrete was Mr. Trump’s request for hundreds more troops on the streets of the capital, in addition to the about 2,000 already there. Their deployment would be the latest development in a monthslong debate about the role of the National Guard in American cities to tackle crime. The Guard has traditionally been asked to provide humanitarian assistance when deployed domestically.

There is only one other city, Memphis, where troops are currently deployed; other cities are embroiled in court fights over whether troops can be deployed there. The Supreme Court is considering whether the president can deploy hundreds of National Guard troops in the Chicago area over the objections of state and local leaders.

Last week, a federal judge in Washington ruled that the president’s National Guard deployment appeared to violate the law. In particular, the decision found the combination of troops from a number of Republican states, assembled in Washington under central command, to be an unlawful use of the National Guard.

In her decision, Judge Jia M. Cobb blocked the deployment of the troops, who were scheduled to remain in the city until at least the end of February. But she stayed her own order, pausing it from taking effect until Dec. 11 in the interest of “orderly proceedings.” The Justice Department has appealed the ruling and sought emergency relief on Wednesday.

The shooting on Wednesday was sure to inflame the debate about how Mr. Trump has used the National Guard as part of his crackdown on crime.

Maj. Gen. William Enyart, a former adjutant general of Illinois — the Guard’s top officer in the state — said he was shocked that two Guard members had been shot near the White House.

“It is probably one of the safest places on this planet to be, so for two guardsmen to be murdered there — or shot and desperately wounded — in that location is really astounding,” said Mr. Enyart, who is a former Democratic congressman.

“I don’t want to see this turned into a political football,” he added, “which I’m afraid will happen.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/26dc-trump-guard/26dc-trump-guard-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 00:56:41.164708

“No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival,” he said.

Trump’s remarks, released in a video on social media, underscores his intention to reshape the country’s immigration system and increase scrutiny of migrants who are already here. With aggressive deportation efforts already underway, his response to the shooting showed that his focus will not waver.

The suspect in the shooting is believed to be an Afghan national, according to Trump and two law enforcement officials. He entered the United States in September 2021, after the chaotic collapse of the government in Kabul, when Americans were frantically evacuating people as the Taliban took control.

The 29-year-old suspect was part of Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era program that resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. The initiative brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators.

It has since faced intense scrutiny from Trump and his allies, congressional Republicans and some government watchdogs over gaps in the vetting process and the speed of admissions, even as advocates say it offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

Trump described Afghanistan as “a hellhole on earth,” and he said his administration would review everyone who entered from the country under President Joe Biden — a measure his administration had already been planning before the incident.

During his remarks, Trump also swung his focus to Minnesota, where he complained about “hundreds of thousands of Somalians"" who are ""ripping apart that once-great state.”

U.S. District Senior Judge R.

The lawsuit accuses immigration agents of indiscriminately arresting Latinos to meet the Trump administration's immigration enforcement goals without evaluating the requirements to legally detain them.

The judge said each of the plaintiffs had long-standing ties to their communities and no reasonable agent could have believed they were likely to flee before obtaining a warrant.

Under federal law, immigration agents must have probable cause to believe someone is in the country illegally and likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained, in order to arrest them without one, Jackson said.

Immigration agents are also required to document the reasons for arresting someone.

Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin called Jackson's decision an ""activist ruling"" and said the department follows the law.

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) abrupt decision to quit Congress could reshape the foreign policy debate among Capitol Hill Republicans as they grapple with the future — and the very meaning — of President Trump’s “America First” mantra.
“I ran for Congress in 2020 and have fought every single day believing that Make America Great Again meant America First,” she said in the statement announcing her resignation.
But Greene fired back, saying she was merely staying pure to the “America First” cause Trump had abandoned.
Other Republicans beyond Massie and Paul have downplayed the impact of Greene’s departure on the foreign policy debate — and made clear it is the president who does the most to drive the party’s direction.
“As far as foreign policy, the person I look to is the president and, of course, my longtime friend Marco Rubio,” Haridopolos added, referring to the secretary of State.","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) abrupt decision to quit Congress could reshape the foreign policy debate among Capitol Hill Republicans as they grapple with the future — and the very meaning — of President Trump’s “America First” mantra.

Greene, perhaps more than anyone else in the Capitol, has personified the isolationist wing of the MAGA movement that propelled Trump’s political rise, and hers along with it. Few lawmakers cheered louder when Trump cracked down on immigration, attacked NATO, bashed his predecessors for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of this year’s DOGE purge. She is a staunch critic of foreign aid, to include Ukraine and Israel, and has dubbed herself as “America Only.”

Those positions put Greene at odds with other Republicans who saw room in “America First” for “pragmatic” foreign interventions — not to mention the neocons of the old GOP order — but aligned her squarely with Trump’s pledge to shift U.S. policy away from foreign endeavors and focus instead on tackling domestic problems.

“I ran for Congress in 2020 and have fought every single day believing that Make America Great Again meant America First,” she said in the statement announcing her resignation.

In a stunning twist, however, it was tensions over foreign policy that caused the early cracks in the Trump-Greene alliance, as the Georgia firebrand spoke out loudly against the president’s decisions this year to strike Iran, bail out Argentina, send military aid to Ukraine, and continue to arm Israel even as the civilian casualties skyrocketed in Gaza. She was the only congressional Republican to dub Israel’s actions in Gaza a “genocide.”

Trump, in cutting ties with his onetime MAGA ally, called Greene a “raving lunatic” and a “traitor” for vocally criticizing his policies. But Greene fired back, saying she was merely staying pure to the “America First” cause Trump had abandoned. In Greene’s telling, she was simply pressing the president to make good on the commitments he’d made on the campaign trail — vows she said Trump had betrayed by continuing, and in some cases escalating, U.S. interventions overseas.

“My only goal and desire has ever been to hold the Republican Party accountable for the promises it makes to the American people and put America First,” she said in her resignation statement.

“If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can’t even relate to real Americans,” she added, “then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”

Her exit means Capitol Hill will have one fewer Republican holding Trump’s feet to the fire when it comes to foreign policy endeavors — a role that will be left largely to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), two isolationists who have also jousted frequently with the president over U.S. ventures abroad.

“This is not great news for our country,” Massie said of Greene’s decision to leave Congress.

With her resignation, Greene joins a long list of conservatives who sparred with Trump only to be pushed out of power — a demonstration that the president’s sway over the Republican Party remains enormous despite his diminishing approval ratings. But Paul warned this week that Trump is treading on thin ice as he eyes an aggressive foreign policy — moves that risk alienating his MAGA loyalists.

“If he invades Venezuela or if he approves significant arms sales [to Ukraine], … the rift with Marjorie Greene will pale in comparison to what happens to his movement,” Paul said in an interview with Reason Magazine. “If he invades Venezuela or gives more money to Ukraine, his movement will dissolve.”

Greene had repeatedly led amendments to cut foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine, helping to put her fellow Republicans on the record on the issue and sometimes getting dozens of House Republicans to vote along with her, such as on a July amendment to a Pentagon funding bill that would prevent funds from being used to aid Ukraine. On that amendment, 76 Republicans voted in favor.

But the amendment votes were often a futile effort, frequently failing — sometimes overwhelmingly — on the House floor. In July, a Greene amendment to cut funding to the Israel Cooperative Program that funds missile defense for Israel ended in a 6-422 vote, with Massie being the only Republican who voted with her.

That frustrated Greene, who lashed out at her GOP colleagues: “Both Republicans and Democrats refuse to stop sending your hard earned tax dollars to foreign countries,” she posted on X.

Other Republicans beyond Massie and Paul have downplayed the impact of Greene’s departure on the foreign policy debate — and made clear it is the president who does the most to drive the party’s direction.

“I never saw her as a big force in anything, whether it be domestic or foreign policy,” Rep. Mike Haridopolos (R-Fla.) said of Greene on Tuesday.

“As far as foreign policy, the person I look to is the president and, of course, my longtime friend Marco Rubio,” Haridopolos added, referring to the secretary of State.

And there is plenty of Republican support in Congress for taking a stronger, more active stance in foreign affairs — particularly on legislation imposing sanctions on countries helping enable Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) last week pledged to submit a discharge petition to force a vote on such legislation, following the Trump administration’s reported 28-point peace plan that was widely panned among some Republicans as a pro-Moscow proposal. U.S. officials have said the document is not the final offer and that it would likely change. Ukraine agreed to the core elements of the peace plan, a U.S. official confirmed Tuesday to NewsNation.

“A lot of us believe in Ronald Reagan, you know, peace and strength and standing up to a dictator that’s invading an innocent country. I mean, I have such moral clarity on this,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who is leading that effort with Fitzpatrick, told The Hill on Monday. “Not standing up to Russia is a terrible strategic mistake. I want our conference and Republicans to stand up and be clear about it.”

Greene’s resistance to foreign assistance and intervention as she’s gotten on the bad side of Trump has made her some strange bedfellows on the left, some of whom have expressed their appreciation for Greene in light of her resignation announcement.

Media Benjamin, the founder of left-wing peace activist group Code Pink, posted a video on X outside Greene’s office on Monday expressing appreciation for both the Georgian’s stances and a sign posted on her office door warning against foreign lobbying.

“While we can disagree with the congresswoman on all kinds of things, let’s remember, there are very, very few Republican officials who have stood up to the Israel lobby and have called out Israel for its genocide. And for that, we are grateful,” Benjamin said in the video.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GreeneForeignPolicy_HouseTeam_Getty-Bloomberg_GraemeSloan.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-27 00:56:55.614569

The Department of Homeland Security said Ferreira overstayed a tourist visa and has a prior battery arrest — allegations Pomerleau disputes.
""Age of 6, and they're calling her a criminal illegal alien.""
By then, she already had DACA, which you can't get if you're a criminal illegal alien, cause [of] its disqualifying factors for people who have crimes.""
The White House press secretary has not publicly commented on the case.","A Brazilian woman who had been living in the United States for most of her life is being held in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana as she fights deportation.

The woman, identified as 33-year-old Bruna Ferreira of Revere, Massachusetts, is the mother of the nephew of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, according to official sources familiar with the case.

Ferreira's lawyer Todd Pomerleau said she was detained on Nov. 12 after leaving her home in Revere to pick up her 11-year-old son in New Hampshire. Pomerleau said ICE agents stopped her and detained her. She then was taken to Vermont before being moved to Louisiana.

The Department of Homeland Security said Ferreira overstayed a tourist visa and has a prior battery arrest — allegations Pomerleau disputes. He argues that Ferreira arrived in the U.S. as a child and later qualified for DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

""She came here at 6 years old,"" said Pomerleau. ""Age of 6, and they're calling her a criminal illegal alien.""

He insists the government's claims about a visa violation are not correct.

""They're saying she violated a visa,"" he said. ""You can't violate a visa under the immigration laws until six months after your 18th birthday. By then, she already had DACA, which you can't get if you're a criminal illegal alien, cause [of] its disqualifying factors for people who have crimes.""

Ferreira shares custody of her son with Michael Leavitt, brother to Karoline Leavitt. A source confirmed the family connection, but said the two women have not spoken in years. The White House press secretary has not publicly commented on the case.

Pomerleau described the past relationship between Ferreira and Michael Leavitt as typical of many young couples.

""Like a modern family,"" he said. ""They're two people that were young and in love at one point. They were engaged to be married, and it didn't work out, like countless others.""

In a statement, DHS described Ferreira as ""a criminal illegal alien from Brazil"" and said she entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa requiring her departure by June 6, 1999.

Her attorney disputes the agency's claims and said he has seen no evidence she ever committed a crime.

""Under the immigration laws, she's following the only processes that she has available to her, and I've seen no proof whatsoever that she has ever committed a crime,"" Pomerleau said.

Pedro Latorre, a church deacon who lives across from Ferreira's home, said the situation has been painful for many Hispanic families in the area.

""It's very painful for the family,"" he said, adding that fear has been widespread. ""I'm concerned because we know each other, and the problem is that ... people are afraid about this.""

Ferreira remains in custody as her attorney seeks bond. A judge could decide on her release by Thanksgiving.",https://media.nbcboston.com/2025/11/Karoline-Leavitt-Bruna-Ferreira.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-27 11:58:55.254522

DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they’ve committed a crime,” she said.
This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas.
Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients’ access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
Detained DACA recipients question their arrests Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, Texas, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.","Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. Federal agents jumped out, one pointed a weapon at him, and they took him into custody.

Vijandre is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people from deportation since 2012 if they were brought to the United States as children and generally stayed out of trouble. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters.

His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump’s administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism.

DACA was created to shield recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” from immigration arrests and deportation. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Recipients reapply every two years. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them.

In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people “who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they’ve committed a crime,” she said.

McLaughlin also claimed in a statement that Vijandre made social media posts “glorifying terrorism,” including one she said celebrated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida’s leader in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006.

An attorney for Vijandre, Chris Godshall-Bennett, said Vijandre’s social media activity is “clearly” protected speech. He also said the government has not provided details about the specific posts in court documents.

Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14.

DACA has faced legal challenges

DACA survived the first Trump administration’s attempt to rescind the program when the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the administration did not take the proper steps to end it.

There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients.

This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work.

The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients’ access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year.

“This administration might not be trying to end DACA altogether the way that they did the first time around, but they are chipping away at it,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, spokesperson for United We Dream, which is part of Home is Here, the coalition keeping track of public cases of DACA recipients who have been detained.

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests

Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, Texas, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.

Days later, federal officers arrested Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira as the 28-year-old father was arriving at his El Paso home with his children following a doctor’s appointment. Agents dislocated his shoulder, according to his attorneys.

Both Santiago and Gamez Lira were held for over a month while their attorneys petitioned for their release.

Marisa Ong, an attorney for Santiago and Gamez Lira, said the government failed to notify either of her clients of any intention to terminate their DACA status.

“DACA recipients have a constitutionally protected interest in their continued liberty,” Ong said, adding that “the government cannot take away that liberty without providing some valid reason.”

DACA recipients can lose their status if they are convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanors like those involving harming others, driving under the influence or drug distribution, or three or more misdemeanors. They can also lose their status if they pose a threat to national security or public safety.

DHS claimed in a statement that Santiago was previously charged with trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia and that Gamez Lira was previously arrested for marijuana possession.

Ong said that when attorneys sought their release “the government presented no evidence of any past misconduct by either individual.”

Vijandre, the Dallas-area man who was arrested in October, remains in a Georgia detention facility. His attorneys say he received notice two weeks before his arrest that the government planned to terminate his DACA status but that he wasn’t given a chance to fight it.

“I think that the administration has drawn a very clear line and at least for right now, between citizen and noncitizens, and their goal is to remove as many noncitizens from the country as possible and to make it as difficult as possible for noncitizens to enter the country,” Godshall-Bennett, Vijandre’s attorney, said.",https://kfoxtv.com/resources/media/fbda0991-08d2-4a24-9e70-1cd2ca9a1e49-jumbo16x9_dacadreamerprotestjpg8395745ver10.jpg?1513864866033,N,,2025-11-26 21:57:41.775612

The federal government funds the program monthly, while states administer SNAP benefits.
Lawful permanent residents are only eligible for SNAP benefits after a five-year waiting period, given they meet other requirements.
Meanwhile, the lawsuit claims that the Oct. 31 guidance from USDA should have marked the start of the 120-day period.
Starting in 2028, states must fund a portion of SNAP benefits if its payment error rate is equal to or greater than 6 percent this year or next.","Democratic officials in 21 states and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Wednesday, alleging that it is “arbitrarily” excluding many lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Ore., says the USDA is unlawfully implementing guidance for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act.

The sweeping budget legislation, signed into law by President Trump in July, enacted significant changes to SNAP. It expanded work requirements to groups previously exempt from them, changed eligibility for noncitizens and enacted penalties for noncompliance by states.

The federal government funds the program monthly, while states administer SNAP benefits. The USDA issued new guidance in accordance with the OBBB on Oct. 31, one day before the end of the 120-day exclusionary period for states to adhere to the changes.

The changes to the program restricted SNAP eligibility to three groups of noncitizens: lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants and those lawfully residing in the U.S. from Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau.

Lawful permanent residents are only eligible for SNAP benefits after a five-year waiting period, given they meet other requirements.

However, the lawsuit filed on Wednesday alleges the USDA is misinterpreting the new eligibility provisions of the law, which did not bar “individuals who once held the status of refugees, individuals granted asylum, or parolees from gaining eligibility for SNAP” if and when they become lawful permanent residents.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit claims that the Oct. 31 guidance from USDA should have marked the start of the 120-day period. Instead, USDA is arguing that July 4, when Trump signed the OBBB, is when that time frame began.

Starting in 2028, states must fund a portion of SNAP benefits if its payment error rate is equal to or greater than 6 percent this year or next.

In sum, the changes to SNAP eligibility and the rollout of guidance “has caused significant confusion” for states, which “have been asked to implement new substantive, erroneous limitations on SNAP eligibility, many of which could not have been anticipated as they diverge from the text of the OBBB, in 24 hours.”

The plaintiff states have asked the court to stay and vacate the guidance from USDA.

A spokesperson for the USDA said Wednesday that it “does not comment on pending litigation,” but directed The Hill to the Justice Department.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP25300778196167-e1761934676866.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-26 23:56:43.667724

Records previously obtained by KATU show Team Housing Solutions, a Texas based federal contractor had, on Nov. 4, asked the city about leasing space at the Newport airport.
""We are unanimously opposed to an ICE facility in Newport, and we need our Coast Guard helicopter back permanently,"" he says in the video.","Evidence that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is eyeing Newport for an immigration detention facility continues to mount.

The latest updates include inquiries from federal contractors, including one made on behalf of ICE.

As first reported by the Capitol Chronicle, Solv LLC, an environmental consulting firm based in Virginia, emailed the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development asking procedural questions about an environmental assessment required by both state and federal law for major coastline projects.

The email inquiry, obtained by KATU through a records request, notes in the signature that it is being made on behalf of ICE. The inquiry does not specify what type of project the assessment is for.

In a video post on social media made Tuesday, Newport Mayor Jan Kaplan also announced more federal inquiries.

""We confirm today that Team Housing Solutions has called multiple hotels up and down the coast, as recently as this morning, looking for as many as 200 hotel rooms for a year,"" he said in the video.

Records previously obtained by KATU show Team Housing Solutions, a Texas based federal contractor had, on Nov. 4, asked the city about leasing space at the Newport airport.

The Department of Homeland Security, which houses both U.S. Coast Guard and ICE as federal agencies, owns a landing pad at the airport that it has used for the USCG rescue helicopter.

On Nov. 10, when Kaplan first went public with concerns about the potential for a detention facility, he pointed out that the relocation of the rescue helicopter to North Bend had been clue number one.

In 2014, when the USCG had intended to remove the helicopter, it had notified the community well in advance. This time leaders and advocates for commercial anglers say there was no notification about the relocation.

Newport nonprofit Fishermen's Wives and Lincoln County sued to have the helicopter brought back in 2014. Members of the state's congressional delegation ultimately succeeded in passing legislation to keep the helicopter there temporarily. The same parties filed a similar lawsuit, first reported by KATU, on Nov. 21.

PAST COVERAGE: Tears, frustration & fear from 800+ attending Newport meeting on potential ICE facility

In a win for the Newport nonprofit and Lincoln County, a federal judge on Monday granted a temporary restraining order telling USCG to bring the helicopter back. The order lasts two weeks.

""We were excited about (the ruling). Happy. It's a good start. We have a really long fight in front of us and we realize that it's, especially for our small group, we're just nine strong as far as the women on our board,"" said Taunette Dixon, a board member and spokesperson for the nonprofit, during an interview with KATU on Tuesday.

Kaplan said Tuesday the helicopter had been spotted back in the community, though it was unclear whether it was refueling or there as a result of the judge's order.

Kaplan also said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter landed in Newport to refuel and seemed to insinuate in his social media video post that there may have been ulterior motives for the stop.

""It's important to note that since our airport has fuel, the FAA requires us to provide fuel to any aircraft that lands at our airport. The pilot of the helicopter told our staff that they tried to refuel in Tillamook, but there was no one at the airport, so they flew here for fuel,"" Kaplan can be heard saying in the video. ""It's also important to note that there are seven airports in Oregon with fuel options that would have been closer than Newport.""

Kaplan goes on to list recent job postings for immigration detention officers in the area, the most recent of which he says was made on Nov 19.

Since Time Magazine launched the TIME100 Next list six years ago, an extension of its annual 100 Most Influential People list, it has served as a pedestal for individuals who are on the come-up in their respective fields.

“While we’ve made it our mission to cover people who have reached the pinnacle of their fields, the TIME100 Next is an opportunity to recognize those still on the rise,” Time Editor in Chief Sam Jacobs wrote in an editorial accompanying this year’s list.

Published on Sept. 30, the 2025 iteration of the TIME100 Next list features short pieces about each member of this year’s class.

The list, which Time magazine described as “The World’s Most Influential Rising Stars,” is divided into sections including “Innovators,” “Phenoms,” “Artists,” “Leaders,” and “Advocates.” It includes actors, authors, musicians, business owners, athletes, CEOs and philanthropists from around the world who the magazine deems worthy of recognition.

Included among those influential individuals on the list is a Valley attorney who has devoted his career to immigrant and human rights.

Efrén Olivares, who practices law in McAllen, made the 2025 TIME100 Next list — a recognition that he said came as a surprise.

“I didn’t apply,” he said. “It’s not something that one applies to. They just select people.”

He said that he first became aware that he was being considered when representatives from the magazine reached out to his colleagues at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization where he currently serves as vice president of Litigation and Legal Strategy.

It was in September that the magazine contacted his colleagues to inform them that he had been selected.

“I thought just being considered for it was already itself an honor, but when once I found out that I had gotten it, I was just very excited, both for myself and also for the issues that I work on,” Olivares said. “It’s a recognition that the work for immigrants rights and defending the rights of immigrants, especially in this moment, was being looked at and recognized by the magazine. I was very excited about that.”

Olivares was recognized in the “Advocates” section with a brief essay written by Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and president of the RFK Human Rights nonprofit advocacy organization.

“For years, Efrén has championed human dignity. He’s defended families cruelly separated at the U.S.-Mexico border,” Kennedy wrote. “Through his work at the National Immigration Law Center, he’s stopped the midnight deportation of unaccompanied children denied fair court hearings. And as our co-counsel, he’s battling a federal plan to force immigrants to report for registration as a prelude to detention and deportation.

“He isn’t just a brilliant lawyer. He’s an example of the principles we’re fighting to protect.”

Olivares was born in Allende, a town located about three hours southwest from the Rio Grande Valley in the Mexican state of Nuevo León. He said that he’d spent most of his childhood in Allende with the rest of his family.

It wasn’t until he was about 9 years old that circumstances led to his family having to seek opportunities elsewhere.

“I was living in Mexico, and most of my family was in Mexico, and I was planning to live my life in Mexico,” he recalled. “When I was nine, my dad just ran out of work. He couldn’t find work anymore. Like so many adults in Mexico in the 90s, after NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) was enacted, he ran out of work. He had been a truck driver for most of his life, so he came to the U.S. looking for work, and he found a job as a school bus driver at Valley View in Pharr.”

Olivares said that his father had a visa allowing him to move to the country because his grandfather had been born in the United States. While his father lived and worked in the U.S., eventually earning his citizenship, Olivares had to stay behind in Mexico with his mother and his siblings.

It would be four years before they too were able to join his father and move to the United States.

“I came in when I was 13,” he recalled. “I was supposed to go into eighth grade, but I didn’t speak English, so they kept me down a year. I went into seventh grade at Valley View. That’s where I graduated from high school.”

After graduating from Valley View High School in 2001, Olivares became the first member of his family to attend college.

He attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, an experience that he described as a culture shock.

“When I moved to the Valley, most people spoke Spanish. The food was not that different. The music was not that different,” Olivares said. “Then I got to Philly, and I was like, ‘Whoa, this is the rest of the U.S.’”

Olivares graduated in 2005 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics. He then attended Yale Law School, where he graduated in 2008.

“When I went to law school, I wanted to be involved in human rights work,” Olivares said. “I thought I wanted to specialize in Indigenous people’s rights. And in fact, the first human rights job that I got was exactly about that. It involved the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, in Guatemala and Peru, Colombia, Brazil. That was the work that I was doing.”

After a few years, Olivares returned to the Valley where he began working with the Texas Civil Rights Project in December 2013.

A few months after returning to his home in South Texas, Olivares found himself at the center of a human rights crisis as the first influx of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador began arriving in the Rio Grande Valley.

Many local entities scrambled to provide support for the large volume of children arriving in the area by providing food and shelter. It was then that Olivares decided to offer his services as well by focusing his attention on immigration and border-related issues.

“I went to law school driven by this conviction to provide the best possible legal representation to those who can least afford it,” Olivares said. “I am a firm believer that the outcome of a case or an issue should not depend on how much you are able to pay your lawyer. It should depend on the merits of the issue and the injustice that has been perpetrated. That’s what I’ve been trying to do my entire career — be the best possible lawyer I can be for folks who cannot afford to pay anything.”

As the issues surrounding the border evolved over time, so has Olivares’s career. Through his law practice, he has found himself navigating the constantly evolving border issues, from border wall issues to family separation issues.

Many of his experiences were captured in his 2022 book, “My Boy Will Die of Sorrow: A Memoir of Immigration From the Front Lines.”

His book details Olivares’s first-hand accounts representing hundreds of immigrant families, parents who were separated from their children as a result of zero tolerance during the summer of 2018. Those stories are told alongside his own experience of being separated from his father while he worked in the United States.

The 302 page memoir earned Olivares the 2023 International Latino Book Award in the Raul Yzaguirre Best Political/Current Affairs Book category.

Despite the eye-opening accounts captured in Olivares’s book, it is only one chapter in a book that is constantly being rewritten as immigration and border-related issues continue to evolve. And through it all, Olivares remains in the eye of the storm.

When asked why those issues continue to be at the forefront of many political agendas, his answer was simple, “bigotry.”

“Politicians look for a scapegoat. They look for somebody to blame in the face of problems; the economy is not doing well, or you’ve got COVID, or rising prices, lack of jobs, any issues that all countries face for different reasons,” Olivares said. “They just point the finger, and they happen to point the finger at the most vulnerable people in our communities who happen to be, by and large, Black or brown. I think that is what’s driving this sentiment.”

With the work never ceasing, Olivares was still able to take a moment to reflect on his recognition in the magazine — an accolade that he described as surreal.

“It’s honestly hard to believe that,” he said. “Here I am, this kid from Allende who went to public school in Mexico, and just kind of had to migrate to another country. I’m just doing my work and trying my best at it.”",https://myrgv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112625.EFREN_OLIVARES.jm_.001.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 19:56:54.318938

In a statement, the Homeland Security Department announced the Haitian TPS cancellation — which is a tacit assertion on the Trump administration's part that conditions inside Haiti have improved sufficiently for Haitians to return there.

""After consulting with interagency partners, Secretary (Kristi) Noem concluded that Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.

""This decision was based on a review conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, input from relevant U.S. government agencies, and an analysis indicating that allowing Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is inconsistent with U.S. national interests.”

The Haitian TPS termination takes effect on Feb. 3, 2026.

But the move — which affects about 500,000 Haitians in the U.S. — contradicts numerous assessments about gang control and violence in Haiti.

That plague — which last year resulted in more than 5,600 people murdered and has turned more than 1 million Haitians into homeless refugees in this decade — has not improved but has in fact worsened, they say.

A big fear is that Haitians who lose TPS and are deported back to Haiti will only end up adding to those throngs of displaced people in the country.

Haiti's gangs, including the large confederation known as Viv Ansanm, already control 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince amid the country's government vacuum.

(A nine-member Temporary Presidential Council is currently trying, with little success, to arrange desperately needed new elections there.)

This month the U.N. issued a new report that warns how the gang takeovers and terror are now expanding beyond Port-au-Prince throughout the country's interior. Gang killings are track to exceed 6,000 this year.

TPS, which was created by Congress and is renewable every 18 months, allows migrants from countries torn by disasters or political violence to remain in the U.S. until it is deemed OK for them to go back.

TPS for Haitians was created in the wake of Haiti's catastrophic 2010 earthquake, which killed at least 200,000 people.

READ MORE: Port-au-Prince is about to fall to gangs. So is it 'crazy' to send Haitians back to Haiti?

Since President Trump took office again last January, he has pushed a campaign to cancel TPS renewal, not only for Haitians but Venezuelans and several other migrant nationalities, as part of his anti-immigration America First agenda.

Federal judges this year have blocked the administration from revoking Haitians' TPS before it was legally scheduled to end. But it's uncertain if the courts can stop its cancellation when the February renewal expires.

As a result, say Haitian-American immigration attorneys like Frandley Julien of North Miami, the Haitian community here had been bracing for Wednesday's decision.

""They know exactly what's happening here,"" Julien told WLRN.

""They just have to separate the administration's lie [about conditions in Haiti] from the reality that they know too well — how bad it is back home.

""Even so, this news of the TPS termination is devastating for them — especially since, true to form, the administration announced it on the eve Thanksgiving, as if to inflict as much emotional damage as possible to the community.""

Trump was also accused of anti-Haitian racism during last year's presidential campaign, when he publicly pushed the lie that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating residents' pets.

Either way, the DHS announcement warned that if ""you are an alien who is currently a beneficiary of TPS for Haiti, you should prepare to depart if you have no other lawful basis for remaining in the United States.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the coalition of other Democratic attorneys general, said in a statement Wednesday that the Trump administration is illegally cutting off benefits for tens of thousands of lawful permanent residents.

The USDA provided the new guidance to states narrowing SNAP eligibility last month, aligning with rollbacks of the program outlined in President Donald Trump’s domestic policy law that passed earlier this year.

The attorneys general argue in the lawsuit that the memo goes beyond what the law prescribes since it would make anyone who entered the country through humanitarian protection programs permanently ineligible for SNAP benefits — also known as food stamps — even if they become legal residents.

The group of attorneys general warn that the USDA’s guidance, which prompts a swift overhaul of eligibility systems, “threatens to destabilize SNAP nationwide,” and could put significant financial strain on states that would have to shoulder the cost of fines.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge in Oregon to vacate and block the implementation of the USDA’s guidance.

The filing comes just days after a federal judge in Virginia dismissed an indictment against James, whom President Donald Trump has viewed as a political opponent.

Well-known tech companies like Axon have begun offering AI components with their body cameras to assist in writing incident reports.","Tucked in a two-sentence footnote in a voluminous court opinion, a federal judge recently called out immigration agents using artificial intelligence to write use-of-force reports, raising concerns that it could lead to inaccuracies and further erode public confidence in how police have handled the immigration crackdown in the Chicago area and ensuing protests.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis wrote the footnote in a 223-page opinion issued last week, noting that the practice of using ChatGPT to write use-of-force reports undermines agents’ credibility and “may explain the inaccuracy of these reports.” She described what she saw in at least one body camera video, writing that an agent asks ChatGPT to compile a narrative for a report after giving the program a brief description and several images.

The judge noted factual discrepancies between the official narrative about those law enforcement responses and what body camera footage showed. But experts say the use of AI to write a report that depends on an officer’s specific perspective without using an officer’s actual experience is the worst possible use of the technology and raises serious concerns about accuracy and privacy.

An officer’s needed perspective

Law enforcement agencies across the country have been grappling with how to create guardrails that allow officers to use the increasingly available AI technology while maintaining accuracy, privacy and professionalism. Experts said the example recounted in the opinion didn’t meet that challenge.

“What this guy did is the worst of all worlds. Giving it a single sentence and a few pictures — if that’s true, if that’s what happened here — that goes against every bit of advice we have out there. It’s a nightmare scenario,” said Ian Adams, assistant criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who serves on a task force on artificial intelligence at the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear if the agency had guidelines or policies on the use of AI by agents. The body camera footage cited in the order has not yet been released.

Adams said few departments have put policies in place, but those that have often prohibit the use of predictive AI when writing reports justifying law enforcement decisions, especially use-of-force reports. Courts have established a standard referred to as objective reasonableness when considering whether a use of force was justified, relying heavily on the perspective of the officer.

“We need the specific articulated events of that event and the specific thoughts of that specific officer to let us know if this was a justified use of force,” Adams said. “That is the worst case scenario, other than explicitly telling it to make up facts, because you’re begging it to make up facts in this high-stakes situation.”

Private information and evidence

Besides raising concerns about an AI-generated report inaccurately characterizing what happened, the use of AI also raises potential privacy issues.

Katie Kinsey, chief of staff and tech policy counsel at the Policing Project at NYU School of Law, said if the agent in the order was using a public ChatGPT version, he probably didn’t understand that he lost control of the images the moment he uploaded them, allowing them to be part of the public domain and potentially used by bad actors.

Kinsey said from a technology standpoint most departments are building the plane as it’s being flown when it comes to AI. She said it’s often a pattern in law enforcement to wait until new technologies are already being used — and in some cases, mistakes being made — to then talk about putting guidelines or policies in place.

“You would rather do things the other way around, where you understand the risks and develop guardrails around the risks,” Kinsey said. “Even if they aren’t studying best practices, there’s some lower-hanging fruit that could help. We can start from transparency.”

Kinsey said while federal law enforcement considers how the technology should be used or not used, it could adopt a policy like those put in place in Utah or California recently, where police reports or communications written using AI have to be labeled.

Careful use of new tools

The photographs the officer used to generate a narrative also caused accuracy concerns for some experts.

Well-known tech companies like Axon have begun offering AI components with their body cameras to assist in writing incident reports. Those AI programs marketed to police operate on a closed system and largely limit themselves to using audio from body cameras to produce narratives because the companies have said programs that attempt to use visuals are not effective enough for use.

“There are many different ways to describe a color, or a facial expression or any visual component. You could ask any AI expert and they would tell you prompts return very different results between different AI applications, and that gets complicated with a visual component,” said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.

“There’s also a professionalism question. Are we OK with police officers using predictive analytics?” he added. “It’s about what the model thinks should have happened, but might not be what actually happened. You don’t want it to be what ends up in court, to justify your actions.”

Introduction

1. This appeal concerned the proper meaning of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR) (article 8).

2. A family of 6 persons resident in Gaza (father, mother and four children aged 18, 17, 8 and 7 in September 2024) (together the family) applied for entry clearance to come to the UK to join their sponsor, who was the younger brother of the father (the sponsor). The sponsor had lived and worked in the UK since 2007 and was now a British citizen.

3. The family's applications for entry clearance were refused in May 2024. Their appeals to the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (the FTT) were dismissed. The FTT decided that family life, within the meaning of article 8(1), had existed between the sponsor and the family since the start of the Gaza conflict in late 2023, but that the refusal of entry clearance was not a disproportionate interference with that family life under article 8(2) (see [21] to [27]).

4. The Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) (the UT) allowed the family's appeal from the FTT. The UT upheld the FTT's decision as to the existence of family life, but held that the decision to refuse the family entry to the UK infringed their article 8 rights (see [28] to [37]).

5. The Court of Appeal (Sir Geoffrey Vos, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Dingemans, Senior President of Tribunals, and Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing) upheld the SSHD's appeal. It held that: (i) that there was no family life established between the sponsor in the UK and the brother or the family in Gaza, (ii) even if such family life had been established, the family in Gaza would have had no free-standing article 8 rights of their own. The tribunals would, however, have had to consider the article 8 rights of the sponsor (his family life with the family) in considering under article 8(2) whether to admit the family to the UK, and (iii) had there been such family life, the proportionality balance would have weighed heavily in favour of refusing the family entry to the UK.

6. The terms of article 8 were very important. Article 8 provides that: ""[e]veryone has the right to respect for his … family life"", and ""[t]here shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of [the right to family life] except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of … the economic well-being of the country … or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others"". (see [7] to [8], [143], [158] to [161] and [166] to [168]).

The facts

7. The family is Palestinian and has lived in Gaza since 1994. The sponsor left Gaza in 2007 to live and work in the UK. During the conflict between Israel and Hamas, following the 7 October 2023 attacks, the family was displaced when their home was destroyed by an airstrike.

8. On 25 January 2024, the family applied for entry clearance to the UK. They filled in a Ukraine Family Scheme form, acknowledging that they could not qualify either under that scheme or under the Immigration Rules. They used the Ukraine Family Scheme Form because the SSHD's guidance told applicants to use the application form ""for the route which most closely matches [your] circumstances"".

9. At the time of the FTT hearing in September 2024, the family were living in the alMawasi humanitarian zone in Gaza. Later, they moved to the Nuseirat refugee camp, living in an unsuitable summer tent, which has been damaged by gunfire. Their position remains extremely dangerous. Law and order have broken down in Gaza, and there is a dire humanitarian situation. The family had an anti-Hamas profile, caused by the sponsor and the father having historically either been members of Fatah or worked for the Palestinian Authority. The sponsor suffers from PTSD, triggered by the risks to the family. The sponsor sent money to the family and intended to move home to accommodate the family in the UK, which he could afford to do.

The Court of Appeal's decision on the existence of family life between the sponsor and the family in Gaza

10. The Court of Appeal reaffirmed that permission to enter the UK outside the Rules was only to be granted in very exceptional or compelling circumstances (see [169]).

11. The Court of Appeal explained, at [38] to [85] and [113] to [136], that many cases in the European Court of Human Rights (the ECtHR) and the domestic courts established that: (i) family life for the purpose of article 8 was normally limited to the nuclear family, (ii) there was no family life between adult siblings unless they could demonstrate ""additional elements of dependence, involving more than the normal emotional ties"", (iii) the FTT and the UT had been wrong to ask themselves only whether the sponsor had provided ""real, effective or committed support"" to his brother and the family, and (iv) applying the proper test, neither the brother nor his family had demonstrated that they had sufficient family life with the sponsor to engage article 8(1).

The Court of Appeal's decision on the article 8 rights of persons outside the territory of the ECHR, seeking to enter the UK on the grounds of family life with UK citizens

12. This point was academic in the light of the first decision that there was no family life between the sponsor and the family. The Court of Appeal nonetheless held, at [137] to [144], that persons outside the territory of the ECHR did not have free-standing article 8 rights even if they enjoyed family life with a UK citizen. In undertaking the necessary proportionality balance under article 8(2) (i.e. to decide whether it was lawful to infringe any right to family life established), the tribunals ought to look primarily at the article 8 rights of those persons within the territory of the ECHR (in this case, the sponsor). The tribunals ought, however, in deciding where the balance lay, to consider the sponsor's family life as unitary with the family.

The Court of Appeal's decision on where the proportionality balance lay under article 8(2)

13. The UT had made several errors in undertaking the proportionality balance under article 8(2) (see [145] to [168]). Even if family life had existed between the sponsor and the family (which the Court of Appeal had held it did not), the balance should not have been determined in favour of granting the family entry clearance. Exceptional or compelling circumstances had not been shown. The UT had been wrong to pay so little regard to the immigration control policies of the SSHD and the UK Government, as reflected in the Rules, as expressing what was necessary in the interests of the economic well-being of the UK and for the protection of the rights of the citizens of the UK. The UT wrongly over-stated the importance of the family's short-lived family life with the sponsor (had it existed at all), the best interests of the children of the family and the admittedly serious risks faced by the family in Gaza.

14. The UT's close focus on the effect that the war was having on the family wrongly distorted the article 8(2) balance in the family's favour (see [166]). The words of article 8(2) were not given their proper effect. Article 8(2) does not prohibit interference by a public authority with the exercise of the right to family life, if that interference is ""in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of … the economic well-being of the country … or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others"". Immigration control is to be assumed to be in the public interest and protective of the economic well-being of the country.

15. The SSHD's policy is a matter for her and for the UK Government (see [167]-[168]). It was not a question of floodgates or numbers likely to apply from warzones across the world. It was a question of respect for the UK's laws and democratic process. The decision as to what was necessary in UK society to protect the economic well-being of the UK and the rights of citizens of the UK was the business of the SSHD and the Government. The courts must attach considerable weight to the SSHD's immigration policies at a general level, alongside considering all the factors which are relevant to the particular case. Those policies did not include a resettlement policy concerning Gaza. Had they done so, the balance might have been struck differently.

Conclusion

16. The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal remade the decision of the FTT (which was upheld by the UT) as to the existence of family life within the autonomous meaning in article 8(1). It decided than no family life existed between the sponsor in the UK, and his family in Gaza (see [130] to [136]).

17. Had the Court of Appeal held that that family life existed between the sponsor and the family in Gaza (as the FTT and UT held), it would have determined that there were no very exceptional or compelling circumstances justifying the grant of entry clearance to the family outside the Rules, or, to put the matter another way, it would have determined that refusal of entry clearance was not a disproportionate interference with the family life, had it existed (see [169] to [175]).

18. The SSHD was granted permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal notwithstanding that she had already agreed to provide entry clearance to the family, because the appeal raised points of general importance. Accordingly, allowing the appeal will have no effect on the family's situation.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Royal_Court2.jpg/640px-Royal_Court2.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 20:56:57.551840

Bruna Caroline Ferreira was arrested on Nov. 12 in Revere, Mass., a city roughly seven miles north of Boston, according to reporting by CNN and CNN affiliate WMUR.

Ferreira is the mother of Karoline's nephew, whom she shares with the press secretary's brother Michael Leavitt. According to reporting by CNN, she was driving to pick up her son from Michael's house in New Hampshire when she was detained.

In a statement shared with PEOPLE, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that Ferreira, who was born in Brazil, had been arrested. They reported that her tourist visa expired in 1999.

""She entered the U.S. on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the U.S. by June 6, 1999,"" the spokesperson wrote.

Additionally, they alleged that Ferreira ""has a previous arrest for battery."" However, details about the arrest were unclear. WBUR, a public broadcaster and news outlet affiliated with Boston University, noted that they were unable to find any criminal charges filed against her in Massachusetts' online database.

Todd Pomerleau, who is representing Ferreira, disputed the claim, telling WMUR, ""Bruna has no criminal record whatsoever.""

""Show us the proof. There's no charges out there. She's not a criminal, illegal alien, we're hearing that said about anyone who's not a U.S. citizen,"" he continued.

A source familiar with the situation told PEOPLE that Ferreira's son lived full-time in New Hampshire with Michael and had never lived with Ferreira. They added that Ferreira and Karoline ""have not spoken in many years.""

The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told PEOPLE that Ferreira ""is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings.""

They added, ""Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.""

Pomerleau told CNN that his client was formerly protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which covers immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. He said that she had been going through a ""lawful immigration process"" to attain citizenship.

He added that Ferreira wasn't able to renew her DACA status after Trump unsuccessfully attempted to eliminate the program during his first term.

Ferreira's sister Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues opened a GoFundMe to support the family in their fight to keep Ferreira from being deported.

""Bruna was brought to the United States by our parents in December of 1998, when she was just a child, entering on a visa. Since then, she has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here. She has maintained her legal status through DACA, followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing,"" she wrote in a description on the fundraiser.

Continuing, she wrote, ""Anyone who knows Bruna knows the kind of person she is. She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it. Whether it’s supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.""

She noted that her sister's ""absence has been especially painful for her 11-year-old son,"" writing that he ""needs his mother and hopes every single day that she’ll be home in time for the holidays.""

Michael spoke to WMUR, confirming the situation and noting that his son had not been in contact with Ferreira since she was detained.

The outlet reported that he described the situation as ""difficult,"" adding that ""his biggest concern is his son's safety and well-being.""

Ferreira has an arrest record for battery, the spokesperson added, without providing further details.

Pomerleau contradicted the DHS spokesperson and told local CNN affiliate, WMUR, that Ferreira “has no criminal record whatsoever” and is not in the country illegally.

“I don’t know where that is coming from. Show us the proof. There’s no charges out there. She’s not a criminal, illegal alien, we’re hearing that said about anyone who’s not a U.S. citizen,” he said.

Ferreira has never lived with her son, who, according to sources, lives full-time with his dad and stepmother in New Hampshire. Ferreira and Leavitt have not been in contact for years, reports CNN.

Ferreira’s lawyer told the outlet that she was a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which temporarily protects those brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts during his first term to end the program meant Ferreira was unable to renew her status. She is currently in the midst of a “lawful immigration process” for U.S. citizenship, Pomerleau said, adding that she is a good mother and that he was “fighting” to get her released from custody.

“She should not be sitting in a jail hours away from her family and from her child’s life. She’s a great mom, and from what I heard, I think he’s been a pretty good dad,” he told WMUR.

Ferreira was detained while driving to pick up her son, according to Pomerleau.

Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the Boston Globe she was “suddenly swarmed” by immigration agents who demanded her name and driver’s licence, but Ferreira did not have any ID.

“They were not the most gentle with her,” she said, describing her sister as “more American than anything else.”

Michael Leavitt told WMUR on Tuesday that his primary concern was the safety and well-being of their son, who he said has not spoken to his mother since she was taken into custody a few weeks ago.

His mother is currently detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ferreira’s sister created a GoFundMe page to cover legal fees and expenses accrued as a result of her arrest. As of Wednesday morning, it had raised over $18,000.

“My family is going through one of the most difficult moments of our lives, and we’re reaching out with a humble plea for help. My sister, Bruna, was recently detained by immigration and is now fighting to stay in the country she has called home for nearly her entire life,” the fundraising description reads.

Ferreira was brought to the U.S. by their parents in 1998 and has always maintained her legal status through DACA, her sister wrote, before describing her as a “hardworking” and “kind” person who puts others before herself.

On Wednesday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) issued a notice in the Federal Register revealing its intent to sever Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for Haitians on February 3.

end of list

Some 352,959 Haitian nationals and stateless people of Haitian origin are expected to be affected, according to government estimates.

The notice, currently in draft form, will become official on Friday.

In explaining its decision, the Department of Homeland Security sought to walk a fine line. On one hand, it argued that violent gang activity and instability in Haiti were national security threats to the US.

On the other, it maintained that conditions in Haiti were safe enough to merit the return of the Haitians currently shielded by TPS.

Nixing the programme for Haitian nationals, the department said, would be akin to giving a vote of confidence to Haiti’s future.

“Ending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti reflects a necessary and strategic vote of confidence in the new chapter Haiti is turning,” the notice said.

“The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.”

Temporary Protected Status is a short-term protection granted to foreign applicants who are already in the US but find that conditions in their home country have become unsafe due to conflict, disaster or other emergency circumstances.

The programme allows recipients to remain in the country legally and receive authorisation to work.

At the start of the year, citizens of 17 countries were protected by different TPS programmes, including Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.

But the Trump administration has sought to eliminate many of the TPS designations, arguing that they run contrary to US national interests.

The rollback is part of a larger trend to curtail immigration into the US and implement what Trump has promised will be the “largest deportation in the history of our country”.

But critics warn that revoking TPS and refusing to extend protections will send some foreign nationals back into dangerous situations, where their lives could be in peril.

A humanitarian crisis

The TPS programme for Haitian citizens was originally opened on January 21, 2010, shortly after a catastrophic, 7.0-magnitude earthquake shook the island country.

Nearly 222,570 people were killed, and more than 1.3 million were displaced from their homes, according to US government statistics.

That same year, Haiti experienced its first outbreak of cholera in nearly a century. An estimated 10,000 deaths were linked to the disease’s spread at the time, and a new resurgence since 2022 has killed thousands more.

Haiti is considered the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere, and it has long struggled with inadequate housing, food scarcity and insufficient health services.

Those problems have been compounded by corruption and upheaval in the Haitian government as well as the spread of gang violence.

In 2019, national elections were indefinitely postponed, and in 2021, then-President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in Petionville. No president has replaced him since, and a round of national elections was again postponed from this year to late 2026.

The last democratically elected officials in the Haitian National Assembly saw their terms expire in 2023.

A nine-member transitional presidential council currently holds governing power, but its mandate is slated to expire in February.

In the absence of government leadership, gangs and other criminal organisations have spread in Haiti, taking control of as much as 90 percent of the capital, Port-au-Prince.

Human rights abuses have proliferated as the gangs expanded their reach. Just this year, from April to June, at least 1,617 people were killed in the violence. In 2024, the death toll was 5,600, an increase over 2023.

At least 1.4 million people are currently displaced from their homes as a result of the fighting.

Court challenges

But Trump officials have argued that the previous administration, under President Joe Biden, exceeded its authority in approving repeated TPS extensions for Haitians and other foreign groups.

Trump has accused Biden of allowing unfettered immigration into the US and has sought to reverse some of his predecessor’s efforts.

In July 2024, the Biden administration approved the most recent TPS extension for Haitians, allowing the protections to continue for an additional 18 months.

But in February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, under Trump’s authority, announced she would “partially vacate” the extension, cutting it from 18 months to 12.

That would have forced Haitians with TPS to leave the country or find alternative immigration pathways no later than September 2.

The US State Department currently lists Haiti under a category-four travel advisory, indicating the highest level of danger. It cites the current state of emergency in the country and notes that there are threats from “kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest and limited health care”.

“Do not travel to Haiti for any reason,” the State Department advises on its website.

Plaintiffs have pointed to that fact to argue that curtailing the extension is not only illegal but also irresponsible.

“Revoking Haitians’ legal immigration status that has kept them safe with their families in the US is cruel and dangerous,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement earlier this year, as she and 18 other state prosecutors filed an amicus brief to stop the TPS revocation.

“Haitian immigrants have contributed immensely to our communities, neighborhoods and local economies, and without them, New York and this nation would not be the same.”

Some of the legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision have raised the question of racial animus.

While campaigning for re-election in 2024, for instance, Trump spread unfounded and racist claims about Haitian immigrants in the US, including that they eat neighbourhood pets.

In July, a federal court in New York heard one of the cases against shortening the TPS extension, known as Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association v Trump.

Judge Brian Coban ruled that shortening the timeline was “arbitrary and capricious” and “violated plaintiffs’ due process rights”.

His ruling, however, left open the possibility that the Trump administration could simply let the existing extension period expire, as it does in Wednesday’s notice.

Arguing for expiration

The notice announcing the end of the TPS protections makes several arguments for why an end to the programme is necessary, at least according to Noem.

“The Secretary has determined that while the current situation in Haiti is concerning, the United States must prioritize its national interests,” the notice said. “Permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the U.S. national interest.”

It also described Judge Coban’s decision in July as “interference” in the work of the executive branch.

The notice asserts Noem has “determined that there are no extraordinary and temporary conditions in Haiti” that should prevent TPS recipients from “returning in safety”.

But “even if the Department found that there existed conditions that were extraordinary”, it maintained that national security concerns prevented the government from extending the TPS programme.

Undocumented immigrants from Haiti continue to arrive in high numbers to the US, the notice said.

It also pointed to the threat of Haitian gangs and organised crime. Earlier this year, the Trump administration labelled two Haitian groups, Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif, as “foreign terrorist organisations”, as part of a larger crackdown against Latin American criminal networks.

The notice also highlighted the absence of a central government in Haiti. “This lack of government control has not only destabilized Haiti internally but has also had direct consequences for US public safety,” it said.

Still, it underscored Noem’s belief that there have been “positive developments” in Haiti.

In October, for example, the United Nations Security Council approved the creation of a Gang Suppression Force to help bolster Haiti’s police.

That initiative would replace a Kenya-led, UN-endorsed multinational mission that has struggled to make a dent in Haiti’s gang violence.

The notice argued that offering TPS protections would undermine goals for Haiti’s recovery.

“Our immigration policy must align with our foreign policy vision of a secure, sovereign, and self-reliant Haiti,” the notice said.

Nonetheless, its assessment of Haiti’s safety was measured. Only “parts of the country are suitable to return to,” it said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25181641413209-1764182394.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-26 15:57:21.129211

FIRST ON FOX: Top brass at the Department of Homeland Security told Fox News Digital the agency’s Investigations unit is now on the case of a Virginia educator and his brother accused of plotting to attack ICE, potentially with explosive rounds.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Wednesday that Kempsville High School assistant principal John Wilson Bennett and his older brother Mark Booth Bennett were overheard at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach allegedly conspiring to go to Nevada and plan attacks on ICE agents in retribution for what they claimed to be ""kidnapping[s]"" of civilians during recent immigration enforcement operations.

""It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers—offering such specifics as to getting a high-caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,"" McLaughlin said, after Fox News Digital originally reported on the adult brothers’ arrest days ago.

""Thanks to Homeland Security Investigations and our partners, these men are behind bars.""

FLORIDA MAN NABBED BY HOMELAND SECURITY FOR ALLEGEDLY MAKING ONLINE DEATH THREATS AGAINST ICE 'GESTAPO'

John Bennett has been faculty at the school, located in the inland part of Virginia Beach, since 2009. The school told local press that he is currently on leave.

McLaughlin said DHS worked with law enforcement at all levels after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia Beach on Nov. 17 discussing plans to ""kill police officers and ICE agents,"" with Mark Bennett allegedly saying he was planning to meet like-minded people in Las Vegas, where he would also purchase firearms with explosive rounds.

Two days later, Mark Bennett was arrested at Norfolk International Airport en route to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, to connect to Las Vegas. John Bennett was also arrested that day.

McLaughlin said the case is indicative of the more-than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE agents and 8,000-fold spike in death threats as they go about their daily work defending the homeland.

""They risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst, including murderers, rapists, pedophiles, terrorists, and gang members. From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families,"" McLaughlin said.

Happy O’Brien, Mark Bennett’s attorney, disputed the recounting of events, reportedly saying his client was instead flying to Nevada for a F1 (Formula One) motorsports event with his child, according to the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot.

O’Brien reportedly compared the restaurant conversation to something out of the NBC sitcom ""Seinfeld"" – where Jerry Seinfeld’s and Jason Alexander’s characters would often have varying degrees of existential conversations while having coffee at ""Monk’s.""

Any Lucia Lopez Belloca, 19, was at Logan Airport on Nov. 20 when she was informed for the first time that she had a removal order from immigration authorities, according to her lawyer, Todd Pomerlau.

At 4 p.m., she called her family and told them she was being held at the ICE field office in Burlington.

As of Wednesday, she is currently in Honduras.

""When she got to the airport to board her flight, she was asked to step aside by federal agencies because they alleged that she had a final order of removal,"" said Nayna Gupta, a member of the American Immigration Council. ""These are folks who may have received removal notices when they were children and were never told.""

In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said:

All governments whose economies benefit from migrant workers’ labor should avoid the risk of further sanctions by taking steps to end practices that cause misery to thousands.","United Nations human rights experts have highlighted “widespread and systematic” exploitation, deception, and deepening debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.

Over 800,000 Bangladeshis have Malaysian work permits, making them the largest group of documented foreign workers in the country. According to information received by the UN, thousands of workers are stranded in Bangladesh or face exploitation in Malaysia after some paid recruitment fees five times higher than the official rate.

Other abuses, including confiscation of passports by Malaysian employers, false job promises, discrepancies between contracts and promised employment packages, and a lack of support from responsible government agencies, are common in Malaysia.

Workers without proper documentation are at risk of arrest, detention, ill-treatment, and deportation under Malaysia’s draconian immigration act, which criminalizes irregular entry, and other anti-migrant policies. Malaysian authorities conduct frequent immigration raids and hold an estimated 18,000 migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in immigration detention centers.

The United States has previously issued import restrictions against Malaysian factories. Meanwhile the European Union’s Forced Labour Regulation, taking effect in 2027, introduces curbs on the trade of goods produced with forced labor. Debt bondage and deception of workers could lead to prohibitions on the sale of sanctioned goods under the new regulation.

The Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments, as well as those of other labor-sending or receiving countries and those where buying companies are headquartered such as the US, EU members, and the United Kingdom, have obligations to ensure labor migration is conducted in a way that protects workers’ rights. Malaysia and labor-sending governments like Bangladesh should implement the UN experts’ call to promptly investigate reported abuses and provide effective remedies. The experts emphasized that “involuntary repatriations and any form of reprisals” against migrant workers violate international human rights obligations.

International buyers sourcing from Malaysia should use the Fair Labor Association’s Guidance for Responsible Recruitment for companies as a model. The guidance urges buyers to “include costs of responsible recruitment in their purchasing metrics” and ensure that their suppliers include those costs in their invoicing. Buyers should also support migrant workers’ access to legal aid.

Nine media organizations have faced federal investigations, lawsuits, threats to revoke their broadcast licenses and limits on access to White House events.","The second form was threats. Trump and his administration targeted at least 46 individuals, businesses and other entities with threats of investigations or penalties, including freezing federal funds for Democratic-led cities such as New York and Chicago.

Trump openly discussed firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for resisting interest rate cuts, for instance. Last week, he threatened to have six Democratic members of Congress tried for sedition – a crime he said is “punishable by DEATH” – after the lawmakers reminded military personnel they can refuse “illegal orders.” This week, the Defense Department threatened to court-martial one of them, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, a former Naval officer.

The third form was coercion. In at least a dozen cases, organizations such as law firms and universities signed agreements with the government to roll back diversity initiatives or other policies after facing administration threats of punishment, such as security clearance revocations and loss of federal funding and contracts.

It’s a campaign led from the top: Trump’s White House has issued at least 36 orders, decrees and directives, targeting at least 100 individuals and entities with punitive actions, according to the Reuters analysis.

Trump openly campaigned on a platform of revenge in his latest run for the presidency, promising to punish enemies of his Make America Great Again movement. ""For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,"" he said in a March 2023 speech. Weeks later, while campaigning in Texas, he repeated the theme. “I am your justice,” he said.

Today, the White House disputes the idea that the administration is out for revenge. It describes recent investigations and indictments of political adversaries as valid course corrections on policy, necessary probes of wrongdoing and legitimate policy initiatives.

“This entire article is based on the flawed premise that enforcing an electoral mandate is somehow ‘retribution.’ It’s not,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. There is no place in government for civil servants or public officials “who actively seek to undermine the agenda that the American people elected the president to enact,” she added. Trump is abiding by campaign promises to restore a justice system that was “weaponized” by the Biden administration, Jackson said, and “ensure taxpayer funding is not going to partisan causes.”

Trump’s actions have been cheered by his staunchest backers. Right-wing commentator and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon told Reuters the use of government power to punish Trump’s enemies is “not revenge at all” but an attempt to “hold people accountable” for what he said were unfair investigations targeting Trump. More is on the way, he said.

“The people that tried to take away President Trump's first term, that accused him of being a Russian asset and damaged this republic, and then stole the 2020 election – they're going to be held accountable and they're going to be adjudicated in courts of law,” he said in an interview. “That's coming. There's no doubt.” There’s no evidence the 2020 election was stolen.

“For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”

Trump’s allies point to actions former President Joe Biden took upon taking office. After Trump’s supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his election loss, Biden revoked Trump’s access to classified information, a first for any former president. Biden also won a court battle to dismiss Senate-confirmed directors of independent agencies serving fixed terms, such as the Federal Housing Finance Authority, and removed scores of Trump-era appointees from unpaid advisory boards.

Yet the scale and systematic nature of Trump’s effort to punish perceived enemies marks a sharp break from long-standing norms in U.S. governance, according to 13 political scientists and legal scholars interviewed by Reuters. Some historians say the closest modern parallel, though inexact, is the late President Richard Nixon’s quest for vengeance against political enemies. Since May, for instance, dozens of officials from multiple federal agencies have been meeting as part of a task force formed to advance Trump’s retribution drive against perceived enemies, Reuters previously reported.

“The main aim is concentration of power and destruction of all checks against power,” said Daron Acemoglu, Nobel laureate in economics and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which faces an ongoing federal investigation for embracing diversity and equity programs. “Retribution is just one of the tools.”

Dozens of Trump’s targets have challenged their punishments as illegal. Fired and suspended civil servants have filed administrative appeals or legal challenges claiming wrongful termination. Some law firms have gone to court claiming the administration exceeded its legal authority by restricting their ability to work on classified contracts or interact with federal agencies. Most of those challenges remain unresolved.

Investigating foes of Trump

The administration has moved aggressively against officials in the government’s legal and national security agencies, institutions central to investigations of Trump’s alleged misconduct during and after his first term.

At least 69 current and former officials were targeted for investigating or sounding alarms about Russian interference in U.S. elections. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded soon after the 2016 election that Moscow sought to tilt the race toward Trump, a finding later affirmed by a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report in August 2020. Acts of retribution tied to the Russia probe include the September 25 indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, a break from Justice Department norms meant to shield prosecutions from political influence.

Comey, who led the FBI’s investigation into Trump’s 2016 campaign, was charged after Trump demanded his prosecution. The Justice Department has cast the case as a corruption crackdown. Comey and his lawyers said in court documents that the case was “vindictive” and motivated by “personal animus.” Comey, who pleaded not guilty, declined to comment. A federal judge dismissed the case on Monday, ruling that Trump’s handpicked prosecutor had been unlawfully appointed.

At least 58 acts of retribution have targeted people Trump viewed as saboteurs of his election campaigns, including Chris Krebs, the top cybersecurity official during his first term. Trump fired him in 2020 for disputing claims that the election was rigged. In April, Trump stripped Krebs’ security clearance and ordered a federal investigation into his tenure. Krebs, still asserting that Trump’s defeat was valid, has vowed to fight the probe. He did not respond for this story.

“This kind of political retribution leads to a loss of trust, which ultimately leads to a failure of governing.”

Reuters documented 112 security clearances revoked from current and former U.S. officials, law firms and state leaders – credentials needed for work that involves classified information. In August, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced she was revoking 37 clearances.

In a response to Reuters posted on X, an agency spokesperson said Gabbard and Trump are working “to ensure the government is never again wielded against the American people it is meant to serve.” She added: “President Trump said it best, ‘Our ultimate retribution is success.’”

Leon Panetta, CIA director and defense secretary under former President Barack Obama, had his security clearance revoked in January along with others who signed an October 2020 letter suggesting Russia may have been behind reports about emails on Hunter Biden’s laptop. At the time, Joe Biden – Hunter’s father – was Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2020 election. An executive order Trump signed in January claimed: ""The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions."" Panetta has said he stands by signing the letter.

Panetta told Reuters he had already surrendered his clearance after leaving government nearly a decade ago. Trump’s retribution campaign is hurting CIA morale and wrecking the bipartisan trust that allows Washington to function, Panetta said. “What I worry about is that our adversaries will look at what’s happening and sense weakness,” he said. “This kind of political retribution leads to a loss of trust, which ultimately leads to a failure of governing.” The CIA did not respond to a request for comment.

The revenge effort also reaches deep into the civil service, punishing employees who speak out against Trump’s policies and turning forms of dissent that were tolerated by past administrations into grounds for discipline.

This summer, hundreds of Environmental Protection Agency staffers wrote an open letter protesting deep cuts to pollution control and cleanup programs. The fallout was swift. More than 100 signers who attached their names were placed on paid leave. At least 15 senior officials and probationary employees were told they would be fired. The rest were informed they were under investigation for misconduct, leading to at least 69 suspensions without pay. Many remained out of work for weeks.

“They followed all the rules” of conduct for civil servants, said Nicole Cantello, one of the signers and an officer with the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents many affected workers. She called the punishments an attempt to “quell dissent,” stifle free speech and “scare the employees.” In a statement, the EPA said it has “a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage, and undercut” administration policy.

At the Federal Emergency Management Agency, about 20 staffers were put on leave and now face misconduct investigations after signing a letter criticizing the agency’s decision to scrap bipartisan reforms adopted years ago to speed disaster relief. Cameron Hamilton, a Republican who served briefly as acting head of FEMA, was fired in May, a day after telling Congress he didn’t believe the agency should be shut down, contradicting the administration.

Hamilton told Reuters he still supports Trump. But he said too many senior officials are firing people in the name of retribution, trying to impress the White House. “They want to find ways to really launch themselves to prominence and be movers and shakers, to kick ass and take names,” said Hamilton. “They’re trying to show the president ‘look at what I am doing for you.’”

In a statement to Reuters, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes FEMA, said it is building a “new FEMA” to fix “inefficiency and outdated processes.” Employees “resisting change” are “not a good fit,” the statement said.

Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, former head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, sees her firing in October – three weeks after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging politicization of research and vaccine policy – as a warning shot. She told Reuters the administration’s purge of dissenting health officials is breeding “anticipatory obedience” – a reflex to comply before being asked. “People know if they push back … this is what happens,” she said. The effect, she says, is an ecosystem of fear: those who stay in government self-censor; those who speak out are branded “radioactive, too hot to handle.”

The Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that oversees NIAID, did not respond to a request for comment.

Federal agency leaders have dismissed a wide array of officials they deemed out of step with Trump’s MAGA agenda, including employees involved in diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and those working on transgender issues.

David Maltinsky, a Federal Bureau of Investigation employee, says he was fired by Director Kash Patel for displaying a Pride flag at work – one of at least 50 bureau personnel dismissed on Patel’s watch. Maltinsky sued the FBI and Justice Department, alleging violations of his constitutional rights and seeking reinstatement. The Justice Department has yet to file a formal response.

In his 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” Patel named 60 people that he said were members of an “Executive Branch deep state” that opposed Trump, including former Democratic government officials and Republicans who served in Trump’s first administration but eventually broke with him. He called for firings and said that anybody who abused their authority should face prosecution. In his 2025 confirmation hearing before Congress, Patel denied that it was an “enemies list.”

Reuters found that at least 17 of the 60 people on Patel’s list have faced some sort of retribution, including firings and stripping of security clearances. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

Against perceived foes in the private sector, the administration has wielded financial penalties as leverage. At least two dozen law firms faced inquiries, investigations or restrictions on federal contracting, often for employing or representing people tied to past cases against Trump. Eight struck deals to avoid further action.

Nine media organizations have faced federal investigations, lawsuits, threats to revoke their broadcast licenses and limits on access to White House events. Trump has also suggested revoking broadcast licenses for networks whose coverage he dislikes.

The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status.

On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students' financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.

In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.

In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law.

As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.

To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.

Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable.

‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’

Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.

On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.

After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted.

In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding.

Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.

Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs.

Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma.

Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win

The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.

Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.

Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.

The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.

However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.

The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.

But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition.

All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can.

In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then.

“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.

Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.

What’s likely next

California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice.

Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.

Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.

A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.

The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said.

For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility.

In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.

College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.”

The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.

Adventist Health White Memorial says it is taking steps to reaffirm its commitment to patient privacy in the face of ICE raids — including posting signs clarifying how law enforcement officers and immigration agents interact with patients.

The announcement comes after reports that hospital administrators allowed federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

The reporting alarmed many in the community, who are calling for hospital administrators to uphold patient privacy and ensure staff can advocate for patients without retaliation. An ICE Out of White Memorial petition has garnered hundreds of signatures, organizers said.

In a Nov. 21 news release, Adventist Health released a six-point statement outlining policies to protect patients and support staff. The measures state that staff can speak up if patient rights are violated, and that they will not face retaliation for “requesting ICE agents to step away.” Staff are encouraged to report any violations of patient rights, according to the release.

The statement also said nursing and clinical care teams “routinely ask ICE agents to leave the room during care so patients can maintain privacy and feel safe when receiving medical care.”

“We support our staff when they speak up for patients’ needs,” it said, adding that the hospital does not prohibit contact with patient families. “We have case management and escalation processes for our physicians and staff to be able to contact families and coordinate care,” according to the news release.

The statement follows reporting by LAist that found that doctors believe hospital administrators were allowing ICE to call the shots and were blocking doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care. The hospital, which is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, has operated in Boyle Heights for more than 100 years.

LAist’s reporting found that White Memorial staff who stand up to immigration agents – either by asking them to identify themselves or to step out of the room during a patient examination – do so at their own peril and are unsure that the hospital has their back if a conflict arises. Doctors also said they have been barred from reaching out to family members, either to collect necessary medical information, or simply to let family members know about a loved one.

The new statement was released on Friday, but doctors told Boyle Heights Beat that ICE is still interfering with patient care — in seeming contradiction to Adventist Health’s Nov. 21 news release. Physicians say they have been told they must go through the hospital’s case management system to speak with a patient’s family members. The case management system then contacts ICE for permission, doctors said. ICE can say no, they said.

Community advocates have voiced concern about the hospital’s approach and say this recent statement, while welcomed, doesn’t go far enough.

Raquel Roman, executive director of Proyecto Pastoral, which operates the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network, said that while the organization recognizes White Memorial’s efforts, they want the hospital to “set clear rules prohibiting agents from entering patient care areas.”

“At a time when moral clarity is needed, leaving these decisions to individual care teams creates grave ambiguity. Hospitals need to be havens of healing,” Roman said.

“When people are scared to seek life-saving care, there is no impartial position. We cherish our collaboration with White Memorial. But we can’t stand by and watch while our neighbors have to decide between their safety and health,” she added.

The news release also underscores the community’s clout following outrage over the doctors’ complaints.

Since the story was published, community stakeholders who are part of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network presented demands at a Nov. 5 meeting with hospital leaders, including Kerry Heinrich, the president and chief executive officer of Adventist Health System, and John Raffoul, president of Adventist Health White Memorial.

As part of those demands, the network — which is made up of residents and community leaders from organizations like Legacy LA, InnerCity Struggle and Centro CSO — wants immigration agents out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures.

In response, White Memorial, in a Nov. 12 memo, thanked community leaders for sharing their concerns and outlined five key points, which noted that every patient’s privacy is protected, that doctors and nurses make care decisions together with patients, that law enforcement officers can’t interfere with medical care, and that when there is a medical reason to contact a family, “our team can do that through the right process.”

Members of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network said the memo fell short. While a “good first attempt,” they said it contained “a lot of gray area” and was doing the “bare minimum.” As a hospital, “they already should be protecting patients’ privacy,” said Henry Perez, executive director of InnerCity Struggle.

Adventist Health said the statement combines existing practices with recent changes made in response to community concerns. The updated signage referenced in the news release will be printed and posted by Monday evening, they said.

“We have and will continue to review our policies and practices – including those guiding detainee and patient privacy – so that every patient, family member, and staff member at White Memorial feels safe and respected in our hospital,” according to the press release.

One of L.A.’s biggest homeless service providers has been awarded over $100 million in taxpayer funds while failing to comply with federal audit mandates, according to an LAist review of federal government records.

The downtown L.A.-based nonprofit Weingart Center is at the heart of a controversial property purchase under federal investigation and discussed in a recent criminal indictment of the developer who sold the property.

LAist found Weingart Center also has been continuously out of compliance with federal deadlines to turn in audits — known as “single audits” — since early 2022, based on a review of records in the federal database where they have to be uploaded.

The audits for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 were each finished a year and a half after the federal deadlines, according to the dates on those reviews. The audits show multiple failures by Weingart Center to properly account for taxpayer money that were not remedied from one year to the next.

The group still has not filed an audit that was due nine months ago for its fiscal year ending in April 2024, according to the federal database and L.A.’s regional homeless services agency.

Consequences for failing to turn in a single audit by the deadline can be significant. Federal agencies can cut off any further funds to groups that are overdue, and L.A.’s homeless services agency can do the same, according to a contract with Weingart Center.

Weingart Center has received over $100 million in taxpayer funds while it’s been out of compliance with turning in the audits, according to its latest public tax filing and an LAist review of the audits.

Among the funds the group received while out of compliance is a $9 million no-bid contract L.A. Mayor Karen Bass’ office directed officials to award Weingart Center in 2023 to run the largest shelter site in her signature homelessness program.

A Weingart Center audit also was overdue when the mayor and state officials greenlit the group’s taxpayer-funded purchase of a senior living facility in Cheviot Hills. Federal prosecutors earlier this month announced charges against the man who sold the property to Weingart Center.

Former state Sen. Kevin Murray, who has been Weingart Center’s president and CEO since 2011, has not returned LAist’s messages seeking comment.

Murray and Weingart Center’s chief of real estate development, Ben Rosen, have been placed on leave, according to the L.A. Times. Rosen also has not responded to LAist’s request for comment.

The nonprofit’s board has commissioned an outside investigation into the valuation of housing projects, Weingart Center spokesperson Stefan Friedman told LAist. He did not respond to questions about the audit failures.

Murray previously served in the state Legislature with Bass, who has not responded to a request for comment for this story.

Murray is an attorney and a licensed real estate broker. In addition to leading Weingart Center, he also has a local government role overseeing homelessness spending in the region.

Bass appointed him to the board that oversees hundreds of millions a year in government spending on housing and other programs from the Measure A tax approved by L.A. County voters last year.

The spending panel — known as LACAHSA — oversees just over a third of the roughly $1 billion expected to be generated each year from Measure A. Its job is to create new affordable homes, preserve existing lower-rent housing and prevent people from losing the housing they already have.

This September, Bass also nominated Rosen — the Weignart Center real estate chief — to the spending board as an alternative city appointee to step in when Murray can’t attend. She withdrew that nomination a few days after federal authorities announced their investigation into the property flip.

‘Disappointed’ it wasn’t caught sooner

A large share of the federal money Weingart Center received was distributed by the L.A. Homeless Services Authority, a joint city-county agency known as LAHSA.

LAHSA’s contract requirements say its vendors, like Weingart Center, have to comply with the single audit requirements in federal law. Those requirements say organizations that receive a certain amount of federal money — such as Weingart Center — have to submit the audits within nine months after their fiscal year ends.

Single audits are “the single most important way” to assess an organization’s ability to manage federal dollars, federal officials say.

Among other things, they check whether a group has an accounting system to accurately document the spending.

Weingart Center was long overdue turning in two annual audits for 2023 and 2024 to LAHSA when LAist contacted LAHSA on Oct. 23.

Weingart Center has since submitted its 2023 audit to LAHSA, but the 2024 audit remains overdue.

“We are currently evaluating options regarding next steps,” LAHSA spokesperson Ahmad Chapman told LAist on Nov. 20.

LAHSA’s new interim CEO, Gita O’Neill, told LAist she’s “disappointed” the homeless services authority didn’t catch Weingart Center’s late audits earlier and that she’s been working to beef up oversight of contractors.

O’Neill said LAHSA sent a notice of non-compliance to Weingart Center about the overdue audit and is reviewing the late-submitted audits to see “if additional action is needed.”

At the October meeting of LAHSA’s governing commission, O’Neill shared a plan to improve the agency’s oversight of contracts, which she told LAist will strengthen oversight over issues like single audits. O’Neill, who started at LAHSA in late August, said the reorganization plan would roll out publicly in a few weeks later.

“Every member of this reorganized team will receive training for their new role so we can more effectively hold our [service] providers to the standards we set for them,” O’Neill said. “This is an important step toward holding ourselves and our providers more accountable.”

What state officials say

Aside from LAHSA, the other major agency awarding federal dollars to Weingart Center is the state’s Department of Housing & Community Development, or HCD.

Records show HCD awarded tens of millions of dollars in federally funded grants to Weingart Center under the state’s Homekey program while the group has been out of compliance with turning in the audits.

In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for HCD said Weingart Center was not out of compliance with its award-granting process, which the agency called “very thorough.”

HCD’s agreement with Weingart Center for a 2024 grant says the nonprofit is responsible for complying with the single audit requirements.

The HCD spokesperson said the state housing agency is not responsible for reviewing the federal audits. Instead, the spokesperson said the audits are received and reviewed by the state controller’s office, which then identifies issues and discusses them with HCD.

The controller’s office told LAist it did not receive single audits from Weingart Center or any other nonprofit.

Problems found in latest available audit

The most recent available single audit of Weingart Center, covering fiscal year 2023, was not completed until July 2025, a year and a half after it was due.

That audit report, which LAist obtained from LAHSA, said Weingart Center followed the most important requirements for nonprofits receiving federal funds but also found a range of accounting failures.

The problems identified by auditors included:

Weingart Center did not include over $50 million in federally funded grants, via HCD’s Homekey program, on the list of federal dollars it handled. The review also found Weingart Center failed to have its financial records checked for accuracy by someone who didn’t prepare them, auditors wrote.

Weingart Center did not have an accounting team with enough experience or size to handle housing developments, the review found — despite the problem being flagged in the prior year’s audit. This was one of six problems identified in the previous year's audit that the 2023 audit showed as ongoing.

Other repeat issues flagged by the audit include Weingart Center failing to properly document money coming into the organization, management failing to catch errors in how it was accounting for money and failing to document how it picked vendors — including the general contractor for a Homekey housing project.

The Weingart Shelby purchase

Weingart Center has been the focus of recent controversy over its use of $27 million in taxpayer funds to buy a senior housing complex from an investor who had just purchased it for less than half that price.

As Weingart Center’s leader, Murray signed key documents in the purchase of the property on Shelby Drive in Cheviot Hills, according to contract records produced by the city in response to LAist public records requests. The documents he signed include a purchase agreement in which he agreed to have Weingart Center keep the seller’s name confidential forever from the news media and general public, with narrow exceptions.

That purchase now is the focus of a federal investigation and was referenced in an October indictment of the man who sold the property to Weingart Center. It was funded by the state’s Homekey program and the city of L.A.

Murray previously told the L.A. Times he had “no prior relationship with the seller and no continuing relationship” and that taxpayers paid fair market price. He has not returned LAist’s messages seeking comment on the property deal.

LAist also has been investigating the sale of the Shelby property and found numerous discrepancies. They include an appraisal report Murray commissioned and submitted for taxpayer funding that showed false information about the purchase deal and the property’s ownership.

Price concerns about another Murray-led project under same state grant program

The Shelby purchase is not the only Weingart Center property deal that has faced scrutiny.

This summer, city leaders in Torrance publicly alleged the group may have been massively overpaying for a hotel property under a new round of taxpayer-funded Homekey grants. For that site, Weingart Center had teamed up with L.A. County to apply for the grant.

It was one of several criticisms Torrance officials cited in urging the county not to proceed. Ultimately, the project was canceled.

Records show Murray had signed a purchase agreement for Weingart Center to buy the Torrance hotel for $30 million in taxpayer funds. An appraisal he later commissioned found its fair market value was close to the amount he agreed to.

But an appraisal commissioned by Torrance estimated it was worth just $10 million — a third of what Weingart had agreed to pay with taxpayer dollars.

Property valuations are being reviewed by the outside law firm hired by Weingart Center’s board, according to the nonprofit’s spokesperson.

Officials at the county government’s housing agency, known as LACDA, say the appraisal Weingart Center submitted for the Torrance purchase “was conducted by a reputable appraisal company and did not raise concerns.”

Torrance officials, meanwhile, said they had “serious concerns” about how much taxpayers would be paying.

City leaders sent a letter urging the state to reject the grant application.

“SNAP benefits ensure Washingtonians, including seniors, children, and people living with disabilities, have enough to eat every day,” Brown said.
The attorneys general argue that USDA’s memo illegally rewrites those rules and threatens to cut off food assistance for people who are fully eligible under the law.
The attorneys general argue that USDA’s guidance also misapplies the agency’s own regulations.
The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate the unlawful guidance and block its implementation to ensure that families do not lose critical food assistance.","Washington Attorney General Nick Brown today joined 21 other attorneys general in filing a lawsuit to stop the federal government from unlawfully cutting off Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for thousands of lawful permanent residents. Brown and the coalition are seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that wrongly treats several groups of legal immigrants as ineligible for food assistance, including permanent residents who were granted asylum or admitted as refugees. The attorneys general argue that the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose massive financial penalties on states, and are asking the court to declare the guidance unlawful.

“SNAP benefits ensure Washingtonians, including seniors, children, and people living with disabilities, have enough to eat every day,” Brown said. “Now, without any warning or legal basis, USDA is trying to rip these benefits away from green card holders in our communities. We will fight this illegal move and protect SNAP for Washingtonians.”

On October 31, USDA issued new guidance to state SNAP agencies describing changes to program eligibility under H.R. 1 or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which narrowed eligibility for certain non-citizen groups, including refugees, asylum recipients, and others admitted under humanitarian protection programs. The USDA memo, however, incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through these humanitarian pathways would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents.

Federal statutes make clear that refugees, asylees, humanitarian parolees, individuals whose deportation has been withheld, and other vulnerable legal immigrants become eligible for SNAP once they obtain their green cards and meet standard program requirements. The attorneys general argue that USDA’s memo illegally rewrites those rules and threatens to cut off food assistance for people who are fully eligible under the law.

The attorneys general argue that USDA’s guidance also misapplies the agency’s own regulations. Federal rules give states a 120-day grace period after new guidance is issued to adjust their systems without facing severe financial penalties. USDA is now claiming that this period expired on November 1, just one day after the guidance was released and before states even had a single business day to review it. The coalition argues that this interpretation is impossible under USDA’s own regulations, which state that the 120-day period cannot begin until new guidance is actually issued. And because the statute also imposes a cost-shifting framework on the SNAP program for states that USDA determines have unacceptable error rates in administering the program, by disregarding its own rules, USDA is exposing states to major financial penalties for errors caused by the agency’s late and inaccurate memo.

States have already begun implementing the statutory changes enacted earlier this year, but USDA’s abrupt and incorrect guidance now forces them to overhaul eligibility systems overnight. The attorneys general warn that this will create widespread confusion for families, increase the risk of wrongful benefit terminations, erode public trust, and place states in an untenable situation where they must either violate federal law or accept severe financial liability. The attorneys general are asking the court to vacate the unlawful guidance and block its implementation to ensure that families do not lose critical food assistance.

Joining Brown in this lawsuit, which was led by the attorneys general of New York and Oregon, are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

The president filed suit against Clinton, the DNC, Comey and 25 others more than three years ago, alleging they conspired to undermine his 2016 presidential campaign by accusing it of colluding with Russia.

However, District Judge Donald Middlebrooks, an appointee of former President Clinton, ruled in January 2023 that Trump’s case “should never have been brought” and ordered the president and Habba, then his personal attorney, to pay nearly $1 million in legal fees to the defendants.

Pryor, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, wrote Wednesday that the president and Habba “give us no reason to reverse the district court’s ruling that these claims were frivolous.” Pryor’s ruling was co-signed by Circuit Judges Andrew Brasher, a Trump appointee, and Embry Kidd, an appointee of former President Biden.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, who arrived from Brazil as a young child in 1998 with her parents, was taken into custody in Revere, Mass., and is accused by the Department of Homeland Security of overstaying her tourist visa.

Ferreira, 33, shares an 11-year-old son with Leavitt’s older brother, Michael, and the two share joint custody of the child, Ferreira’s attorney, Todd Pomerleau told USA TODAY. The couple was engaged about 12 years ago -and eventually broke up.

A DHS spokesperson described Ferreira as a ""criminal illegal alien"" with a ""previous arrest for battery"" without providing details.

Pomerleau said Ferreira, who is being held at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana, was in the final stages of getting her green card, with the last interview scheduled for the spring.

“She didn't commit a crime. She wasn't breaking the law. She was following the laws Congress created for her to get a green card, and she got detained with no justification,” said Pomerleau. “That's illegal.”

Ferriera, whom Pomerleau described as a highly involved mother who spent multiple days with her son every week, said she was on her way in the afternoon to pick her son up from school in southern New Hampshire, which is about 35 minutes from where she lives.

“She drove away from her home, and then she was pulled over, and she thought it was a traffic stop. She was apparently asked who she was and then she was arrested,” said Pomerleau. “I'm just worried about her getting out in time for Thanksgiving, which I don't think is happening unless she gets a Thanksgiving surprise.”

Pomerleau said Leavitt is “hopefully able to convince the president” to let her brother’s ex-fiancé “out of jail.”

Leavitt did not provide comments to USA TODAY but a source familiar with the dynamics between the two women said they haven't spoken to each other in years.

The source also said the that child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born, and that he had never resided with his mother.

Meanwhile, Ferreira’s sister Graziela DosSantos Rodrigues, has started a GoFundMe page to raise money for her sister's legal bills. The effort had raised more than $17,000 as of Nov. 26 at 10 a.m.

“Bruna’s absence has been especially painful for her 11-year-old son, Michael Leavitt Junior, who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she’ll be home in time for the holidays,"" says Rodrigues on the GoFundMe page.

The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has led to a record number of arrests. In less than a year, the number of people detained in ICE facilities is up by 50%, according to the American Immigration Council.

Currently, the Department of Homeland Security has jailed close to 60,000 people and ""the administration’s push for mass detentions and deportations has led to overcrowding as most facilities now exceed their contractualcapacity,"" according to the AIC.

Ferriera was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipient under the Obama administration, which allowed young, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to live and work legally. After the first Trump administration sought to terminate it, legal challenges have made the process long-winding.

So Ferriera, who owns and operates a cleaning service business and online clothing, decided to pursue the green card path, her lawyer said.

“She has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,"" wrote Rodrigues, her sister, on her GoFundMe page. ""She has maintained her legal status through DACA, followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing. There's no rhyme or reason to what's happening here.""

The group is taking aim at e-commerce behemoth Amazon and its grocery subsidiary, Whole Foods; tech giants Dell and Microsoft; Home Depot; streaming platform Spotify; and retail chain Target. The boycott webpage explains the reason each is listed, actions shoppers should take, and the campaign’s demands. In some cases, it also offers alternative companies.

Target is under fire for its “broad range of cooperation with the Trump administration’s racist policies.” The campaign is calling on the company to not only publicly commit to refusing collaboration with ICE but also immediately reinstate its scrapped diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads — a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.

The campaign site calls out Home Depot because it has “repeatedly allowed ICE agents to patrol and detain workers and customers in its parking lots and stores, usually without presenting judicial warrants or establishing probable cause,” and demands an end to those practices.

The group is urging Microsoft to end its “$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data.” The Dell section highlights that it has provided $18.8 million to “support the office of ICE’s chief information officer through the purchase of Microsoft enterprise software licenses,” and similarly calls for terminating that contract with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Amazon section states:

REASON: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the digital backbone of ICE’s machinery, selling the cloud power that helps track, target, and tear families apart.

ACTION: Stop shopping on Amazon where possible; cancel Prime subscriptions if feasible; push universities, unions, nonprofits, and campaigns to move off AWS when and where feasible, and to issue statements condemning Amazon’s role in corporate-sponsored mass deportations.

DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.

ALTERNATIVES: Bookshop.org and local bookstores; direct-from-brand purchasing; cooperatives; independent retailers.

The site also stresses that “every dollar spent at Whole Foods directly strengthens Amazon, whose AWS platform is the digital backbone of ICE’s machinery, powering the tools used to track, target, and tear families apart.”

While the campaign is beginning just before Black Friday, boycott organizers aim to ensure it will “not disappear” after this week.

“Unlike other consumer boycotts, Not With My Dollars is designed for long-term pressure and escalation,” Beyond the Ballot said. “To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company. Anything less is not accountability, just more corporate PR.”

“If you bankroll a violent, unaccountable agency that terrorizes our communities, you will not do it with our money,” the group added. “Across the country, poor and working-class migrant families are facing a wave of state-sponsored abductions, violence, and political policing under the fascist Trump administration. Corporations that choose to partner with, advertise on, bankroll, or provide critical infrastructure to ICE are not neutral; they are complicit.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1168248878-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 14:56:40.457479

While a sizable part of the People’s House was reduced to rubble, the Trump administration also took a wrecking ball to another fundamental part of our democracy: the people’s ownership of governance.

In a dry, technical memo, an obscure agency, deep in the seat of federal power, declared the end of public input into the most disputed, controversial and consequential federal rules.

Our right to breathe clean air, to be treated fairly and transparently when we buy a home or take out a car loan, and to be free from discrimination at school or in the workplace is now based entirely on the caprice of a deep-state bureaucrat.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) — which acts as the president’s drum major across the federal government, setting standards and enforcing discipline — issued this blueprint for the destruction of protections, rights and freedoms.

OMB told agencies that so long as they could make a case that the rule was illegal, whether or not a court had weighed in, they could roll back any rule. It told agencies to cut the public out, to not consult with state or local governments and to downplay the costs of a rule’s rollback.

For an administration that claims to be the people’s champion against an out-of-control deep state bureaucracy, this was deeply cynical.

Federal rules touch nearly everything: whether your child’s school is accessible, whether your doctor’s office has the right equipment, whether your information stays private online.

For decades, agencies have, as required by law, given the public, individuals and businesses, states, tribes and local governments, a chance to comment on and meet with the agency to discuss proposed rules. Only after the agency has reviewed all that information and considered the impact of the proposed rule can it go into effect.

Now, by administrative fiat, OMB has told agencies to dispense with gathering information altogether. The new directive largely permits agencies to demolish any rule without a public process.

We have spent much of our careers making sure that federal rules take into account the perspectives and experiences of ordinary people.

When a team working under one of us developed major rules at the Department of Justice — like the ones making websites accessible or ensuring that diagnostic equipment works for all bodies — they didn’t do it alone. They considered comments from people who knew what it was like to be locked out of a website or to not be weighed when they went to the doctor.

When the other helped shape rules governing the mortgage market at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, people who had lost their home to foreclosure as well as bankers, investors and lawyers were heard during the process.

Good rulemaking is done out in the open. It requires a conversation between the governed and the governing, subject to scrutiny and oversight.

An open rulemaking process isn’t symbolic. It forces agencies to consider opposing views. It limits agency overreach. And it invites scrutiny from courts, watchdogs and the public. Without public engagement, we risk regulating without rigor, repealing without reason and governing without accountability.

(AP) — The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Nov. 25 ordered a pair of three-judge panels to hear two lawsuits that argue the battleground state’s congressional maps must be redrawn because they unconstitutionally favor Republicans.

The court’s minority conservative justices blasted the creation of the three-judge panels as unimaginable political maneuvering designed to benefit Democrats. It’s unclear whether new districts could be ordered in time for the 2026 midterms as some Democrats want.

The court battle in Wisconsin is playing out amid a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump is trying to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in the 2026 elections.

Both of the pending redistricting cases in Wisconsin argue that the state’s congressional maps, first adopted in 2011, are an unconstitutional gerrymander favoring Republicans. Six of the state’s eight districts are currently held by Republicans.

Law firms that brought the pending cases in Wisconsin had argued over objections from Republicans that the cases should be heard by three-judge panels as required under a 2011 law passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican. Any decisions of those panels can be appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

The court’s rulings to proceed with the three-judge panels were 5-2, with conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn agreeing with liberal justices that the panels were appropriate. But Hagedorn objected to the court assigning the judges to hear the cases, saying a more neutral process should have been used.

“I am not suggesting the judicial panel will fail to do its job with integrity and impartiality,” Hagedorn wrote. “But this approach is an odd choice in the face of a statute so clearly designed to deter litigants from selecting their preferred venue and judge.”

One case will be heard by judges from Dane, Portage and Marathon counties. All three of the judges endorsed Justice Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court race, and two of them were appointed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

The other case will be heard by judges from Dane, Milwaukee and Outagamie counties. Two of the judges endorsed the liberal Crawford in 2025 and the third was appointed by Evers.

The two dissenting conservative justices blasted the court’s ruling creating the panels.

“Hand picking circuit court judges to perform political maneuvering is unimaginable,” Justice Annette Ziegler wrote. “Yet, my colleagues persist and appear to do this, all in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.”

The Supreme Court did not address the underlying arguments of the lawsuit, only the procedural question of whether the cases should first be heard by three-judge panels.

The lawsuits argue that the state’s current congressional district boundary lines are unconstitutional and need to be redrawn. One case was brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders and the other was filed on behalf of voters by the liberal Elias Law Group.

Abha Khanna, a partner with Elias Law Group, said the ruling was a “positive development” in the fight for new maps before the 2026 midterms.

Doug Poland, an attorney with Law Forward which represents the business group, said he looked forward to “delivering competitive congressional maps for the voters of Wisconsin,” but didn’t give a timeframe.

Wisconsin’s six Republican members of Congress also argued that two of the four liberal Wisconsin Supreme Court justices who accepted millions of dollars in campaign donations from the state Democratic Party should not participate in the cases. But both Crawford and Justice Janet Protasiewicz declined to step aside.

Republicans hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats, but only two of those districts are considered competitive. In 2010, the year before Republicans redrew the congressional maps, Democrats held five seats compared with three for Republicans.

The current congressional maps, which were based on the previous ones, were approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservative judges. The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.

Democrats are pushing to have the current maps redrawn in ways that would put two of the six seats currently held by Republicans into play. One they hope to flip is the western Wisconsin seat of Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who won in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired. Van Orden won reelection in the 3rd District in 2024.

The other seat they are eyeing is southeastern Wisconsin’s 1st District, held by Republican Rep. Bryan Steil since 2019. The latest maps made that district more competitive while still favoring Republicans.",https://wisconsinpublictv.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/courts-scowi-elections-redistricting-panels-20220711.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 11:58:30.426855

The operative ingredients are now in place for President DONALD TRUMP, should he choose, to strike land targets in Venezuela. But that window of opportunity — or at least the best chance of a strike pushing Venezuelan leader NICOLÁS MADURO to step down — may not last.

The administration’s decision to designate Cartel de los Soles a foreign terrorist group on Monday offers some semblance of legal justification for the military to conduct land-based strikes. (The U.S. accuses Maduro of leading the criminal network tied to Venezuelan elites.) There are also plenty of military assets — from ships to jets to U.S. servicemembers — now nearby to carry out strikes and rattle the Venezuelan powerbrokers surrounding Maduro.

It also doesn’t hurt that it’s a crescent moon for the next few days, enhancing the stealth capabilities of U.S. forces. Lower light works in the favor of nighttime attacks and the moon’s expansion may scramble plans.

Per JAMES STORY, who served as U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and head of the Venezuelan Affairs Unit at the U.S. embassy in Colombia during the first Trump and Biden administrations, said opting not to strike would at this point boost Maduro’s standing and make it much harder to dislodge him in the future.

“It certainly will strengthen his hand,” Story told NatSec Daily. “He will have been seen as staring down the U.S. government and winning.” Maduro is likely to be emboldened while the opposition will be demoralized and fractured, he added.

That said, it’s not clear the U.S. president wants to use military force against Venezuela at this moment. Axios reported Monday night that Trump wants to speak directly with Maduro, prompting some analysts to speculate Trump may ultimately cut a deal with Venezuela. (Story and others see it as a potential opportunity for Trump to issue an ultimatum to Maduro instead.)

And there’s plenty of reason for the president not to strike. Striking Venezuela would represent a major break in how the U.S. typically deals with hostile nations, especially those that haven’t previously directly attacked the U.S. or its servicemembers. It’s also far from guaranteed that strikes will result in Maduro ceding power — regardless of whether they come sooner or later. And it’s unclear what the day after would look like.

And successive polls show that Americans, broadly speaking, oppose U.S. strikes on Venezuela and any effort by the U.S. to directly provoke regime change in the South American petrostate. That includes plenty of people in the MAGA movement, who are skeptical of U.S. military adventurism around the world in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

Nevertheless, a sense of anticipation is growing among Cuban and Venezuelan exiles in south Florida, where your host finds himself spending the holiday with family. Popular livestreams in Miami and Doral are tracking the movements of U.S. military jets in the region. Many Cubans and Venezuelans who have backed Secretary of State MARCO RUBIO throughout his political career are expressing their optimism that Trump and the nation’s top diplomat will oust a leader they decry as an autocrat.

“Maduro is not a brave boy,” said Rep. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR (R-Fla.), who represents Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood in Congress, in a Fox Business interview. “He’s understanding we’re about to go in.”

The Inbox

PEACE, NO MATTER WHAT: While Ukrainian officials and European allies scrambled to navigate the chaotic negotiations over the U.S.-backed peace plan that unfolded over the past week, Trump had only one goal in mind: end the war, no matter the details.

Ukrainians and Europeans had balked at the original 28-point peace plan, arguing that the proposal, which would have handed Russia swathes of Ukrainian territory, outlined a better deal for Moscow than Kyiv. But Trump has no such red lines, White House officials told our own Diana Nerozzi in a story out today.

“The ultimate goal is peace. That’s the most important thing that can be achieved here. Stop the fighting, stop the killing. Those are the main things he wants out of this,” a senior White House official told Diana. That underlying drive explains the administration’s oftentimes haphazard approach to negotiations — which one day appeared to be led by Army Secretary DAN DRISCOLL, and the next by Rubio.

Driscoll is back at the helm today, leading negotiations with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on a revised peace proposal that emerged from the weekend’s haggling between U.S. and Ukrainian delegations in Geneva, our own Paul McLeary reports. The new plan omits any reference to territorial issues, leaving those up for discussion at the presidential level somewhere down the line.

Meanwhile, Trump said in a social media post today that he’d directed special envoy STEVE WITKOFF to meet with Russian leader VLADIMIR PUTIN in Moscow “in the hopes of finalizing this peace plan.”

DARING DRONES: Drone incursions into NATO are getting deeper — and bolder.

Romanian officials said NATO scrambled fighter jets today in response to the deepest drone incursion in Romanian airspace yet, and the first breach that took place in broad daylight rather than the cover of night, Reuters reports. Today’s incursion was the 13th such violation Romania has reported since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022.

German jets initially took off to track an aircraft that had crossed into the country’s southeastern county of Tulcea before eventually heading back into Ukraine, according to the Romanian defense ministry. Later, the Romanian army scrambled two of its F-16 fighter jets and an additional two Eurofighters to track a drone in the neighboring county of Galati.

Romanian Defense Minister IONUT MOSTEANU called the breach a “Russian provocation,” adding that he believed the NATO pilots decided not to shoot down the latter drone over concerns that it might cause damage on the ground. The drone ultimately appeared to have crashed on its own, Mosteanu said.

Gen. CHRISTOPHER DONAHUE, commander of U.S. Army Europe and Africa, said during a visit to U.S. troops at Romania’s MIHAIL KOGALNICEANU air base today that a new capability to shoot down drones had been tested and was in the “final stages of being employed” in the country.

TRUMP-TAKAICHI CALL MYSTERY: Trump spoke today with Japanese Prime Minister SANAE TAKAICHI. Tokyo’s readout of the call suggested that China — whose leader XI JINPING Trump spoke with Monday — was a key topic. Trump briefed Takaichi “on the latest situation of U.S.-China relations,” according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

The White House hasn’t published a summary of the call and didn’t respond to NatSec Daily’s requests for a readout of the two leaders’ discussion.

Beijing has been on an aggressive campaign against Takaichi, including economic reprisals, for saying earlier this month that Chinese aggression against Taiwan would likely spark a Japanese military response. U.S. Ambassador to Japan GEORGE GLASS has sparred with Chinese propagandists seeking to demonize Takaichi.

“Coercion is a hard habit to break for Beijing. But just as the United States stood by Japan during China’s last unwarranted ban on Japanese seafood, we will be there for our ally again this time,” Glass posted on X last week.

But Trump himself has been silent on Beijing’s attacks on Takaichi, puzzling Japan watchers.

“The Japanese view is that this is not good enough — with their leader’s reputation and political standing on the line, they would like a leader-level statement for a leader-level problem,” said KURT TONG, deputy chief of mission and chargé d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo from 2011 to 2014.

NatSec Daily asked the White House why Trump hasn’t spoken on the issue, but didn’t hear back.

Democrats sense political capital in the absence of White House pushback against Beijing’s anti-Takaichi rhetoric. “President Trump has refused to push back against Chinese intimidation,” said Rep. JOAQUIN CASTRO (D-Texas), co-chair of the U.S.-Japan Congressional Caucus. “The president is desperately seeking a meeting with Xi Jinping and abandoning Japan, our closest ally in Asia.”

Keystrokes

PLANKEY POPULARITY: A collection of powerful technology and cybersecurity trade groups is pushing for the Senate to confirm Trump’s pick to direct the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as his nomination faces resistance in the upper chamber.

The Information Technology Industry Council, Alliance for Digital Innovation, Center for Procurement Advocacy and the Cybersecurity Coalition penned a letter to Senate leadership, shared exclusively with our own Dana Nickel in today’s Morning Cybersecurity (for Pros!). In the missive, the groups write that SEAN PLANKEY’s confirmation must go through to restore “needed leadership” at CISA.

Not only is Plankey “prepared to meet [the] challenge” of heading up the cyber agency, but continuing to delay filling the role “runs counter to the national security interests of the United States,” the groups write.

But the show of support from industry groups isn’t likely to tip the scale in Plankey’s favor. Trump’s pick to lead CISA is facing stiff resistance from Senate Republicans, some of whom are withholding support for Plankey while others are more broadly apathetic when it comes to the cyber agency in general.

Our own John Sakellariadis reported last week (also for Pros!) that cybersecurity officials are increasingly worried that Plankey won’t be confirmed by the end of this year, meaning the White House would have to resubmit his nomination in 2026. Further delays could make operations even more difficult at CISA, which has already faced significant turmoil with massive staffing cuts.

The trade groups sent the letter to Majority Leader JOHN THUNE, Minority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER, and chair and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) and GARY PETERS (D-Mich.). None of the senators responded to Morning Cyber’s request for comment on the letter.

The Complex

SIGN OF LIFE: The Trump administration’s Golden Dome missile defense project is gearing up again after prolonged delays caused by the government shutdown and a lack of clarity on plans for the project, our colleagues at Morning Defense report today (for Pros!).

The Space Force is set to issue requests for proposals from companies on space-based interceptors for the defense shield on Dec. 7, according to a new notice. The interceptors can destroy missiles in the midcourse phase of flight, after the missile’s booster burns out. According to experts, that’s the best time to halt missiles from space, our colleagues write.

The notice added that the Defense Department could use “prize competitions” for the award, meaning companies would invest in building prototypes to compete for prize amounts in hopes that they could eventually win a production contract.

On the Hill

UNDER INVESTIGATION: The Trump administration appears to be escalating its campaign against the six Democratic lawmakers who released a video encouraging troops to resist illegal orders, our own Nicholas Wu reports.

In a joint statement today, Democratic Reps. JASON CROW (Colo.) and MAGGIE GOODLANDER (N.H.), alongside CHRIS DELUZIO and CHRISSY HOULAHAN of Pennsylvania said the FBI had put in a request with the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms for interviews with the lawmakers. The lawmakers bashed Trump for “using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress,” adding that “we will not be bullied” into submission.

In a separate post, Sen. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-Mich.) wrote that the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division “appeared to open an inquiry” into her over her participation in the video. “The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,” Slotkin wrote.

The Pentagon announced Monday that it is investigating Navy veteran and Arizona Sen. MARK KELLY, another Democrat featured in the video, for “serious allegations of misconduct.” Trump has railed against the group of six lawmakers, claiming their video amounted to “sedition” and could be punishable by death.

The Senate and House Sergeants at Arms offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the FBI.

Broadsides

DOUBTING DONALD: Trump has claimed that he can end the war in Ukraine. Brits aren’t so sure.

Think tank More in Common shared with our colleagues at London Playbook today their findings that 47 percent of British voters think Trump is an obstacle to stopping the war. Twenty-one percent said they thought he gave peacemaking efforts a boost, while just over 21 percent said he was neither helpful nor harmful. Eleven percent said they didn’t know.

The poll surveyed 2,062 British adults between Nov. 22-24, while U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks on a peace agreement in Geneva. The margin of error for the poll was 2.2 percentage points.

A broad coalition of groups from across Canada is sounding an urgent alarm in advance of a critical parliamentary vote on Bill C-12.

The bill would open the door to discrimination and violations of human rights and due process in Canada’s immigration system, authorize sharing of sensitive personal immigration information, and expand dangerous approaches to drug policy. Yet it is being pushed through parliament with minimal debate while those that will be impacted by its sweeping changes are locked out of the process.

“This deeply concerning and highly controversial legislation will put many refugees in danger, risking their return to persecution in violation of rights protected under the Charter and international law,” said Gauri Sreenivasan, Co-Executive Director of the Canadian Council of Refugees. “And yet the bill is moving at break neck speed through Parliament while those with expertise and lived experience who want to advise on its dangers are shut out of the process. Neither the law nor the public interest is being served.”

The bill will deny many refugees access to fair and independent assessment and full appeal of their claims by the Immigration and Refugee Board because of arbitrary time limits and exclusions. This approach will not streamline Canada’s processing of refugee claims, but will lead to lower quality decisions while shifting backlogs to our already overburdened Federal Courts and to IRCC.

The bill will also compound harm arising from the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement, which abandons many refugees to the U.S. immigration system at a time when well documented human rights violations have become the dominant feature of that system.

”Bill C-12 would deny protection to vulnerable people irrespective of changes to their personal circumstances or political conditions back home. So many people like me, who sought safety here and have made lives here, would be shut out by this Bill. This isn’t just policy, it’s people’s lives,” said Tonny Muzira, Co-Founder & Director of Advocacy and Partnerships Centre for Black Development Options Canada. “Canada cannot turn its back on those seeking safety.”

Under Bill C-12, the government will also be able to cancel or suspend immigration documents and applications based on an undefined assessment of the “public interest”. This power grants dangerous discretionary power to the government without any individualized assessment or procedural safeguards.

“The bill sets up open-ended powers with little thought to the consequences and inevitable abuse”, said Louis-Philippe Jannard, of the Table de concertation des organismes au service des personnes réfugiées et immigrantes (TCRI). “We haven’t seen such broad, discretionary powers in our immigration system since the 1970’s, when their abuse led to rampant discrimination and fatal decisions.”

Bill C-12 would also authorize the government to share highly sensitive immigration information with few limitations. This includes changes in gender identity and the status of any refugee claimants, exposing vulnerable people in Canada to severe risk.

“Broad dissemination of sensitive personal information can place migrants and refugees at significant risk of discrimination and persecution in Canada and abroad”, said Tamir Israel, Director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s Privacy, Surveillance and Technology Program. “Despite this significant potential for abuse, Bill C-12 lacks minimum safeguards like the need to ensure information sharing is necessary and proportionate.”

Bill C-12 also doubles down on prohibition-based drug policy that has demonstrably failed to protect public health and safety.

“Instead of funding affordable housing and other health and social supports, Canada is supporting U.S.-led militarized drug enforcement,” said Nick Boyce, from the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition. “If Canada follows this path, it will be complicit in violations of international human rights law.”

In disregard of the dire risks posed by this legislative proposal, the bill has been fast-tracked and received minimal consideration in Parliament. It is scheduled for a final vote by the Standing Committee on Public Safety tomorrow—just three weeks after its study of the bill began.

Despite the highly attenuated timeline, dozens of refugee and migrant groups, human rights groups, labour organizations, health advocacy groups, representatives of the Black community, gender based violence groups, legal professional bodies, drug policy groups and others requested to speak at committee hearings but were denied. They have also submitted briefs expressing concern regarding Bill C-12’s consequences.

These groups were largely absent from committee proceedings and MPs will not have the time to consider the long list of concerns raised by these submissions. In contrast, MPs heard repeatedly from border and policing agencies and officials. The end result is that the voices of those most impacted by Bill C-12 have not been heard.

“MPs and the public should be extremely concerned that the government is fast-tracking legislation that will only multiply the possibility of discrimination, exploitation, and violations of human rights,” said Karen Cocq of the Migrant Rights Network. “ This government got elected promising to reject Trump-style politics, but Bill C-12 is the opposite of that. This bill cannot be fixed, it must be withdrawn.”",https://www.fcjrefugeecentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Our-organization-ft.png,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:27.764293

The group, made up of veterans of the military and the C.I.A., said the bureau had contacted the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms requesting interviews with them, though it is unclear what, if any, laws they might conceivably have violated with their video.

“President Trump is using the F.B.I. as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress,” the four House members, all military veterans, who took part in the video said in a joint statement. “No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution.”

The investigation is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration to seek retribution against the president’s perceived political enemies. It comes one day after the Pentagon said it was investigating Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, for his participation in the same video.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a letter addressed to the Department of the Navy, requested a briefing on the status of the inquiry into Mr. Kelly by Dec. 10.

The F.B.I. inquiry into the six lawmakers is being conducted by the bureau’s counterterrorism division, according to a statement by Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who served as a C.I.A. analyst and organized the video.

“The president directing the F.B.I. to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,” she wrote in the statement. “He believes in weaponizing the federal government against his perceived enemies and does not believe laws apply to him or his cabinet.”

The four House members who took part in the video are Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania.

The F.B.I. declined to comment on whether it was investigating the lawmakers.

Mr. Kelly is the only member of the group being investigated by the Pentagon for a possible court martial. As a retired naval officer, he is subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and could be recalled to active duty and disciplined. The other four military veterans did not serve long enough to retire and therefore do not receive a pension or fall under military law.

Legal experts have dismissed the investigations as a transparent attempt to seek vengeance with no grounding in the law. As part of their training, U.S. troops are told that they are obligated to refuse illegal orders from their chain of command.

The lawmakers did not refer to a particular order that they viewed as illegal. But Mr. Kelly and others in the video earlier raised concerns about the fate of U.S. troops involved in the Trump administration’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean.

Some, including Ms. Slotkin, have expressed concerns that Mr. Trump might deploy active-duty U.S. military troops to American cities to crack down on or even shoot at protesters.

This summer, Ms. Slotkin reminded Mr. Hegseth that one of his predecessors, Mark T. Esper, wrote in his memoir that he had been asked by Mr. Trump during his first term why the military could not “just shoot” protesters in Washington in the legs.

Mr. Hegseth on Tuesday appeared to be focused on other matters, such as a picture that Mr. Kelly had posted on social media of his military awards.

“In combat, I had a missile blow up next to my jet and flew through anti-aircraft fire to drop bombs on enemy targets,” Mr. Kelly wrote above the photo.

Mr. Hegseth replied a day later: “Your medals are out of order & rows reversed. When/if you are recalled to active duty, it’ll start with a uniform inspection.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/25/multimedia/25dc-fbi-video-bjgw/25dc-fbi-video-bjgw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:21.832940

November 26, 2025

The United Kingdom has experienced another summer of anti-immigration protests and riots, which have continued into the fall. This escalation has led to an increase in racist attacks across the UK. For example, in York, “two Muslim men were attacked with tennis rackets and sticks and subjected to racist abuse” by a “group of 15 balaclava-clad youths on mountain bikes” (BBC, 2025). This is just one of several hate crime incidents that happened in June. This past August, two Sikh cab drivers were attacked in Wolverhampton, leaving one man with broken ribs and the second man needing hospital treatment for bruising (Fofana, 2025).

In Bristol, a nine-year-old girl was shot with an airgun and subjected to racial slurs. The police are treating this attack as racially motivated. The Avon and Somerset Police have noted the increase in race-related hate incidents in recent years. For example, “in 2024, a total of 3,774 incidents were recorded, compared to 3,150 the previous year and 2,743 in 2022. So far this year, 2,563 such incidents have been logged” (Yhnell and De La Mare, 2025). The rise in racially motivated attacks has made migrants and minority communities, including UK citizens, feel increasingly anxious and concerned for their safety.

Across the UK, there have been demonstrations and counter-protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers (Yhnell and De La Mare, 2025). In September, a protester in the Scottish city of Falkirk threw a brick through the window of the Cladhan Hotel after weeks of tense demonstrations. It was discovered that one of the asylum seekers housed there was jailed in June for raping a 15-year-old girl in 2023 (Briggs, 2025). Anti-migrant protests have persisted in other cities, including Bristol, Birmingham, Aberdeen, Dundee, and Perth, with demonstrators claiming that asylum seekers pose a threat to women’s safety.

Claims from these protestors that they are protecting women and children have been met with criticism from the End Violence Against Women Coalition. The coalition of 200 organizations across the UK have united to warn against “the weaponisation of violence against women and girls by far-right groups and mainstream politicians to further a racist, anti-migrant agenda” (End Violence Against Women Coalition, 2025). In August, a signed letter from the coalition was sent to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling for urgent action against the weaponization of violence against women and girls and highlighting the false narratives about immigration that far-right groups and politicians are spreading.

Contrary to the protesters’ claims, violent incidents targeting women and girls reveal that the safety of women was never the true motive behind the anti-immigration demonstrations. For instance, in Dundee, three men filmed themselves abusing women who were providing free soup and sandwiches to asylum seekers in temporary accommodation. In a video shared with the Scottish news media website, The Ferret, men can be heard shouting “I’ll fucking assault you all…Go back to your own place you fucking cow” or “the police aren’t here to protect you now”(Briggs, 2025). In another incident this past September in the West Midlands, a Sikh woman reported that she was raped in a racially motivated attack. She claimed that the perpetrators told her, “You don’t belong in this country, get out” (Stavrou, 2025).

These violent incidents have continued to escalate. In early October, a car was driven into members of the public at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester. A member of the security team at the synagogue was stabbed by a suspected assailant, British citizen of Syrian descent, Jihad Al-Shamie, who was subsequently shot and killed by firearms officers (Wilkinson, Hag, Stockwell, and Regan, 2025). Two men were killed in the attack, and three other people were taken to the hospital with serious injuries. While most reported incidents seem to target migrants and British citizens of Asian or African descent, hate crimes motivated by race and ethnicity appear to be occurring against all minority groups across the UK. Notably, the accident at the synagogue was followed by right-leaning newspapers quoting in their headlines that the attacker was “an Islamic terrorist”, helping to fuel the Islamophobia and racism that is overtaking the country (Ali, 2025).

The increase in racial attacks and protests is connected to growing frustration with the UK government's handling of immigration, as well as a general disillusionment with political leaders and their ability to bring about positive change for citizens. Many people in Britain have faced challenges due to austerity, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Right-wing politicians and influencers have exploited this rising discontent to redirect that anger toward migrants.

Ex-convict and far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson, real name Stephan Yaxley-Lennon, was released from prison this year and has been active on social media, often spreading false narratives about migrant populations in the UK. He led a ""Unite the Kingdom"" protest this September in London, which drew between 110,000 and 150,000 people (Aljazeera, 2025). Some demonstrators rioted, confronting officers and engaging in physical and verbal abuse that resulted in 26 police officers being injured (Aljazeera, 2025). Robinson and his guest speakers, which included billionaire Elon Musk via video link, French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, and Petr Bystron of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party promoted the idea that British culture is being eroded. They also preached about the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims that white Europeans are being intentionally replaced by non-white immigrants (Aljazeera, 2025).

In addition to Robinson's influence, Nigel Farage and his Reform UK political party have gained popularity. Farage is a far-right politician who has been making extreme, outlandish and xenophobic comments for decades (Hope Not Hate, 2024). He has used his political standing to spread conspiracy theories and misformation about minorities and migrant populations. The wave of displeasure with the current government and Farage’s success in the last general election has given him more agency to spread false narratives that embolden disenfranchised citizens.

The rise of racist and xenophobic attacks and protests presents a challenging time in the UK’s history that is reminiscent of racial tension in the 1970s. Not only are migrant populations being attacked, but UK citizens from diverse ethnic populations are also being victimized. The growing racial tension, misinformation from far-right leaders, and the inadequate response from the current Labour government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have contributed to a sense that this movement is running unchecked (Elgot, Mason and Walker, 2025). Recent incidents of racism and xenophobia in the UK have violated both the European Convention on Human Rights and the UK's own hate crime laws. These actions pose serious risks to individuals, potentially resulting in harm or even death. As a consequence, communities are left terrified and increasingly divided.

Gary Younge, a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, noted that, “One thing that differentiates this moment from others before it, where racial tension intermingled with xenophobia, is the global aspect of it. The same talking points about ‘the great replacement’ of ‘Indigenous’ white people, and the perceived threat to women in Europe, particularly from Black men, are showing up on my social media feeds and in discourse in the US, Ireland, the UK and across Europe,” Younge says. “They’re all feeding off each other” – even when the situations in these countries are not analogous.” (Malik, 2025). However, Younge believes, “there is still resistance, and that’s an important thing to insist on” (Malik, 2025). Importantly, while political leaders may fall short in their efforts to end racist and xenophobic incidents and riots, ordinary people have stepped up to resist far-right groups, emphasizing the necessity of treating all individuals with respect and kindness, and this underscores the ability of everyday citizens to combat human rights violations.

Glossary

Anti-immigration - Anti-immigration is a political stance that opposes immigration and advocates for policies that restrict or reduce the number of immigrants that enter a country. Opposition can vary from supporting reforms that completely ban immigration to calls for the removal of immigrants. Reasoning behind these views often include concerns over economic impact, cultural integration, and national security.

Asylum Seekers - An asylum seeker is an individual who has left their home country in search of refuge in another country. People may flee their home country due to fear of persecution or significant human rights violations. An asylum seeker is not yet recognized as a refugee and is currently awaiting a decision on their asylum claim.

Cost-of-Living Crisis - The UK's cost of living crisis refers to a period of falling incomes since late 2021, driven by high inflation peaking in October 2022. The rise in inflation and the lack of wage increases have led to higher prices for food, energy, and rent. Factors that have contributed to the crisis include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and the war in Ukraine.

European Convention on Human Rights - The European Convention on Human Rights is a treaty created by the Council of Europe to protect fundamental civil and political rights and freedoms across its 47 member states. Since 1950, this treaty has established legal commitments and standards of behavior for member governments to uphold and protect. Importantly, the UK is still a member despite leaving the European Union in 2020.

Great Replacement -The Great Replacement is a far-right, white nationalist conspiracy theory that falsely claims white populations in Western countries are being intentionally and systematically replaced by non-white immigrants by government elites and global institutions.

Indigenous - Indigenous are people or items that are native or original to a particular place. When referring to people, it is often linked to the first-known inhabitants of a region with strong ancestral links to the land before colonization or the creation of current state boundaries.

Islamophobia - Islamophobia is fear, prejudice, hatred, and discrimination against Islam or Muslim people. It can manifest as hostile attitudes and actions including verbal or physical abuse, stereotyping, media misrepresentation, and discriminatory actions. Islamophobia is often fueled by racial biases.

Racial Slurs - A racial slur is language or behavior that is used with the intention to insult, degrade, or demean someone based on their race or ethnicity. Racial slurs often perpetuate harmful stereotypes and can be interpreted as racialharassment or discrimination.

Race-related hate incidents - A race-related hate incident is an act of prejudice motivated by bias against a person's actual or perceived race, color, nationality, or ethnic origin. A hate incident does not involve a violent crime, threats of violence, or property damage that would lead to a criminal prosecution. Incidents can be verbal, physical (non-assaultive), or visual.

Xenophobia - Xenophobia is the dislike, hatred or fear of someone from another country. It can manifest as hostility, discrimination or prejudice towards immigrants or members of another culture or religion.

Food waste did not start with the Trump administration.
This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.","The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.

The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.

Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it – rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.

This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.

As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.

Immigration policy

Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.

The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers – with lethal consequences at times.

Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.

News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”

Foreign aid cuts

When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.

Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.

An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.

Tariffs

In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.

And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.

Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.

Other efforts lead to more waste

Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.

In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.

Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.

The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.

Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need.

The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status.

On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students’ financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.

In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.

In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law.

As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.

To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.

Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable.

‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’

Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.

On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.

After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted.

In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding.

Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.

Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs.

Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma.

Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win

The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.

Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.

Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.

The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.

However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.

The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.

But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition.

All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can.

In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then.

“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.

Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.

What’s likely next

California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice.

Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.

Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.

A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.

The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said.

For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility.

In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.

College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.”

The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112823_DACA-Students_AE_CM_20.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:47.645468

Ferguson made this fragility clear in his letter: several Republican-led states aren’t redistricting because other Democratic states have stalled their efforts.","The unprecedented push to create new congressional districts mid-decade is hitting roadblocks in the form of local elected officials from both parties.

Republicans face headwinds in the 2026 midterms: the party in power often loses ground in the election after a presidential win, and Trump’s agenda isn’t going over well. The 2025 off-year elections showed voters favoring Democrats at higher-than-expected margins. Trump wants to keep the House in Republican control by redrawing congressional maps to create more Republican-friendly districts. He first pressured Texas, which responded by drawing five additional red districts, which led California to advance a now-approved ballot measure to create five more Democrat-friendly districts to offset Texas’s maps.

But the White House pressure campaigns haven’t found willing participants in all GOP-held statehouses, or from the courts. Texas’s maps were blocked by a federal court, and the US supreme court will review that decision, which could deal a blow to the whole gambit. Voters in Missouri are trying to stop their state’s gerrymander via a referendum.

The big mid-decade GOP gerrymander isn’t inevitable – but it isn’t over.

Some lawmakers, on the left and the right, are steeling themselves against the pressure. Some have philosophical opposition and believe in protecting the normal process, in which districts are drawn every 10 years after the census, and don’t want to wade into a nakedly partisan process and further undermine voters’ faith in democratic processes.

Others are doing their own math and realizing redistricting puts their own party at risk of a “dummymander”, or a district intended to help one party that unintentionally helps the opposition. There are legal calculations as well: new districts can invite lawsuits, and the supreme court decision could disrupt their plans.

Some statehouse leaders are protecting their members who would vote against redistricting efforts because they don’t want to subject their members to attacks or primaries. The bar to pass new maps is high in some states – the party needs near uniformity to clear it.

Mark Schreiber, a Republican representative in the Kansas House, said he doesn’t approve of redistricting for a political purpose. “I’m not just going to redistrict just to accommodate trying to increase chances for maintaining a majority in the US House,” he said.

Clarke Sanders, a Republican in the Kansas House, told the Guardian via email that redistricting “didn’t seem like a good idea to me” because the state just drew new districts three years ago. Kansas has four congressional districts, only one of which is held by a Democrat, Sharice Davids. Redrawing lines could risk the party losing not just in her district, but another district as well, he said.

“The problem is NOT the makeup of the district, the problem is, IMO, we don’t have a candidate,” Sanders said. “We could win in the district the way it is now with the right candidate.”

David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said the pushback is a “really positive development on both sides,” so long as it remains on both sides. Redistricting is historically rare, and the closer we get to an election, the more confusing it gets for voters and more difficult to implement for elections officials, he said.

“I’m impressed by the legislators who are thinking about the big picture and thinking about their voters rather than the possibility of gaining one more seat in a very closely divided House of Representatives,” Becker said.

Voters often disapprove of gerrymandering and see it as unfair. A recent YouGov survey found most in both parties opposed the idea when it was described. But a more recent Politico poll showed a majority in both parties wanted their parties to make more favorable districts, with the right wanting to keep power and the left seeking to push back against Trump.

It’s a distinction from the trend in many states, which have moved toward independent redistricting in which nonpartisan (or at least less partisan) committees help draw lines that better reflect their populaces.

“I don’t think anybody left of Maga wants to be here,” said John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “This is a crisis that was thrust upon the country by Donald Trump picking up the phone, calling Greg Abbott and trying to steal five congressional seats at a moment in time when we had found a reasonable balance.”

Resisting intense full-court press from the White House is difficult for a party allegiant to Trump. But some in Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska and New Hampshire have refused to give in.

Trump targeted the Indiana Senate on Tuesday, saying the state was going to take up redistricting in two weeks and he hoped the Senate would find the votes to pass new maps.

“If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but,” he wrote on Truth Social, “if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country.”

Some who haven’t publicly approved of redistricting in Indiana have had their homes swatted.

Rodric Bray, the Republican president pro tem of the Indiana Senate, is a key holdout. He said in a statement on 18 November that he wants to see a Republican majority in the US House, but he disagrees on how to achieve it. It makes more sense to focus on electing a Republican in the state’s first congressional district, which has trended right in recent cycles, rather than create new districts. Bray said this week the Senate would reconvene in December because redistricting “has received a lot of attention and is causing strife,” though it was unclear if his chamber had the votes to pass new maps.

On the left, states have largely operated in response to Republican efforts. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said his state is waiting to see what happens with Indiana.

“We’re watching what Indiana does,” Pritzker said earlier in November. “We may have to react to that. It’s certainly something that people have considered here, and the legislature has considered here. But we’ll have to see what happens.”

In Maryland, Senate president Bill Ferguson has opposed his state’s push to redistrict. He has seen intense scrutiny from his party for this position, especially as Democrats work to counter Trump’s grip on the federal government. “Meet the Most Hated Democrat in America,” a headline in the Bulwark said this month.

But others in his chamber agree. Cheryl Kagan, a Democratic senator, told Maryland Matters that there are many issues lawmakers should be focused on instead. “At some point, this feels like a risky distraction,” she said.

The holding pattern is fragile – if one state moves, others will likely follow suit, domino after domino. And Republican states have more of an opportunity to game the system: their legislative majorities oversee more Democratic seats than Democratic majorities do Republicans.

Ferguson made this fragility clear in his letter: several Republican-led states aren’t redistricting because other Democratic states have stalled their efforts. If Maryland moves forward, Republican states will, too. “That means that Maryland’s potential gain of one seat is immediately eliminated, and, in fact, worsens the national outlook,” he wrote.

It remains to be seen how many Republican state lawmakers will continue their stand against the Trump administration despite the threats of primaries or swatting attacks or bad blood with their fellow lawmakers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8967170dc4d4663ee9f9a6c85070100f9f81e790/232_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a2bdcd58644c64fa1b6db4981b528ee",N,,2025-11-26 08:58:32.478639

Reports of ICE arrests in some of those smaller cities have been trending over the past weeks, although the official numbers are tough to pinpoint. Some suburban communities are responding to immigration enforcement in different ways.

The Burien neighborhood where Juan spent time growing up is quiet.

It’s close to 6 p.m., a time when people are typically getting home from work. The block is a mix of apartment buildings and suburban homes — lots of minivans and work trucks.

The only things moving in the neighborhood are Juan and his daughter, as they make their way to his uncle’s place.

ICE arrested Juan's uncle in late October, on a freeway on-ramp while he was on his way to work early in the morning, around 5 a.m. Juan said his uncle’s arrest — and that of several others — sent a chill through the neighborhood.

Juan agreed to speak with KUOW on the condition that we don’t use his last name.

“There used to be more people around walking — especially Hispanic people,"" he said. ""Now, as you can see, it’s empty. It’s really empty and I don’t blame them. They get scared [that they'll] come out, there’s someone waiting outside.”

A day after his uncle's arrest, Juan said he was stopped by law enforcement on the freeway in the middle of the road. He describes four cars surrounding him, and slowing down to a stop on the freeway. He believes it was ICE. He suspects they followed him from his uncle's neighborhood and were waiting for him the next day.

“ICE agents blend in,"" he said. ""It’s hard to notice them all of a sudden until they start coming out of their vehicles.""

They let him go. Juan has DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

He's an adult with a family of his own now. But years ago, before he got DACA, he was a kid living in the U.S. without legal status, brought here by his family. DACA provided people like him with work visas and protection from being immediately deported.

As for his uncle, the government had ordered him to leave the country decades ago. ICE has said one of their priorities is to follow up on cases where someone remains in the U.S. after they've been ordered to leave. But his uncle also has a daughter who has U.S. citizenship, which could help him stay in the U.S.

Juan said his uncle was taken from a life he spent decades building with his wife. Since then, Juan’s aunt has been keeping closer tabs on the street activity outside. KUOW agreed to not name her because of her immigration status.

Juan’s aunt said in the months and days leading up to her husband's arrest, she saw unmarked vehicles with tinted windows driving around the neighborhood.

Even if they don’t know everyone personally, over the decades, Juan's aunt said they’ve been able to familiarize themselves with their neighbors' cars, and they know when someone isn’t from the neighborhood.

“All of a sudden, we see trucks with different license plates,"" she said in Spanish. ""Not all of them are from here, the majority are from other places.”

In the weeks after her husband's arrest, reports increased of immigration enforcement happening in the cities surrounding Seattle, slowly making their way into the city.

Photos, videos, and news reports show unidentified federal agents making arrests on roads and parking lots in cities as far north as Everett, edging into Seattle on Aurora Avenue, and seen on the Eastside, in Redmond. Local police have verified that some of these were ICE arrests.

It’s unclear if there’s been an actual uptick. ICE did not respond to questions about arrest numbers.

But some wonder if these latest arrests are because federal agents are using license plate readers to identify undocumented immigrants. A recent Associated Press report revealed that Border Patrol is using license plate readers, and often referring some cars to other law enforcement agencies to make stops.

Conversations about license plate data and immigration are happening in Issaquah, Redmond, Bellevue, Bothell, and Burien, among others. Some neighborhoods in those cities have prominent immigrant communities, with between a quarter to nearly half of the population made up of people who were born outside of the United States.

During city council meetings, some public comments have pushed for a ban or restriction on license plate readers, and for the passage of measures to protect immigrants.

Hugo Garcia, who’s starting his second term on the Burien City Council, said he's disappointed he hasn't been able to get more done to protect the immigrant community in his city.

He'd like to have more flexibility to enact measures like those he's seen in Seattle, like proposals to ban masked law enforcement and to use Seattle Police to verify if federal immigration officers are making a legal arrest.

""They're able to do sanctuary city ordinances or update the ordinances directly a little bit easier,"" he said, ""whereas, for cities like us and other cities that contract with the sheriffs, we're worried about the liability and cost.""

RELATED: Issaquah on edge after ICE arrest outside preschool

Garcia said there’s reluctance to pass similar measures in a smaller city and potentially risk the loss of federal funding.

“Folks are scared to take action, to poke the bear, and bring even more attention to the city. It's been very hard for me to accept that,"" he said. ""And what can I do? OK well, I can volunteer, I can share the phone number.”

Garcia is a volunteer with an ICE watch group. People call in to report ICE activity, and they send volunteers like him out to document arrests and connect people to legal services. He was one of the people who went to Juan’s family in Burien after his uncle's arrest.

Juan, his cousins, and siblings — all of different immigration statuses — have started their own neighborhood watch. They’ll drive around and text each other updates. It takes a little extra time out of his day, but Juan feels it's worth it.

“I think about the people — older ladies, moms taking their kids, older dads trying to go to work —they've got to pay rent one way or another,"" Juan said. ""If I can put a little of my effort to do that, I will continue doing it.”",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/73b559404fa1f396b6a45c194efb8048?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-11-26 10:59:38.007211

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Trump said yesterday that “the original 28-Point Peace Plan…has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement,” adding that he will “ONLY” meet Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin “when the deal to end the War is FINAL or, in its final stages.” Trump announced that United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff will meet with Putin next week and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will hold another meeting with the Ukrainians, following his talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi yesterday. Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Aamer Madhani, Isobel Koshiw, and Konstantin Toropin report for AP News.

Zelenskyy wants to meet with Trump “as soon as possible,” to finalize a joint U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on the terms for ending the war, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak told Axios. While U.S. and Ukrainian officials have agreed in principle on most aspects of the now 19-point plan, Zelenskyy wants to negotiate on the matter of territorial concessions himself with Trump, Yermak said. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report.

Bloomberg News yesterday reported that Steve Witkoff had a phone call last month with a senior Russian official, Yuri Ushakov, to suggest they work together on a peace plan for Ukraine and said Putin should raise the idea with Trump, giving advice on how Putin should pitch it. The White House yesterday did not dispute the veracity of the reported call transcript and praised Witkoff for his discussions with Russian officials. “It’s a standard thing,” Trump said, adding, “that’s what a dealmaker does.” Alexander Ward reports for the Wall Street Journal.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Hamas yesterday handed over the body of a deceased Israeli hostage to Israel. After forensic testing, the Israeli government identified the body as Dror Or. The bodies of two hostages are still in Gaza. Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

Heavy rain yesterday caused further flooding in Gaza, swamping the tents of thousands of Palestinians. The Palestinian Civil Defence Service said that some tents have completely washed away as floodwaters rose 40 to 50 centimetres above ground level over the past week. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said yesterday that “lifesaving humanitarian aid must enter Gaza without obstruction and at scale,” following reports from the U.N. on Monday that Israel continues to limit aid deliveries into Gaza. Reuters reports; Wafaa Shurafa and Megan Janetsky report for AP News.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“We have presented a strong text for a truce, but neither the [Sudanese Army] nor the [Rapid Support Forces] paramilitary have formally accepted the text we put forward,” U.S. envoy Massad Boulos said yesterday. Boulos said he welcomed the RSF’s declaration on Monday that its forces would enter a unilateral ceasefire immediately and hoped it would be upheld. A spokesperson for the Sudanese government said the RSF’s announcement was a “clear political manoeuvre” meant to distract from atrocities carried out by RSF fighters. The Sudanese Army said yesterday that it had repelled an attack in the West Kordofan state. Federico Maccioni reports for Reuters.

Médecins Sans Frontières said yesterday that it has withdrawn its staff from Zalingei Hospital in Darfur after a stretcher bearer, working for Sudan’s health ministry, was shot dead. “Our teams cannot resume humanitarian activities until the Rapid Support Forces guarantee safe conditions to protect staff and patients,” MSF Emergency Coordinator Myrian Laaroussi said. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Brazil’s Supreme Court yesterday ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to start serving his 27-year sentence at a federal police facility in Brasília for overseeing a failed plot to overturn the results of the 2022 election. Ana Ionova reports for the New York Times.

A group of 24 Nigerian girls who were abducted from their boarding school over a week ago have been released, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu said yesterday. More than 250 children abducted from St Mary’s Catholic School last week are still missing. James Chater and Mayeni Jones report for BBC News.

“We will crush all foreign interference” in Taiwan, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office told reporters today, adding “Japan’s deployment of offensive weapons in areas adjacent to China’s Taiwan region is extremely dangerous, deliberately creating regional tensions and provoking military confrontation.” Reuters reports.

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te today announced that his government will introduce a $40 billion special budget for military spending, focussed on acquiring more weapons from the United States. “History demonstrates that compromising with aggressors ultimately brings only endless aftermaths of war and subjugation,” Lai said in his announcement. Chris Buckley and Amy Chang Chien report for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) meeting last week grew tense when the two began discussing whether Saudi Arabia might join the Abraham Accords, according to two U.S. officials. The sources said that MBS explained to Trump that he wanted to move forward with normalization with Israel, but he cannot do so now because Saudi public opinion is highly anti-Israel, adding that Saudi society is not ready for such a move. One source said that the conversation between the two leaders was civil but tough. Barak Ravid and Marc Caputo report for Axios.

Zipline yesterday announced that it will receive $150 million from the State Department to expand commercial drone deliveries of blood, vaccines, and other medical supplies to Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, and Côte d’Ivoire. The agreement, under a new pay-for-performance model, will tie the release of taxpayer funds to Zipline’s ability to negotiate expansion contracts with the governments of these five African countries. Joann Muller reports for Axios.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Justice Department yesterday acknowledged in a court filing that it was Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who decided to proceed with the deportation of 100 Venezuelan men to a prison in El Salvador despite a judge’s order to keep them in U.S. custody. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Special agents at the Homeland Security Department have made fewer arrests for drug crimes and seized fewer weapons than in the previous fiscal year, with the number of arrests for civil immigration offences soaring from around 5,000 to over 94,500, according to an internal Homeland Security Investigations report reviewed by the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The six Democratic lawmakers who recorded a video informing troops that they could refuse illegal orders said yesterday that they are being investigated by the FBI. The group said that the FBI had contacted the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, requesting interviews with each of them. “President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress,” the four House members who took part in the video said in a joint statement. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth yesterday requested a briefing on the status of the inquiry into Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) from the Department of the Navy by Dec. 10. Greg Jaffe reports for the New York Times.

Republican and Democratic attorneys general from 35 states and the District of Columbia yesterday urged congressional leaders not to block state AI laws, warning of “disastrous consequences” if the technology is left unregulated. “Every state should be able to enact and enforce its own AI regulations to protect its residents,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the effort with attorneys general in North Carolina, Utah and New Hampshire. Jody Godoy reports for Reuters.

35 former employees of the General Services Administration, who were laid off during the government shutdown, have appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, arguing that they should have been reinstated under the spending law that ended the shutdown. The law includes a provision that reverses any layoff that occurred during the lapse in federal spending that began on Oct. 1. The Trump administration argues that the provision does not cover those whose terminations had been set in motion before the shutdown began. Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

Former Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who was fired from the DOJ earlier this year, has joined Democracy Forward, one of the legal advocacy firms challenging the Trump administration’s approaches to immigration, benefits, and civil rights. Reuveni told the New York Times, “This is really a make-or-break moment for the rule of law, for democracy, for the rights of all people who live in this country.” Devlin Barrett reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Education Department is reviewing safety standards and “ongoing compliance issues” at the University of California, Berkeley, in response to a Nov. 10 Turning Point USA event, the department announced yesterday. The department’s Office of Federal Student Aid will investigate whether UC Berkeley violated the Clery Act, which requires higher education institutions that receive federal funding to disseminate crime data to the public, support victims of violence, and publicly outline their policies and systems for improving campus safety. Helen Coster reports for Reuters.

The U.S. Space Force has awarded about six small Golden Dome contracts to build up competing missile defense prototypes, according to two sources. The sources said that the awards went to several companies, including Northrop Grumman, True Anomaly, Lockheed Martin, and Anduril. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge yesterday ruled that a nationwide class of individuals who were living in the United States when they were detained by immigration authorities are legally entitled to a hearing to determine whether they can be released on bond while their deportation cases proceed. The judge ruled last week that the Trump administration’s policy adopted in July of denying bond hearings to migrants during domestic enforcement operations was illegal for specific individuals. Yesterday’s decision extended her ruling nationwide. Daniel Wiessner reports for Reuters.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) yesterday filed a lawsuit against Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte, claiming that Pulte breached federal privacy laws by repeatedly disclosing documents intended to accuse prominent Democrats of mortgage fraud. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

A coalition of 20 states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, yesterday filed a lawsuit against the Department of Housing and Urban Development, seeking a court order blocking the “administration’s cuts and illegal new conditions” on the HUD’s Continuum of Care program funding. “These funds help keep tens of thousands of people from sleeping on the streets every night. I will not allow this administration to cut off these funds and put vital housing and support services at risk,” James said yesterday.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads—a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.
The group is urging Microsoft to end its ""$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data.""
DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.
""To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company.","A Gen Z-led advocacy group fighting for working-class priorities on Tuesday announced a boycott campaign targeting major corporations ""that enable, profit from, or directly collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the broader racist policies of the Trump administration.""

Beyond the Ballot launched ""Not With My Dollars: ICE Out of My Wallet"" as President Donald Trump's violent crackdown on immigrants in diverse communities across the United States continues and just days before Black Friday kicks off the winter holiday shopping season.

""We cannot out-organize a fascist administration while simultaneously bankrolling the companies profiting from its cruelty,"" said Victor Rivera, the organization's executive director, in a statement. ""Every dollar spent at a complicit corporation is a dollar funding the abduction and disappearance of our neighbors. It’' time to make corporate complicity unprofitable, for good.""

The group is taking aim at e-commerce behemoth Amazon and its grocery subsidiary, Whole Foods; tech giants Dell and Microsoft; Home Depot; streaming platform Spotify; and retail chain Target. The boycott webpage explains the reason each is listed, actions shoppers should take, and the campaign's demands. In some cases, it also offers alternative companies.

Target is under fire for its ""broad range of cooperation with the Trump administration's racist policies."" The campaign is calling on the company to not only publicly commit to refusing collaboration with ICE but also immediately reinstate its scrapped diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads—a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.

The campaign site calls out Home Depot because it has ""repeatedly allowed ICE agents to patrol and detain workers and customers in its parking lots and stores, usually without presenting judicial warrants or establishing probable cause,"" and demands an end to those practices.

The group is urging Microsoft to end its ""$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data."" The Dell section highlights that it has provided $18.8 million to ""support the office of ICE's chief information officer through the purchase of Microsoft enterprise software licenses,"" and similarly calls for terminating that contract with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Amazon section states:

REASON: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, selling the cloud power that helps track, target, and tear families apart.

ACTION: Stop shopping on Amazon where possible; cancel Prime subscriptions if feasible; push universities, unions, nonprofits, and campaigns to move off AWS when and where feasible, and to issue statements condemning Amazon’s role in corporate-sponsored mass deportations.

DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.

ALTERNATIVES: Bookshop.org and local bookstores; direct-from-brand purchasing; cooperatives; independent retailers.

The site also stresses that ""every dollar spent at Whole Foods directly strengthens Amazon, whose AWS platform is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, powering the tools used to track, target, and tear families apart.""

While the campaign is beginning just before Black Friday, boycott organizers aim to ensure it will ""not disappear"" after this week.

""Unlike other consumer boycotts, Not With My Dollars is designed for long-term pressure and escalation,"" Beyond the Ballot said. ""To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company. Anything less is not accountability, just more corporate PR.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62239830&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:28.317732

Maintaining contact once they arrive in their home countries is complicated, and continuing their defense is very difficult, since U.S. immigration lawyers cannot practice there.
In these cases, it’s necessary to try to contact other local human rights organizations that can continue their advocacy.","Secrecy and the loss of contact with family members and lawyers have characterized the deportations to third countries carried out by the Trump administration as part of its campaign against immigrants. An uncertain fate and no guarantees about the conditions endured by individuals sent to countries with which they have no ties have been the norm in these expulsions. Over time, many of them have ended up back in the countries they originally fled, where they face persecution or torture.

This is the case of Rabbiatu Kuyateh, who has made headlines because of a viral video documenting the mistreatment she suffers. In it, this 58-year-old nurse from Maryland is seen being violently dragged along the ground by men who appear to be officials from Ghana, the country to which she was deported days earlier. Kuyateh resisted in vain to avoid being sent back to Sierra Leone, the country where she was born and which she fled, and where she is currently in hiding.

Hers is a story like that of many migrants who, through the Administration’s stratagems, have ended up in the countries they fled without the U.S. government actually violating its own rules against sending them there directly. Instead, they have done so through a third government, such as Ghana’s. The White House maintains that it had guarantees that those deported to this African country would not be sent back to their countries of origin, but there are serious doubts about whether this was the case. This is especially true after the Ghana government itself denied the existence of any such agreement. Immigration experts see this as a strategy by Washington to protect itself from potential litigation.

“It was a solution to a problem: ‘We can remove these people from our custody and at the same time not break the law,’” Alexandra Williams, one of the lawyers on Kuyateh’s legal team, explained to EL PAÍS. The Sierra Leonean woman arrived in the U.S. 30 years ago fleeing the war in her country, where, due to her family’s political activism, she suffered torture and persecution.

She worked as a nurse in Maryland, where she had built a life. Her son, now an adult, was born in the U.S., while her parents were naturalized American citizens. Kuyateh, for her part, had a work permit and was under supervision, but it was enough to attend annual immigration checks. Everything seemed to be in order. “She went to those appointments every year to confirm that she was still in the country. She has no criminal record, and her address was up to date. She never missed an appointment,” says Williams, who explains that her client had protection against deportation to Sierra Leone.

Everything changed with the Trump administration, and her July appointment turned into an ambush. “They told her that because of the changes in the administration and its policies, they had to arrest her and remove her from the country, since she had a deportation order,” Williams says.

Her son hasn’t seen her since. She was arrested and, after a few days, transferred to a detention center in Louisiana. The next destination was Ghana. On the flight, she was accompanied by other migrants, handcuffed and shackled, like her, with the same uncertain fate. Over the phone, she told her son about the brutality with which they were treated, a brutality that also left its mark through injuries on her body.

The African nation is one of the latest destinations the Trump administration has chosen to send migrants it cannot directly return to their countries of origin because they have court-ordered protection. According to Human Rights First, which tracks deportation flights, the United States has carried out at least 21 flights with people from third countries to 10 destinations: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Eswatini, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uzbekistan. In addition, thousands of people have been transported to Mexico by land.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempts to carry out the transfers secretly and as quickly as possible. In April, Massachusetts federal judge Brian E. Murphy issued a preliminary injunction requiring the government to give people at least 15 days to challenge their deportations to third countries, where they may face retaliation. However, two months later, the Supreme Court granted a stay, overturning Murphy’s order.

Human rights organizations denounce the violation of a basic principle of U.S. and international law that prohibits deporting people to a place where they may suffer torture, persecution, or other serious harm. But the administration is not giving detainees time to express their fears, as happened to Kuyateh, who was not allowed to voice her fear of being deported to Ghana, much less back to Sierra Leone.

The organization AMICA reports that deportations to third countries, followed by subsequent return to the countries from which people fled, have increased in recent weeks. “There are many people in that situation. Several have been deported to Mexico and are at risk of being sent back to their country of origin,” says Kelly Rojas, an immigration attorney with AMICA. Rojas declined to provide specific cases due to concerns for her clients’ safety. One of them was also sent to Ghana and then transferred to the West African country he fled, despite having a protective order preventing it. When he was deported, the lawyers lost contact and, as is often the case, received no information about where he was sent. “This person disappeared from the system. We called several ICE offices, and they told us different things about where he had been transferred,” Rojas recounts.

Maintaining contact once they arrive in their home countries is complicated, and continuing their defense is very difficult, since U.S. immigration lawyers cannot practice there. In these cases, it’s necessary to try to contact other local human rights organizations that can continue their advocacy. Exhaustion and hopelessness lead many to eventually give up. “What the United States government is doing right now is killing their will to fight for their rights. Some clients who are deported to their countries of origin have been in detention for so long that, even though their lives are in danger—which is why a judge in the United States issued them protective orders—they think that at least they are no longer in the detention center,” Rojas maintains.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/MVVITL2LILSZZF4GNDEGMAWZFY.jpg?auth=f0547454fd9ee03a2321c32b8893cc9826b3e0897d809fdf46741000d240ed35&width=1200,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:40.434837

Right now, that’s where a lot of the leverage is, pressuring state and local governments not to enter into these agreements with private prison firms.” Contracts with these firms could be ended quickly, according to the disclosures obtained by CMD.","This article is published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy.

On an August 7 earnings call, Damon Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic, announced that the country’s largest private prison operator “is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment … We are in an unprecedented environment with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide and a continuing need for solutions.”

Indeed, the Trump administration has delivered massive profits for private prison operators, with CoreCivic reporting an 18 percent revenue growth year over year for the third quarter, and GEO Group, the largest contractor working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), boasting record-breaking third-quarter earnings up 13 percent over the same period last year.

More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook

But while much of the rapid growth of both GEO and CoreCivic is tied to Trump’s immigration detention policies, these companies also rely on existing lucrative revenue streams from state and local communities. Whether it’s Vermont shipping prisoners to a CoreCivic facility in Mississippi or California using a historic LGBT gathering space for a GEO Group re-entry facility in San Francisco, a Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) review reveals that the architecture the Trump administration is using for its broad-based crackdown on immigrants relies on a pre-existing infrastructure: a privatized prison system built with the support of both political parties, much of it developed and implemented at the local level.

In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), GEO Group discloses that only 62 percent of its 2024 revenue came from the federal Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service. Last year, CoreCivic earned just 51 percent of its revenue from the same sources. Both companies rely on state and local governments and other federal agencies for their remaining revenue.

The fact that many state and local governments often put the profits of private investors above best practices for rehabilitation and re-entry has helped create the infrastructure for the Trump administration’s often lawless crackdown, according to prison reform advocates. But since many of these contracts with state and local governments include quick termination clauses, activists have the power to make a meaningful impact on the bottom line of these prison companies.

“Any state leadership that takes issue with what the administration is currently doing in terms of immigration detention—as enabled by the private prison industry—[has a duty to look] at ways to cut ties with the industry entirely,” notes Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, which advocates for dismantling the private prison complex.

“Whether it’s helping with corrections management or … with re-entry services … [these companies] have shown their cards as to who they are and really should have no role [with ICE or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] at all,” Tylek told CMD. “There’s no doubt that this industry is facilitating and enabling the rapid arrests, detention, and deportation of undocumented people, [along with] the harassment of communities of color, whether they are citizens or not.”

Both before the current immigration crackdown and since the beginning of this year, GEO Group and CoreCivic have been called out for widespread human rights violations at their immigration detention centers. Just this month, immigrant detainees in California sued ICE over conditions at a CoreCivic facility near Bakersfield, alleging it is riddled with insect infestations and sewage problems, and that they were denied access to water, food, and attorneys. This month, immigration detention inmates and their advocates in Louisiana alleged denial of medical care and inhumane overcrowding. In 2024, detained immigrants sued GEO over alleged widespread sexual abuse at a facility in California, and the Department of Justice opened an investigation into CoreCivic for an alleged culture of physical violence and sexual abuse at a private prison in Tennessee.

Blue-State Private Prison Contracts

Despite passing a law in 2019 to ban private prisons, California approved a new ten-year, $70 million contract with CoreCivic in 2024 for “re-entry services.” In addition, the state has multiyear contracts with GEO for over $300 million, for the same purpose, according to documents obtained by CMD through open records requests. Re-entry services refers to the process of reintegrating people in the criminal justice system or drug and alcohol treatment networks into mainstream society. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in October that bars California from enforcing the law against federally contracted immigration detention centers for now.

In July, a resident at a GEO Group facility in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco fled the facility and died, leading the city’s District 5 Supervisor Bilal Mahmood to call for an investigation, while human rights advocates called for closing the facility entirely.

In Arizona, which has a Democratic governor (Katie Hobbs) and a Democratic attorney general (Kris Mayes), nearly 3,000 inmates are sent to CoreCivic’s La Palma Correctional Center and more than 2,000 inmates are at its Red Rock Correctional Facility. Six inmates have died at these facilities this year alone.

In addition, Arizona recently sold a prison to Management & Training Corporation, which also detains people for ICE, for $15 million. Arizona also outsources the operation of four state prisons to GEO Group: the Central Arizona Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility and Florence West Correctional and Rehabilitation, both in Florence; Kingman Correctional in Kingman; and Phoenix West in Phoenix—for a total of 6,000 beds.

In Colorado, where Democrats control both houses of the legislature and every statewide office, the state has two major contracts with CoreCivic for a total of over 3,000 beds at the Bent County Correctional Facility in Las Animas and the Crowley County Correctional Facility in Olney Springs. CoreCivic also operates “community treatment centers” for Democratic-controlled Boulder, Adams, and Arapahoe Counties in Colorado. Arapahoe County outsources a 202-bed “residential center” to GEO Group, and the state has two GEO Group “day reporting centers.” CoreCivic is represented by the lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, whose chairman Norm Brownstein is “close” to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

Vermont, which has a moderate Republican governor (Phil Scott) and a Democratic majority in the legislature, ships 250 of its inmates to a CoreCivic facility in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. In addition, the state has established itself as a center for reinsurance and captive insurance companies, and hosts GEO Group’s captive insurance subsidiary, Florina, which is set up to help reduce liability insurance costs for the company.

In Pennsylvania, which has a Democratic governor (Josh Shapiro) and a Democratic House, the state outsources a 142-bed “community corrections” facility in Chester County, along with a similar 100-bed facility in Scranton and a drug and alcohol treatment center in Reading, to GEO Group. The state also contracts with GEO to operate six “day reporting centers” with state and county authorities.

New Mexico has long been at the forefront of prison privatization, which began in earnest under libertarian former Gov. Gary Johnson, who was a Republican at the time. However, despite the fact that Democrats have controlled every statewide office and the legislature for the past seven years, New Mexico signed a new lease to rent the 596-bed Northwest New Mexico Corrections Center from CoreCivic in 2021. In addition, GEO Group runs two “community corrections” facilities for the state.

Democratic-controlled jurisdictions in red states also contract with CoreCivic and GEO Group. For example, Hinds County, Mississippi (home to Jackson), and Harris County, Texas (Houston), send inmates to a CoreCivic facility in Tallahatchie, Mississippi.

“This is an industry that has celebrated the Trump crackdown on immigrants as basically fundamental to the conditions they need in order to succeed,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, told CMD. “What I wouldn’t want people to miss is that, yes, the current administration is massively expanding the system even more, but they’re doing it on top of an infrastructure that has been [built] by both parties. GEO and CoreCivic have played a big role in that, both in their relationship with ICE and DHS, but also with their contracts with local governments.”

“This expansion of the system has gone through both parties,” Ghandehari reiterates. “The companies are in this to make a lot of money—[and] they’re excited to be cashing in [given that] 90 percent of people in ICE detention are in private facilities. Trump and [DHS Secretary Kristi] Noem couldn’t follow through [on their crackdown] without private prison companies. Right now, that’s where a lot of the leverage is, pressuring state and local governments not to enter into these agreements with private prison firms.”

Contracts with these firms could be ended quickly, according to the disclosures obtained by CMD. GEO Group’s SEC filing states that its “facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to 180 days.” CoreCivic’s filing states that most of its facility contracts “also contain clauses that allow the government agency to terminate the contract at any time without cause.”",https://prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CMD-Private-prisons-112625.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:42.999488

Third country deportations should not be used as a tool for immigration enforcement. Often used as a tool to manage a politicized migration “problem,” third country deportations have the potential to normalize rights-free zones, forced exile, and indefinite detention. In February 2025, DHS issued a policy directive on third country deportations. The policy proposes forcibly deporting noncitizens, even those with humanitarian relief, to a third country instead of a country that is their country of nationality or where they last resided. Third country deportations immediately sparked legal challenges over safety, due process, and human rights concerns.

The United States is not the first country to propose or conduct third country deportations, despite the serious human rights concerns they raise. The United Kingdom, the European Union, and Australia have all proposed third country return schemes as a tool for migration control, immigration enforcement, and domestic approval.

Orderly migration can and must include plans for safe and voluntary returns. UNHCR has recommended that better systems are needed to ensure that people who are not in need of refugee protection retain meaningful agency in their decision-making. Options such as voluntary repatriation, access to other lawful migration pathways, or the ability to legally move to another country are all rights-respecting approaches that can be reflected in domestic policy.

Policymakers should take pause and question if current policies proposed and in use around the world are indeed the best approach. As new policies are pursued by governments who are failing to prioritize dignity and compassion in an effort to respond to global failures, it will be more important than ever for organizations like USCRI and others to monitor these efforts.

UK – Third Country Offshoring

In April 2022, the UK Government under Conservative leadership announced the UK- Rwanda Asylum Partnership. Under the agreement, the UK would send people seeking asylum to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed. Rwanda built facilities that were fenced in, and it’s unclear whether asylum seekers would have had freedom of movement or opportunities to work. If asylum was granted, asylees could reenter the UK. If asylum was denied, individuals would be offered a chance to apply for asylum in Rwanda. Several countries have employed push-back strategies to offshore asylum, but the UK-Rwanda agreement was one of the first to propose sending asylum seekers who had entered UK soil to a third country on another continent to process their asylum cases.

In its justifications, the UK Government used divisive, politicized talking points—that people should not be rewarded for paying smugglers or for using “illegal routes” to seek asylum. In exchange for accepting asylum seekers, Rwanda was poised to receive ₤370 million in addition to further payments for each individual they received.

Human rights advocates and international human rights organizations called the deal an erosion of refugee rights, and the UK Supreme Court ruled it unlawful because of the risk of refoulement. In July 2024, the newly elected Labour Government announced that it would scrap the UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership.

EU Return Hubs

In October 2024, the European Council (EC) proposed a “Common European System for Returns,” which will come into effect mid-2026. Any noncitizen who fails to voluntary leave the EU after exhausting their asylum application and appeals can be forcibly transferred to a third country “return hub.” The use of return hubs is also in the UK’s returns policy plan, and the government has stated that it is in discussions with a number of possible reception countries.

According to the EC, return hub agreements “can only be concluded with a third country where international human rights standards and principles in accordance with international law.” However, the EC’s proposal includes barebones safeguards, such as a monitoring mechanism and the disqualification of unaccompanied children and families with children. Despite the lack of detail, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR support the proposal, citing the need for effective return systems.

Staging returns outside of EU territory creates the risk for rights-free zones, similar to how the U.S. Government has used Guantánamo Bay. The EC’s plan includes a monitoring mechanism, but it does not detail how human rights abuses will be redressed. There are no guidelines for how return hub facilities are designed and whether they will be adequate for vulnerable groups, respect freedom of movement, or allow for the pursuit of livelihoods and education.

The EC’s proposal is endorsed by IOM and UNHCR because third country returns are limited to noncitizens who are on notice that they are legally required to leave the EU. Other countries—like Italy and the United States—are proposing much harsher third country return schemes.

Italy – A Mixed-Use Facility

In 2023, Italy’s conservative government entered into an agreement with Albania to build offshore migrant detention centers. Italy’s conservative government initially planned to detain and fast-track asylum cases at the detention center, but that plan was initially blocked by Italian judges in October 2024. The main concern at issue is that the efforts to fast-track asylum claims impermissibly increases the risk of unsafe returns. In order to avoid legal challenges, Italy announced that it would use the detention center as a “return hub,” consistent with the EC’s proposal. However, on November 13, the Italian Prime Minister stated that her government is “determined to push ahead” with the original plan to detain asylum seekers and fast-track their cases.

The Italy-Albania facilities have already become a threat to human life and human rights abuses. In April 2025, even during the limited use of the Albanian detention center, 10 suicide attempts were reported. Although Italy said that only male adults will be detained in Albania, the detention center is outfitted with playgrounds and breastfeeding areas, questioning whether the Italian government eventually plans to send children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups.

Untested, Costly, and Dangerous

The risk of human rights abuses should be enough to deter such policies from even being considered. In addition, policymakers should be concerned about wasteful governmental spending. The UK-Rwanda Asylum Partnership would have cost UK taxpayers ₤1.8 million ($2.3 million) for every asylum seeker sent to Rwanda. And until the plan was abandoned, the UK paid Rwanda ₤290 million ($381 million), which Rwanda is refusing to pay back.

The Italian detention center in Albania cost €800 million ($930 million), construction went over schedule, and the first asylum seekers sent there were immediately transferred back to Italy due to legal challenges. Governments are using public resources to broker controversial agreements and legally defend questionable practices. Despite claiming to act in the public interest, many agreements and official determinations are not publicly available.

Fundamental human rights, individual lives, and diplomatic relationships are at stake. Moreover, it is unclear whether “return hubs” will motivate people to return to their countries of nationality. The plan fails to address the fate of stateless persons, as well as people who had to flee their homes as children who have no familiarity with their countries of nationality. Third country deportations simply shift the burden of processing returns to a third country. Moreover, many of these schemes make indefinite detention possible.

Countries should not use return hubs or any third-country agreement as a way around international human rights commitments. Migrants are human beings, not pawns to move around on the world map. Rather than turning to untested, costly, and dangerous proposals to enforce immigration laws, countries can reinvest in durable solutions, equitable responsibility-sharing, and human rights institutions. Finally, continued attention is needed to show how rights-respecting policy models can be developed and why they provide states with a more durable, effective framework.",https://reliefweb.int/modules/custom/reliefweb_meta/images/default.png,N,,2025-11-26 09:56:46.146144

Boasberg, at a hearing last week, had named Reuveni and Ensign as people he thought likely to be witnesses.
Closing my tabs For those who don’t what this is, it’s my effort to give a little thank you to paid subscribers.","Lawyers from the ACLU who have been challenging the Trump administration’s extreme immigration enforcement on Tuesday afternoon suggested that Emil Bove, now a federal appeals court judge, should potentially be called as a witness in Chief Judge James Boasberg’s contempt inquiry over the administration’s actions regarding deportation flights that left the U.S. on March 15.

Later Tuesday evening, Justice Department lawyers — while still maintaining that further contempt-related proceedings are not appropriate — responded by stating that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ultimately made the decision not to return the flights, after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Bove “provided DHS with legal advice” about the flights and DHS’s acting counsel conveyed that advice, “as well as his own legal advice,“ to her.

“After receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,“ DOJ lawyers stated in the Tuesday night filing — more than eight months after the flights sent the people to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison.

The filings came as Boasberg moves forward — after a seven-month delay — in his contempt inquiry regarding the two flights carrying individuals who were being deported under President Donald Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation, flights that went to El Salvador even after he ordered the administration to temporarily stop with AEA-based deportations on March 15.

Bove, a former personal criminal lawyer to Trump, was initially given a senior role in the Justice Department — a common occurrence in the second Trump administration. He is unique, however, in that he has since been confirmed to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Bove also stands out because, before Senate Republicans confirmed him to the Third Circuit on a 5-49 vote*, he was involved in several ethically questionable actions from the Justice Department in the first months of the second Trump administration — including those relating to the Eric Adams case and the administration’s preparations for Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation and the litigation against it. There has since also been reporting that Bove, while at DOJ, was supportive of the boat-strike murders that the administration has been engaged in in recent months.

After much delay due to the administration’s earlier appeal of Boasberg’s first order in the contempt inquiry, Boasberg on Monday ordered the parties — the ACLU representing the plaintiffs and DOJ representing the government — to provide “proposals” for how to proceed with the court’s “inquiry regarding a potential contempt referral,” including the “names of possible witnesses.“

In its responsive filing, the ACLU lawyers propose that DOJ be ordered to identify “all individuals involved in the decision not to halt the transfer of class members out of U.S. physical custody on March 15 and 16, 2025 … as well as all those with knowledge of the decision-making process.”

Then, relying on the names identified in fired DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni’s whistleblower disclosure, the plaintiffs’ lawyers put forward nine names as potential witnesses:

In addition to Bove and Reuveni himself — who, it was announced Tuesday, has been hired by Democracy Forward, an organization that previously was (but no longer is) involved as co-counsel in the case — the “potential witnesses” include Drew Ensign, the lawyer who appeared before Boasberg in court on March 15. Boasberg, at a hearing last week, had named Reuveni and Ensign as people he thought likely to be witnesses.

Additionally, the plaintiffs’ statement names August Flentje, who was Reuveni’s supervisor at the time of the Abrego Garcia hearing that led to Reuveni’s firing, as a potential witness, along with three other senior DOJ officials (James McHenry, Paul Perkins, and Yaakov Roth) and two senior Homeland Security officials (James Percival and Mazzara, the person who DOJ stated conveyed the legal advice to Noem on March 15).

The plaintiffs’ lawyers noted that this is not an exhaustive list and that several other people unnamed in the Reuveni disclosure — within DOJ, DHS, and the State Department — also “may possess relevant information.”

In DOJ’s response, lawyers acknowledged that Boasberg’s March 15 order issued in court included the requirement that people covered by the lawsuit “be returned to the United States.”

Laying out what happened next, DOJ’s lawyers named multiple people included in the ACLU’s list, including Ensign, Bove, and Mazzara. Through DOJ’s timeline, they also added Blanche and Noem to the list:

DOJ then raised privilege questions:

The Justice Department then proceeded to spend four paragraphs quoting from and relying on Judge Gregory Katsas’s concurring opinion (only for himself) at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to provide additional argumentation that “no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate“ — an argument that DOJ had been at last week’s hearing and was rejected by Boasberg. Such argumentation was also not requested in Boasberg’s Monday order.

As a last point, DOJ objected to the “involvement” of the ACLU lawyers in the contempt proceedings altogether, arguing that, as a criminal contempt matter, “Plaintiffs … lack standing to participate as anything other than fact witnesses.“

Finally, Tuesday’s filing was signed by four DOJ lawyers — Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate, the head of the Civil Division; Ensign; Tiberius Davis, Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General; and Anthony Nicastro, the acting director of the Office of Immigration Litigation. In a second filing DOJ submitted in the case Tuesday, however, one more name was on it: Flentje — Reuveni’s former supervisor and another name on the ACLU’s list.

Now, Boasberg will decide how to proceed.

* = Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted against Bove’s confirmation. Sen. Bill Hagerty did not vote.

This report was updated to include information about the Justice Department’s filing once it was submitted. The final update was at 12:20 a.m. November 26.

According to The Washington Times, arrests are averaging about 1,200 per day.

There are also planned changes for more than 200,000 people admitted to the United States as refugees, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. (TNND)

In an interview on Tuesday on the ""Ruthless"" Podcast, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, ""Under President Trump, we got rid of catch and release, so everyone’s talking about Oh my god, immigration detention is skyrocketing; you have so many people in custody. Well, we’re not just gonna arrest someone to give you a chance to go out and do something again,"" he said.

There are also planned changes for more than 200,000 people admitted to the United States as refugees, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Most will need to be re-interviewed, U.S. C.I.S. Director Joseph Edlow, with a focus on those who came in between January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.

In a recent interview with Edlow, he voiced his concerns about both refugees and immigrants overall who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The way I look at it is, the last four years we saw unchecked mass illegal immigration. What we are trying to do is kind of unravel that knot now,"" Edlow said.

Edlow said the refugee program at the time was being exploited.

""We have to make sure that everyone who is going through the process is telling the truth on their applications, first and foremost, that they are not a threat to public safety, that they are not a threat to national security,"" Edlow said.

There is also a new spotlight on the thousands of undocumented migrants who spent days or even weeks sheltering in some U.S. airports.

A report just released by the Senate Commerce Committee alleges the Biden white house pressured Boston Logan, Chicago O'Hare and at least eight other airports to house those illegal migrants despite concerns raised by airport officials.

According to the report, ""The Biden White House, through the FAA, pressured Logan, O’Hare, and at least eight other airports to house more illegal aliens as they arrived in the United States. When asked by the administration to house aliens, the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), Logan Airport’s operator, insisted that doing so would pose security and operational risks. The FAA, along with Democratic state and local officials, overruled Massport’s warnings and allowed aliens to sleep overnight in Logan airport terminals for more than a year. ""

The hearing follows a ruling by Federal Judge Jeffrey Cummings earlier this month, who found that hundreds of ICE detainees should be released from custody because ICE agents violated the terms of a 2022 consent decree that set firm boundaries on ICE agents’ use of “warrantless” arrests.

In court filings, ICE asserted that the terms of the consent decree had expired in June.

But Judge Cummings’ ruling stated otherwise.

In his 52-page order issued in early October, Cummings found that ICE had violated the terms of the consent agreement by making “warrantless” arrests throughout 2025 – including in “Operation Midway Blitz.”

But before any of the more than 600 detainees on the list were released – most of whom ICE deemed to be a “low risk” to public safety, attorneys for the federal government appealed Judge Cummings’ ruling. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay on the release.

The matter was put on pause this month until oral arguments could be made during a hearing, which is set for next week.

Throughout the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Chicago, attorneys and family members of those arrested by Border Patrol or ICE agents have said it’s been difficult to communicate with the detainees. They’ve alleged through a separate federal lawsuit that it’s hard to make phone calls or reach those being held in ICE custody, and that an ICE website devoted to detailing where detainees are being held isn’t always working or up to date.

NBC 5 Investigates used the list of 604 ICE detainees to measure where ICE detainees from Chicago have been held across the country.

This point-in-time snapshot offers a view into where detainees have been transported to county jails and ICE detention facilities across the country.

NBC 5 Investigates’ analysis found more than 164 detainees were taken to an ICE detention facility in Baldwin, Michigan; at least 61 were taken to a facility in Texas; another 26 were placed at a detention facility in Brazil, Indiana.

At least six jails throughout Kentucky have been used to hold ICE detainees from the Chicago area.

NBC 5 Investigates could not find information for 190 people on the list of 604 people, which was made public through the ongoing litigation in Cummings’ court.

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly responded to NBC 5 Investigates’ questions over the past few months by highlighting that the enforcement efforts in the Chicago area have targeted “the worst of the worst” and that “pedophiles, gangbangers and rapists” have been processed through the ICE processing facility in Broadview, IL.

While the Trump administration initially pitched immigration enforcement in Chicago as a means to address crime, immigration data from the TRAC website shows between 70 to 80 percent of those in ICE custody do not have criminal convictions, NBC 5 Investigates has found.

Court records show at least 75 people on the list of more than 600 have been removed from the U.S.

Rodrigo Domingo-Hipolito is one of those 75.

His name is on the list of 604 people who a federal judge says should be eligible for release from ICE custody.

But he has already self-deported.

Aside from a 2011 traffic conviction for driving on a suspended licensing – he has no criminal history.

He spoke to NBC 5 Investigates recently from Mexico – where he’s been since early November.

“Man it’s crazy. A lot of people. When I got there, there was like 90 guys inside the little room,” Rodrigo said of the Broadview facility, which has become the subject of a federal lawsuit alleging poor and inhumane conditions. DHS denies that there are poor conditions and has repeatedly said detainees received three meals a day have access to phones to communicate.

Rodrigo says he was arrested by immigration agents on his way to work in Cicero on October 3rd. He says he spent nearly six days at Broadview before being transported to an ICE detention facility in Oklahoma.

Online immigration court records show an immigration judge approved his request to voluntarily deport himself on October 21.

Rodrigo says he chose to do so because of health reasons and that after consulting with immigration attorneys, he saw no other options.

“At that point I was thinking it was the right thing to do because I don’t want to spend any more time in the jail because of my health. It was not well so, and I don’t want to spend more time on jail,” he said.

He says he was later transported to a jail in Louisiana where he was held for several more days. Documents he shared with NBC 5 Investigates show he was offered a $1,000 to self-deport through a DHS program. He says he has yet to receive the money.

He says conditions there were just as packed as what he experienced at Broadview and people got sick. He became upset when talking about the other detainees there whose families don’t know where they are.

“I think outside there is a lot of people – a lot of guys they need help a lot of people they never know if their family knows that they are inside,” he said.

The decision to self-deport was heartbreaking for him and his fiancé, Claudia, who asked not to use her last name because she – like Rodrigo – is undocumented.

“I feel a huge emptiness,” she said through tears. “I feel destroyed. Very destroyed.”

She told NBC 5 Investigates she is hopeful that he can return one day legally through obtained a visa because they had plans to settle down and buy a home together. They’ve been together for more than 10 years and now they’ve have no plans to see each other currently.

Since June, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is believed to have netted more than 3,300 arrests in the Chicago area. Attorneys estimate nearly 60 percent of those have been removed from the U.S.

While initially pitched as crime combatant, critics and those on the receiving end of the immigration enforcement efforts argue it has done little to address crime on a grand scale in Chicago, and instead has separated families.

“Yeah, man. It’s hard because 24 years living there. Now it’s a new beginning,” Rodrigo said.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2021/02/ICE-BERMUDEZ.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-11-26 11:00:23.426668

The review is likely to sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during that period. It is likely to face legal challenges from advocates, some of whom said the move was part of the administration’s “cold-hearted treatment” of people trying to build new lives in the U.S.

The memo, signed by the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, and dated Friday, said that during the Biden years “expediency” and “quantity” were prioritized over “detailed screening and vetting.” The memo said that warranted a comprehensive review and “re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.”

The memo indicated that there will be a list of people to re-interview within three months.

Advocates of the refugee program say that refugees are generally some of the most vetted of all people coming to the United States and that they often wait years to be able to come.

The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the U.S. during the stated time period.

If the agency determines that a person shouldn’t have qualified for entry as a refugee, the person “has no right to appeal,” according to the memo, although if they are put in removal proceedings and sent to immigration court, they can then plead their case there. The memo also stated that even those who have already received their green card would be reviewed.

“USCIS is ready to uphold the law and ensure the refugee program is not abused,” Edlow wrote.

People admitted to the U.S. as refugees are required to apply for a green card one year after they arrive in the country and usually five years after that can apply for citizenship.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The moves described in the memo are the latest to take aim at the refugee program, which the administration suspended earlier this year and later set a limit for entries to 7,500 mostly white South Africans — a historic low of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. since the program’s inception in 1980. The Trump administration more broadly has ramped up immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.

The Biden administration admitted 185,640 refugees from October 2021 through September 2024. Refugee admissions topped 100,000 last year, with the largest numbers coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela and Syria.

Refugee advocates slammed news of the review, saying that it will traumatize people who have already gone through extensive vetting to make it to the U.S. in the first place.

“This plan is shockingly ill-conceived,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy and advocacy at HIAS, a refugee resettlement agency. “This is a new low in the administration’s consistently cold-hearted treatment of people who are already building new lives and enriching the communities where they have made their homes.”

USCIS expects to have a priority list for re-interviews within 90 days, Edlow wrote. His language points to a rigorous revisiting of why refugee status was granted in the first place.

“Testimony will include, but is not limited to, the circumstances establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear for principal refugees, the persecutor bar, and any other potential inadmissibilities,” he wrote.

Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project, an advocacy group, criticized the administration’s actions in a statement late Monday, saying that refugees are “already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States.”

“Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years,” Aly said.

IRAP is currently part of a lawsuit seeking to overturn the administration’s suspension of refugee admissions.

In a decision issued on Monday, Justice Anne Turley dismissed Mohammadreza Vadiati’s application for judicial review, finding that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) had acted fairly and reasonably when it ruled him inadmissible under section 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which bars members of terrorist organizations.

Vadiati, who served two years as a conscript in the IRGC before seeking asylum in Canada, argued that his service was involuntary and that immigration officials failed to account for coercion or the impact on his family.

The court rejected those claims, saying he was given a full opportunity to respond to officials’ concerns.

“The applicant has failed to establish any procedural unfairness in the decision-making process,” Justice Turley wrote, concluding that conscription in the IRGC “does not negate membership in the group” under the immigration law.

What Does Canada's IRGC Terror Listing Really Mean?

Under Canada’s anti-terrorism laws, membership in or support for a listed terrorist entity can result in inadmissibility, asset freezes, and criminal penalties.

The listing of the IRGC – which Canada blames for human rights abuses and the 2020 downing of flight PS752 – has broad implications for thousands of Iranian nationals who performed compulsory service.

Canadian politicians, including MP Kevin Vuong and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, have said the listing aims to curb Tehran’s influence in Canada and prevent IRGC-linked individuals from operating on Canadian soil.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, a Brazil native and the mother of Leavitt’s nephew, was arrested near Boston on November 12, her attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN.

Leavitt’s nephew has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father, Leavitt’s brother Michael, since he was born, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Ferreira and the White House press secretary have not spoken in many years, the source said.

A spokesperson with the Department of Homeland Security told CNN Ferreira was in the US illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that required her to leave the country in June 1999. Ferreira “has a previous arrest for battery” and is currently in removal proceedings, the spokesperson said.

Ferreira’s attorney said she was a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which grants temporary protection from deportation for those brought to the US as children.

She was unable to renew her status a few years ago during President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the program during his first administration, but is currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship, Pomerleau said.

Michael Leavitt told CNN affiliate WMUR Ferreira has maintained a relationship with their son, but the boy has not spoken to her since her detention. He described the situation as difficult and said he just wants the best for his son.

A GoFundMe page, verified by Ferreira’s lawyer, has been created by her sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, for legal fees and expenses. As of Wednesday morning, more than $15,000 has been raised.

“Bruna was brought to the United States by our parents in December of 1998, when she was just a child … Since then, she has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,” Ferreira’s sister wrote in the GoFundMe campaign. She said Ferreira has “maintained her legal status through DACA.”

Twenty states are suing the Trump administration over cuts made to funding for housing the homeless.

A coalition of 19 attorneys general and two governors made the move Tuesday to seek a court order that would block “cuts and illegal new conditions” to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care program, which works with local organizations to connect unhoused people with resources and housing.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced that more than half of the program’s 2026 funding for permanent housing will be cut and reallocated to temporary transitional housing with work or service requirements. The new conditions will also allow HUD to deny funding to any organizations that acknowledge transgender or nonbinary people.

This month, HUD instituted a cap on the amount of its program funds that can go to permanent housing at 30 percent. Previously, no cap existed, and 90 percent of its funds supported permanent housing.

The lawsuit argues that the conditions placed on the program are “unlawful and unconstitutional” because the funds were mandated by Congress to be distributed based on need. New York Attorney General Letitia James, the coalition’s leader, said in a press release that “communities across the country depend on Continuum of Care funds to provide housing and other resources to our most vulnerable neighbors.”

“These funds help keep tens of thousands of people from sleeping on the streets every night. I will not allow this administration to cut off these funds and put vital housing and support services at risk,” James said.

At a time when the country is in the midst of a housing crisis exacerbated by the Trump administration, these cuts will make things even worse if they are allowed to stand. Americans who end up losing their homes already have a tough time getting assistance. If this lawsuit doesn’t stop or slow the administration’s cuts, Americans without homes will get even less from the government.

Kash Patel’s days as FBI director may be numbered.

MS NOW reported Tuesday that President Trump is considering firing the embattled director as his errors pile up. Three anonymous sources told MS NOW that Patel had drawn Trump’s ire for his presumptuous social media posts during ongoing cases, using a government jet for a date night with his 27-year-old girlfriend, and assigning a SWAT team for her security detail.

Andrew Bailey, the FBI co–deputy director, is reportedly Trump’s top choice to replace Patel.

The White House responded to the reports. “President Trump has assembled the most talented and impressive Administration in history and they are doing an excellent job carrying out the President’s agenda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “FBI Director Patel is a critical member of the President’s team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the FBI.”

This isn’t the first time Patel’s FBI has witnessed rumors of internal upheaval. Just last month, Patel reportedly angered FBI leadership when he fired at least 30 bureau agents for being hostile to conservatism or Trump. And in October, he pissed off Trump and Justice Department officials by posting that the “FBI thwarted a potential terrorist attack” on Halloween, despite the fact that no charges had been filed and local police didn’t have any details.

Back in July, deputy director and former MAGA podcaster Dan Bongino was so upset with how Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi handled the release of the Epstein files—from Bondi claiming that she had them on her desk to her then claiming the case was closed—that he skipped work, no call no show.

It seems clear that Patel is working on borrowed time. It shouldn’t come as any surprise that one of the most underqualified FBI leads in recent memory can’t seem to avoid these screw-ups.

This story has been updated.

Kash Patel’s FBI is joining the hunt against the so-called “Seditious Six,” signaling the administration’s commitment to taking revenge on the six Democratic members of Congress who dared tell soldiers that they didn’t have to follow illegal orders.

The FBI has requested interviews with Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin, and Representatives Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan—all military and intelligence veterans—for their participation in the now-infamous video in which they reminded the military that they swore an oath to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution, not President Trump. The Trump administration saw this as treasonous, called for them to be hanged, and is weighing court-martialing Kelly.

The six members of Congress have yet to respond to the potential FBI interview.

It’s unclear when the interviews will occur or what exactly they entail. An anonymous Justice Department official told Reuters that the interviews would be to see “if there’s any wrongdoing and then go from there.” The FBI has yet to comment on the interviews, but one can assume that it won’t be very amicable given the Trump administration’s rhetoric around the situation.

“The video made by the ‘Seditious Six’ was despicable, reckless, and false,” Hegseth wrote Monday on his personal X account. “Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of ‘good order and discipline.’ Their foolish screed sows doubt and confusion—which only puts our warriors in danger.”

Meanwhile, what Kash is up to:

The Department of Government Efficiency is claiming that it is still operational, despite reports that the agency has disbanded.

In a post on X Monday night, the account called a Reuters article reporting that the agency “doesn’t exist” with eight months remaining on its charter “fake news.”

“As usual, this is fake news from @Reuters,” the post read. “President Trump was given a mandate by the American people to modernize the federal government and reduce waste, fraud and abuse. Just last week, DOGE terminated 78 wasteful contracts and saved taxpayers $335M. We’ll be back in a few days with our regularly scheduled Friday update. 🇺🇸”

DOGE has not posted since then, or offered any proof of the cuts. It also didn’t refute a key piece of information in the Reuters article: that DOGE is no longer a “centralized entity.” Its acting administrator, Amy Gleason, is now an official adviser to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the Department of Health and Human Services, even as she makes jokes on LinkedIn.

Many of DOGE’s functions have been taken over by the Office of Personnel Management, and many of its employees have moved to other agencies within the government. So what does the X post mean? Maybe DOGE is still a tool in the hands of Elon Musk and Russell Vought, or a scapegoat whenever the Trump administration wants to make massive cuts.

Whatever the case, the massive damage DOGE caused to the federal bureaucracy will live on and probably continue for the rest of the Trump administration. Whether the name lives on is another story.

A well-timed phone call from House Speaker Mike Johnson may have been the tipping point for the White House to call off releasing Donald Trump’s new health care plan.

Ahead of the decision Monday, Johnson cautioned Trump officials against including a two-year extension to Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of the president’s so-called “Healthcare Price Cuts Act,” The Wall Street Journal reported.

Johnson reportedly told White House officials that Republicans just couldn’t get behind extending subsidies, after the speaker had spent more than a month railing against Democrats’ bid to save the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. Should those tax credits permanently lapse, an estimated 5.1 million Americans will lose their health coverage by 2034.

Johnson’s decision to throw a wrench in Trump’s rollout comes as insurance premiums are set to skyrocket starting in January, and premiums for individuals will increase by as much as double for millions of Americans.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is attacking the Scouts for not being nice enough to boys.

Hegseth plans to cut all military ties with Scouting America, formerly known as the Boy Scouts, on the grounds that they are attacking “boy-friendly spaces,” being too “genderless,” pushing “gender confusion,” and adopting diversity, equity, and inclusion, according to a draft memo to Congress reviewed by NPR.

“The organization once endorsed by President Theodore Roosevelt no longer supports the future of American boys,” Hegseth wrote in the memo.

“The Boy Scouts has been cratering itself for quite some time,” Hegseth said in a 2024 Fox interview. “This is an institution the left didn’t control. They didn’t want to improve it. They wanted to destroy it or dilute it into something that stood for nothing.”

Under the proposal, Scouts will no longer receive medical and logistical support for their massive “National Jamboree” and will no longer be allowed to visit military bases.

The proposal has not yet been sent to Congress but would bring an end to 100 years of support from the U.S. government.

“Scouting is and has always been a nonpartisan organization,” Scouting America said in a statement responding to the news. “Over more than a century, we’ve worked constructively with every U.S. presidential administration—Democratic and Republican—focusing on our common goal of building future leaders grounded in integrity, responsibility, and community service.”

Retired Army Staff Sergeant Kenny Green—who has three children who are scouts—was caught off guard by Hegseth’s proposal.

“It’s gonna be kind of harsh the way I say this.… It’s kind of like they don’t care about us more than they care about their perceived message. Scouting … it probably is not a perfect organization, but … I can’t even say how vast their benefits are, especially for military families.”

From fat-shaming troops to complaining that soldiers have been emasculated, this is par for the course for the defense secretary.

More on what Hegseth has been up to t:

The peace plan offered by the Trump administration to end the war between Russia and Ukraine appears to contain few, if any, concessions from Russia, an administration official admitted Tuesday.

Maria Bartiromo interviewed U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker on Fox Business Tuesday morning, and pointed out that General Jack Keane, former Army vice chief of staff, told her that Russian President Vladimir Putin “hasn’t given up one concession in all of these months that [we’ve] been negotiating.”

Whitaker agreed and tried to spin what is obviously true by casting it as part of negotiations.

“There is some truth to what the general says, but let’s remember that there’s no perfect answer to this situation,” Whitaker said, adding, “Neither side is going to get what they want. We don’t know until we have a deal that’s hammered out who’s giving up what.”

Whitaker said that the Russians had a stronger position on the battlefield, and were making small gains every week, and that “unless Europe and the United States decided to take a different tack, this is where we end up, negotiating a peace deal from the reality.”

“We can all live in what-if worlds, but we have to live in the real world,” Whitaker added.

The initial plan proposed by the U.S. was heavily weighted toward Russia and even seemed to be translated from Russian, based on the syntax and vocabulary used. Even Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “the wish list of the Russians.” U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators have since modified the plan, but that’s not likely to go over well with Putin.

Why did the Trump administration go public with Russia’s ideal solution instead of bringing Ukraine in on the process earlier? Now, while the deal may be acceptable to one side, it’s likely to fall through and prolong the fighting.

At least one Republican lawmaker was so outraged by the White House’s supposed Russia-Ukraine peace plan that he considered resigning from Congress then and there.

The Trump administration unveiled a 28-point peace plan last week that catered to some of Russia’s most outrageous demands, such as requiring Ukraine to swear off NATO membership and to hand over Crimea and the eastern Donbas region. Those two details alone have reversed long-standing U.S. policy with regard to the area.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have balked at the arrangement, but Nebraska Representative Don Bacon was reportedly “so angry” at the idea that he thought about quitting the lower chamber altogether, he told Axios Monday night.

Bacon has little to lose since he’s already on track to retire—he announced in June that he will not seek reelection in 2026, capping his 10-year career in Congress in early 2027.

That’s given the 62-year-old some extra wiggle room to lament the Trump administration’s maneuverings, damning the rushed peace process as the “Witkoff Ukrainian surrender plan” after special envoy Steve Witkoff, who played a major role in crafting the deal.

“In the end I have a commitment to our constituents to fulfill my term,” Bacon told Axios, noting that he “shared [his] anger” with House Speaker Mike Johnson but opted not to mention his resignation.

Ukraine and its European partners were excluded from the plan’s drafting process, reported The Guardian. But there is some evidence that the plan may have come directly from the Kremlin: Several sentences in the document are passive and clunky in English but make more sense when translated into Russian. That could be the influence of Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s envoy, who worked on the project alongside Witkoff.

Donald Trump has touted himself for months as a great peacemaker, pushing a narrative that he has—so far—solved eight foreign conflicts. Practically all of his war-solving braggadocio is “demonstrably untrue,” to the extent that several of the examples he often lists were never even at war. But despite repeated efforts, he has not made any headway on the Russia-Ukraine war.

Trump has conceded quite a bit to Russia’s dictator, to no avail. This summer, Trump literally rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska, marking Putin’s first return to U.S. soil in more than a decade. But after the theatrics were over, the two world leaders still failed to reach a consensus on how to end the bloodshed, with Trump losing his cool while Putin demanded that Ukraine cede even more territory to Russia.

A federal judge will be deciding whether to release the three petitioners and whether to declare such detentions unlawful.","SAN DIEGO (AP) — A week before Chancely Fanfan was scheduled to attend an immigration court hearing in San Diego, he received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security instructing him to show up for what he thought would be a routine check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after his hearing.

After the 31-year-old Haitian man showed up with his wife and 11-month-old baby to his court hearing and ICE check-in on Oct. 20, immigration officers arrested him, providing no reason other than that the government required it, his attorneys said.

Fanfan had no criminal history and showed up to all his court hearings and check-ins with ICE since his arrival in the U.S. last year, according to the petition filed Tuesday in the Southern District of California. The Center for Immigration Law and Policy and the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law are challenging the October detentions of Fanfan and two others following their check-ins with immigration officers.

“Petitioners have had no criminal contact since their prior releases from DHS custody, and two petitioners have no criminal history of any kind,” according to the petition.

The petitioners were detained after entering through or between U.S. ports of entry when they came to the country. After vetting, they were released from federal custody.

The lawsuit alleges immigrants are being deprived of due process after previously being declared fit for release, only to be arrested and detained when suddenly summoned to reappear at an ICE office. Many cases involve people whose cases in immigration court were reopened.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday.

The UCLA School of Law’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy said the detentions in San Diego alone “are certainly in the dozens, and likely exceeds 100.” The lawsuit is asking the judge to certify the class, which could mean that others who were arrested and detained in similar circumstances could benefit from a favorable ruling.

A gardener from Mexico who has lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years sat on the floor of a long hallway outside a packed waiting room at ICE’s San Diego office on Monday. He spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name, Lorenzo, be published because he feared potential consequences.

About 10 years ago, Border Patrol arrested Lorenzo at a highway checkpoint in Southern California. He went before an immigration judge who closed his case and spared him from being deported. For years, he had heard nothing from immigration authorities until last week, when he was told his case was being reopened and that he was to report to ICE on Monday. He didn’t follow up with the AP after his check-in.

Arrests at ICE check-ins appear to have accelerated since early October in San Diego. Lynn Devine, a volunteer observer, saw one woman who checked in being escorted to an elevator in handcuffs by two officers on Monday.

“She was looking at the floor. I told her I was praying for her,” Devine said.

A federal judge will be deciding whether to release the three petitioners and whether to declare such detentions unlawful.

In a statement, a justice department spokesperson said: “These operations were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict.” The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.
The armed conflict designation is key because it allows Trump to operate under the so-called law of armed conflict, which permits the use of lethal force without violating federal murder statutes or international law.
But despite the plausible legal framework, the OLC opinion relies on a fact pattern about the cartels for which no public evidence appears to exist.
“A significant problem with this theory is that they still have not identified any state that’s engaged in an armed conflict with a particular cartel,” said Lederman.","The Trump administration is framing its boat strikes against drug cartels in the Caribbean in part as a collective self-defense effort on behalf of US allies in the region, according to three people directly familiar with the administration’s internal legal argument.

The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.

As a result, according to the legal analysis, the strikes are targeting the cocaine, and the deaths of anyone on board should be treated as an enemy casualty or collateral damage if any civilians are killed, rather than murder.

That line of reasoning, which forms the backbone of a classified justice department office of legal counsel (OLC) opinion, provides the clearest explanation to date how the US satisfied the conditions to use lethal force.

But it marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.

A White House official responded that Trump has not been making a legal argument. Still, Trump’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.

And it would also be the first time the US has claimed – dubiously, and contrary to the widely held understanding – that the cartels are using cocaine proceeds to wage wars, rather than to make money.

In a statement, a justice department spokesperson said: “These operations were ordered consistent with the law of armed conflict.” The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.

The new rationale being advanced by the administration comes as the legal justification gains heightened importance amid a military campaign against the cartels that shows signs of dramatically expanding.

The US now has an extraordinary force in the Caribbean with the arrival of the USS Gerald Ford, the world’s most advanced super-carrier, which brings capabilities to hit land targets, which Trump has said he wants to pursue.

And this week, defense secretary Pete Hegseth threatened senator Mark Kelly with court-martial after he recorded a video with five other Democratic lawmakers warning military members to question unlawful orders, apparently in reference to the strikes.

Cartel goals disputed

According to three lawyers directly familiar with the OLC opinion blessing the boat strikes, the collective self-defense argument is said to be a key plank of the legal analysis.

The opinion formalizes a 21 July meeting of a “restricted interagency lawyers group” of four career and four political appointees from the Pentagon, the office of the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA, the White House and the OLC.

It principally argues that the US has entered an armed conflict with the cartels because it is helping allies in the region like Mexico and Colombia, which, according to an administration official, asked for US help confidentially for fear of reprisals.

The armed conflict designation is key because it allows Trump to operate under the so-called law of armed conflict, which permits the use of lethal force without violating federal murder statutes or international law.

The opinion then finds Trump does not need congressional approval because the administration satisfied OLC’s two-prong test: whether the strikes serve a national interest, and whether they would not be of a prolonged scope, nature or duration.

For instance, it outlines four areas of national interests the strikes serve, from the duty to provide assistance to allies, to preserving regional stability, to protecting the US from the influx of illegal drugs themselves.

But despite the plausible legal framework, the OLC opinion relies on a fact pattern about the cartels for which no public evidence appears to exist.

The closest analogy is perhaps the Taliban and al-Qaida trafficking opium during the war on terror to finance its terrorist activities. But in that instance, it was clear their primary goal was to wage armed attacks against the US and Nato allies, and the opium financed their weapons.

It is uncertain whether the same applies to drug cartels in Latin America.

Martin Lederman, a former deputy assistant attorney general at OLC during the Obama and Biden administrations, expressed skepticism with the administration’s claims about collective self-defense.

“A significant problem with this theory is that they still have not identified any state that’s engaged in an armed conflict with a particular cartel,” said Lederman.

“Nor has the administration provided any evidence that another state engaged in such an armed conflict has asked the US to destroy cocaine shipments that are allegedly being used to subsidize armed violence against the requesting state,” he said.

An administration official said it had evidence that each boat carries around $50m worth of cocaine, the proceeds of which are being used to acquire sophisticated weapons, but the underlying intelligence is classified.

Still, the justice department’s OLC is not an expert in assessing the intelligence findings or the purported objectives of the cartels; typically, it ends up deferring to the US intelligence community.

For this opinion, a senior administration official acknowledged, OLC did not attempt to stress-test the purported goals of the cartels – or the underlying facts to determine the existence of an armed conflict.

OLC considered only a narrow question posed by the White House of whether it was a lawful policy option for the president to use military force against unflagged vessels in international waters transporting cocaine.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d2740a05fe651a2f03ede88ef788cfc97f19c9/458_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b74ebd0424db483f55a3b01b022358b8",N,,2025-11-26 04:57:12.770517

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Bruna Caroline Ferreira is a ""criminal illegal alien from Brazil"" who overstayed her tourist visa, which expired in June 1999.

The woman has an arrest on suspicion of battery, the spokesperson said. It’s not clear how the case was resolved.

Garland, extending previously granted declaratory relief to all members of the newly certified Bond Eligible Class. The ruling effectively rejects Matter of Yajure Hurtado and the related ICE policy that had long subjected certain noncitizens who entered without inspection to mandatory detention under INA § 235(b)(2)(A)—without the possibility of bond.

Background and Procedural Posture

Last Friday, the court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the named petitioners, holding that individuals who entered without admission/inspection but were not apprehended at the border are not properly detained under INA § 235(b)(2)(A). Instead, the court concluded that such individuals fall under INA § 236, the general arrest-and-detention statute that provides for custody redetermination by an immigration judge, including bond consideration.

Today’s class certification order explicitly adopts that same relief on a nationwide basis. On page 14 of the certification order, the court states:

“When considering this determination with the MSJ Order, the Court extends the same declaratory relief granted to Petitioners to the Bond Eligible Class as a whole.”

This linkage between the summary judgment ruling and the class certification order means that the declaratory judgment is now binding for all class members nationwide.

Key Holding

The court’s combined orders establish the following principle:

Class members are detained under INA § 236—not INA § 235(b)(2)(A)—and therefore are legally entitled to consideration for release on bond.

This represents a significant shift away from the now-rejected framework of Matter of Yajure Hurtado, which had treated virtually all noncitizens who entered without inspection as subject to mandatory detention without bond under § 235(b)(2)(A), regardless of the circumstances of their apprehension.

The Nationwide Bond Eligible Class

The court certified the following class:

All noncitizens in the United States without lawful status who:

(1) have entered or will enter the United States without inspection;

(2) were not or will not be apprehended upon arrival; and

(3) are not or will not be subject to detention under

• 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) (mandatory criminal detention),

• 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (expedited removal), or

• 8 U.S.C. § 1231 (post-final-order detention)

at the time DHS makes the initial custody determination.

Because the class is nationwide, DHS and ICE must now treat individuals meeting this definition as eligible for bond hearings, unless a separate statutory mandatory-detention ground applies.

Impact

This litigation represents one of the most consequential detention-authority decisions in years. Its effects include:

• Immediate bond eligibility for thousands of noncitizens who previously were deemed mandatorily detained under § 235(b)(2)(A).

• Uniform nationwide standards on how DHS must classify such individuals when making initial custody determinations.

• Significant constraints on ICE practices that had expanded § 235 detention far beyond its text and purpose.

• A likely increase in bond redetermination hearings before immigration judges across the country.

Government appeal is possible, but unless and until a higher court stays or overturns the orders, DHS is legally bound to comply.

In a rare interview about what she views as an existential threat to the integrity of democratic institutions, Chief U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall told the ABC7 Chicago I-Team the number of threats directed toward federal judges has increased year-by-year.

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

""I've personally seen with my own judges on the bench, that number of threats increased significantly,"" Judge Kendall told the I-Team. ""The whole concept of our entire democracy is based on the three branches of government, and one branch has to be independent of each other branch. Judges have to be able to not be swayed by public opinion, be swayed by money, be swayed by reputation, they have to be able to do the job and apply the laws.""

The number of threats to judges nationwide has increased by 40% in the last four years, according to data from the U.S. Marshals Service.

In Chicago, federal judges for the Northern District of Illinois are also seeing an acute rise in threats over many cases related to recent immigration enforcement operations.

Sources confirmed with the I-Team that at least five federal judges representing high-profile cases have received some form of threats, including District Judge April Perry, who is overseeing a case about the National Guard's deployment in Illinois; District Judge Sara Ellis, who is presiding over a case involving federal immigration agents' use of force; District Judge LaShonda Hunt, who issued a ruling on fencing outside of the Broadview U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility; District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who is presiding over litigation involving a warrantless arrest consent decree; and Magistrate Judge Laura McNally, who is overseeing litigation over conditions inside the Broadview ICE facility.

When asked about these threats, Kendall told the I-Team, ""No question. I don't think it matters which side they would have ruled. That's the climate that we're in.""

""If you rule for or against a particular issue, it seems to be fair game for this kind of reactive behavior on the part of the public. And mind you, it's not all of the public. We have tremendous support. ... But it doesn't matter when it's pitted up against this group of individuals that choose to use this language, choose to use these attacks to spread derogatory information about individual human beings,"" Kendall said.

The Federal Bar Association's Chicago chapter recently condemned the rise in threats to judges in the Northern District of Illinois and across the country.

""Expressions of public sentiment-whether criticism or praise-are not threats to judicial independence,"" the FBA Chicago chapter statement reads. ""Recent threats of violence directed at Chicago federal judges for simply doing their job, however, are unacceptable and have no place in our discourse.""

In response to rulings in several local immigration-related cases, officials with the Trump administration have called out ""activist judges"" as responsible for rulings it deems not in the administration's favor.

Judge Kendall said the entire bench rules impartially.

""Each of the judges on this bench, they don't go out to be political,"" Judge Kendall said. ""They go out saying, 'I've got my law degree, I've got my oath from the President. It's now time for me to listen to evidence, listen to facts, apply the law and come to a fair and impartial decision.'""

But with the rise of social media, and access to personal information online, Judge Kendall says intimidation has increased, especially in recent months.

Clerk of Court for the Northern District of Illinois Thomas Bruton said he has seen this first-hand.

""We have seen threats significantly increase,"" Bruton said. ""We've seen threats increase both online, through email communication, through phone communication, and it's concerning.""

Bruton added, ""It's a difficult job when you look at the statistics and the number of judges that have been threatened, you look at the number of staff that have received inappropriate communications. But it's our job to keep everyone safe.""

Geoffrey Deas is the assistant director of judicial security for the U.S. Marshals Service. Deas told the I-Team he is particularly concerned with ""silent hunters,"" or people who may not have made any active threat but are triggered to action by violent rhetoric.

Deas explained the U.S. Marshals Service evaluates any communications sent to district judges, and if the communication goes beyond ""First Amendment Protected Speech,"" the U.S. Marshals, along with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, has statutory power to investigate further.

In 2025, Deas said 364 different judges out of approximately 2,500 active judges nationwide were named as threatened on a protective investigation.

Deas said he expects to see an uptick in threats to judges locally because of the intensity surrounding recent immigration-related rulings.

Judge Kendall worries the threats could have long-term consequences.

""It's really critical that you can seek redress in the federal court,"" Judge Kendall said. ""The public really needs to understand how serious it is for the independence of the judiciary because judges just need to be able to do their job. ... If they're disagreed with, then there's a higher court. But in order to do that, well, we have to be able to just honestly do our jobs without that nervousness of threats.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18210633_112525-wls-iteam-judges-mark-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-26 02:56:54.967750

By Force of Habit: How the Use of Force in Immigration Detention Has Lost Sight of Necessity and Dignity was published by the Independent Monitoring Boards (IMB), which examines conditions in prisons and immigration detention centres. The findings revealed force being applied inconsistently, disproportionately, and without adequate justification, which it said undermined the dignity and welfare of highly vulnerable individuals.

It highlighted how routine handcuffing, particularly during hospital transfers, appeared to have become the default rather than the exception. In one case, a frail 70-year-old man was handcuffed despite paperwork noting no evidence of risk. The report describes the practice of only allowing detainees to be taken to hospital if they were handcuffed as “a form of coercion”.

The report comes at a time when the government has pledged to expand immigration detention so it can deport more people.

The IMB national chair, Elisabeth Davies, said: “It’s about operational force being used for operational convenience.” She added that she has written to the Home Office “numerous times” raising concerns about the high levels of handcuffing and the lack of clear justification provided.

The report provided examples of restraint IMB is concerned about, including a man who was on constant suicide watch who was screaming and resisting removal. He took off his trousers and was carried naked from the waist down to a plane. Staff took turns to push his head against his seat. The report found the impact on his dignity to be “profound”.

It also reprinted a note on a detention centre staff whiteboard saying: “Thought of the Day: Handle Stressful situations like a dog. If you can’t eat it or hump it, piss on it or walk away.”

Davies said the sign was not hidden in any way. She has called for changes in staff culture and said the sign was an example of staff culture: “I think that offers little reassurance.”

Another example of a concerning staff culture highlighted by the report involved an incident where a personal protection trainer told officers: “If someone’s coming at me, I’m going to keep myself safe. I don’t worry about what’s proportionate, I won’t worry about Serco or my job, my priority is to look after myself.”

A spokesperson for the government contractor Serco, one of the private contractors used by the Home Office to manage detention centres, said: “This report is full of unevidenced assertions and unsubstantiated comments which do not reflect our professional training or how we treat people in our care. Our officers only use appropriate and proportionate force as a last resort, and the use of force is closely monitored.”

Missed opportunities for de-escalation are also identified in the report, including a case where a man was restrained after failing to obey an instruction to stand up. The report finds no evidence of a trauma-informed approach, despite many detained people having experienced trauma, including torture and trafficking, with nothing to indicate that this was being considered when planning or executing force interventions.

Significant gaps were identified in the recording of force with incomplete documentation, inaccurate records, and ineffective review processes identified, raising concerns about governance and accountability.

Davies added: “The findings of this report are deeply concerning. For the use of force to be lawful, it must be necessary, reasonable, proportionate and justifiable, but what we are seeing is a system where restraint has become routine, oversight is weak, and the dignity of detained individuals is too often disregarded.

“We need meaningful cultural change and robust accountability to protect the rights of highly vulnerable people in detention. As national chair, I call on the Home Office to act urgently to strengthen oversight, embed trauma-informed practices, and ensure that force is only used when absolutely necessary.”

A spokesperson for Medical Justice, which supports the health of people in immigration detention, said: “The findings of this report are distressing. The Home Office continues to preside over the dangerous use of force and restraints demonstrating an inexcusable disregard for the safety of vulnerable people in its care.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Last week, the home secretary announced the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times, which will make it easier to remove and deport migrants. As part of this, we are reforming human rights laws and replacing the broken appeals system.

“We will carefully consider the findings in the report. The Home Office reviews all incidents of use of force to ensure that techniques are used proportionately.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8856c9942c673266266a38d1adec3b60fb6af5f8/1173_339_3327_2661/master/3327.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=536c839768501141464f5acddf086b66",N,,2025-11-25 20:57:31.380244

ICE arrested Dias Goncalves in June after a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled her over in Fruita and asked about her accent and immigration status.
After a warrantless arrest, immigration officers now must document evidence of a person’s flight risk, including only evidence that they were aware of before making the arrest.
And a plaintiff identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R.
In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ conduct during arrests in Colorado has been “unlawful,” a federal judge ruled Tuesday in an order that restricts how immigration officers can arrest people in the state.

The preliminary injunction ruling is a significant victory for immigrants rights groups, who sued ICE last month to stop “indiscriminate” arrests and detentions. The lawsuit alleges that ICE agents are arresting and detaining people in Colorado because of their skin color, accent or perceived nationality, without determining flight risk, to fulfill arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

ICE must repay the bond money posted by three named plaintiffs in the case, all immigrants arrested in Colorado, remove their ankle monitors and stop making warrantless arrests in the state without determining and documenting each person’s flight risk, according to the the ruling by U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver.

“ICE’s hubris and violent behavior have been on national display for months,” said Hans Meyer, owner of the Meyer Law Office and an immigration attorney for the plaintiffs. “But as Judge Jackson’s decision makes clear, no one — including ICE — is above the law.”

The Meyer Law Office filed the suit along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray LLC.

ICE’s Denver field office referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ruling could force ICE to curb its arrests of bystanders in targeted operations or its use of large sweeps of apartment buildings and workplaces, where officers do not know the identities of all of the people they are arresting before they arrive.

The law firms sued ICE on behalf of four people, including Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah student who was brought to the U.S. as a child. ICE arrested Dias Goncalves in June after a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled her over in Fruita and asked about her accent and immigration status. She spent 15 days in ICE’s Aurora detention center and paid $2,000 for her bond, according to the ACLU.

U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver ruled that Dias Goncalves and two of the other plaintiffs now represent a class that includes all people arrested since Jan. 20, 2025, and people who will be arrested by immigration officers in Colorado “without a warrant and without a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk.”

Jackson ruled that ICE’s behavior of making warrantless arrests without probable cause that the people arrested are flight risks is “part of a larger policy, pattern, or practice by ICE in this state.”

Jackson ordered immigration officers to stop making warrantless arrests in Colorado unless the arresting officer determines before the arrest that there is probable cause that the person is in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws and there is probable cause that the person will escape before a warrant can be obtained.

After a warrantless arrest, immigration officers now must document evidence of a person’s flight risk, including only evidence that they were aware of before making the arrest. That documentation will have to include evidence of a person’s ties to the community that weigh against flight risk.

ICE will have to provide the lawyers representing the plaintiffs a random set of these probable cause forms for their review regularly, the order said, and specific forms upon request.

In addition to repaying three of the plaintiffs’ bonds and removing their ankle monitors, ICE must rescind any reporting requirements for them. ICE also is barred from rearresting the plaintiffs without a judicial warrant, according to the order, and is not allowed to detain them again unless there is a “material change in circumstances.”

In his ruling, Jackson said the plaintiffs in the case have likely suffered irreparable harm due to ICE’s actions.

“Although none of them presented a flight risk by any reasonable measure, they were each arrested and detained without warning, ultimately spending between approximately two weeks and three months in custody,” Jackson’s order said. “On its own, this constitutes great harm.”

A plaintiff identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. is a 36-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado for 15 years. On Feb. 5, ICE agents raided the Whispering Pines Apartments complex in Aurora, where he had lived for seven years. ICE agents arrested J.S.T. as he was leaving the apartment parking lot to drive to his job at a restaurant and grocery store. He spent four weeks at the Aurora detention center and lost his home as a result, according to the lawsuit. He paid $25,000 for his bond, according to the ACLU.

And a plaintiff identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. is a 32-year-old father and construction business owner who has lived in the U.S. for 11 years. In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R. was waiting as a designated driver for a friend. G.R.R. spent seven weeks at the Aurora detention center, according to the lawsuit. He paid $10,000 for his bond, according to the ACLU.

A fourth plaintiff, Refugio Ramirez Ovando, is a 43-year-old father who has lived in Colorado for 20 years and is the father of four U.S. citizen children. ICE agents in unmarked cars pulled him over in May when he was on his way to work in Grand Junction at the construction concrete company where he has worked for 18 years. ICE held him at the detention center in Aurora for more than 90 days, according to the lawsuit.

Jackson, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama in 2011, found that Ramirez Ovando doesn’t have standing in the case because he has obtained legal permanent residency and is unlikely to suffer similar ongoing harms like the rest of the plaintiffs.

Citing testimony in the case last month from the third in command at ICE’s Denver field office, Greg Davies, Jackson said the court has reason to believe ICE has a pattern or practice of failing to assess people’s individual flight risks. Davis “could not seemingly recall the correct standard, stating, at one point, that he believed a warrantless arrest was authorized if ‘there’s a possibility of that person possibly escaping.’”

Meyer, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said he and the legal team are exploring what possible remedies might be available to people already arrested without warrants under similar circumstances in Colorado who could be considered part of the new class.

The preliminary injunction, he said, should be seen as a first step toward accountability for ICE’s actions. Meyer cautioned that ICE has chosen not to comply with court orders elsewhere.

“Coming right before Thanksgiving when people get to congregate with their families, this is a powerful decision that reinforces the fact that ICE has been terrorizing communities throughout Colorado and breaking federal law with impunity,” he said. “Our expectation is that ICE will now be held to account for its lawlessness by the courts.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Colo_Sun_Vizguerra_ICE_02-copy.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 20:57:40.103279

The government rejoins that petitioner was detained under §1225(b)(1) under which detention is mandatory.

“The government is correct. Petitioner offers no support for his contention that the statutory authority shifted to §1226(a) and nothing in the statutory scheme indicates that an alien in §1229 proceedings is to be detained under §1226. …

“To the extent petitioner argues that his parole after arrival placed him under §1226(a) rather than §1225(b), he is mistaken. …

“Having established that §1225(b) (1) is the applicable statute, the next question is whether petitioner has been afforded the statutory rights to which he is entitled. It is clear that he has. …

“Petitioner, relying on case law, also claims that his detention without a bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause. … That argument is, however, premised on his incorrect assertion that he is subject to §1226.

“Because of the entry fiction doctrine, mandatory detention of petitioner under §1225 does not deprive him of due process or run afoul of the Constitution.

Oregon joined 21 other Democratic-led states in August to sue the federal government for threatening to withhold $1.4 billion in federal Victims of Crime Act funding unless the states agreed to help with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit never went to trial because the Trump administration abandoned its plan after the suit was filed, allowing states to retain federal grants without any new immigration enforcement rules.

The Oregon Department of Justice has spent at least $19,000 in legal fees and travel expenses this year to send employees to attend court hearings in Washington D.C. and New York, according to public records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. Meanwhile, by filing the lawsuits the state has kept about $4.5 billion meant for Oregon Health and Science University research, electric vehicle infrastructure, sexual health education programs and education programs supporting low-income and unhoused students.

The lawsuits are to ensure Oregonians aren’t left paying the price when the federal government oversteps or breaks the law, Hansson said.

“The Oregon Department of Justice is committed to protecting Oregonians — not wasting their money,” Hansson told the Capital Chronicle. “The resources we’ve invested in defending Oregon’s rights in court are a fraction of what’s at stake.”

Oregon’s federal litigation team isn’t funded with direct taxpayer dollars

Some states set aside millions for potential lawsuits against the Trump administration. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom in late 2024 convened a special session to set aside $25 million to pay for anticipated legal costs against the Trump administration. In Maryland, Attorney General Anthony Brown received $1 million from the governor to fund a federal litigation team, Maryland Matters reported.

The state of Oregon did something similar, allocating $8.2 million in its 2025-27 Department of Justice’s budget to fund 20 full-time positions to support civil litigation and for the “defense of state interests.”

What’s unique about Oregon is that the money going toward defending state interests isn’t coming from the state general fund — or money collected from personal or corporate income taxes — but rather it’s coming from proceeds from civil litigation when the state is awarded damages, according to legislative fiscal analyst Steve Robbins.

With this designated funding, the department created a federal litigation team to respond to national legal issues. An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.

In total, Oregon’s Department of Justice’s budget increased by 4% from the previous two-year cycle, raising its budget to $1 billion.

Some of that new funding also includes $17 million to support child advocacy centers and support services for domestic and sexual violence victims, $13 million to replace some of its legal software, $8.8 million to upgrade its child support software system and $10.8 million to add 33 full-time attorneys in its trial division to reduce the state’s need to contract with more expensive, private firms.

The growth in detainees has put additional pressure on the Nevada Southern Detention Center, already one of the most over-capacity ICE detention centers in the country.","The number of detainees at Nevada’s three main immigration detention centers has grown by more than 30 percent since September, according to the most recent data released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

ICE is holding 554 people per day in its two Southern Nevada detention centers, data released Nov. 20 revealed. The Nevada Southern Detention Center in Pahrump is holding 461 people compared with the 365 individuals it held as of Sept. 25, the last time ICE released data. The Henderson Detention Center holds 93 ICE detainees per day, compared with 78 in September.

In Washoe County, the changes are more dramatic. Since September, the number of ICE detainees at the Washoe County Jail has jumped from 16 to 46 people per day — an increase of nearly 200 percent.

The new numbers come as ICE eyes creating a new detention facility in Nevada while the state struggles to meet capacity. At a press conference this weekend, Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem hinted at the possibility of expanding space in the state and, according to reporting from The Washington Post, the department is looking into constructing a “soft-side” facility — a makeshift structure composed of tents — at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.

Such a facility would double detention capacity in Nevada, adding space for about 450 people, per documents obtained by The Washington Post.

“We have some conversations that are ongoing — but I can't speak directly to details that are being finalized,” Noem told an Indy reporter at the press conference at Harry Reid International Airport.

The growth in detainees has put additional pressure on the Nevada Southern Detention Center, already one of the most over-capacity ICE detention centers in the country. The facility — which has a capacity of more than 1,000 and also holds detainees for other federal agencies — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day, but it is now exceeding that limit by more than 210 people.

Officials have previously raised concerns about adequate access to medical care and legal representation at the facility.

Changes to accommodate increasing ICE demands are already underway in Northern Nevada. In August, Washoe County had a $430,000 federal grant approved by the state to make improvements to the county jail, including dedicated holding cells and office space for ICE — although the sheriff's office wrote online that it was not planning to expand capacity with the funding.

Rising arrests?

Despite the dramatic increase in ICE detainees, it is harder to track down data about the number of immigration arrests in the state as most arrest data is not typically broken down on a local scale.

It is not uncommon for ICE detainees to be transferred from facility to facility prior to deportation, meaning that the number of those detained does not precisely indicate the number arrested. Recent Los Angeles Times reporting found that 12 percent of those detained from January through July 2025 have been transferred at least four times.

Still, the most recent information does signal that arrests are on the rise. An Indy analysis from this summer found that through the end of this June, ICE arrested about 48 people in Nevada weekly, more than four times the weekly average in the final 16 months of President Joe Biden’s administration.

Information from that data set, which derives from public records, has not been updated since July.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/07/042ca30f-ap25198625261415.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 20:57:43.630407

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.","McALLEN — Yaakub Vijandre was preparing to go to work as a mechanic when six vehicles appeared outside his Dallas-area home. Federal agents jumped out, one pointed a weapon at him, and they took him into custody.

Vijandre is a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people from deportation since 2012 if they were brought to the United States as children and generally stayed out of trouble. The Trump administration said it targeted Vijandre over social media posts. The freelance videographer and pro-Palestinian activist described his early October arrest to his attorneys, who relayed the information to reporters.

His arrest and several others this year signal a change in how the U.S. is handling DACA recipients as President Donald Trump’s administration reshapes immigration policy more broadly. The change comes as immigrants have face increased vetting, including of their social media, when they apply for visas, green cards, citizenship, or to request the release of their children from federal custody. The administration also has sought to deport foreign students for participating in pro-Palestinian activism.

DACA was created to shield recipients, commonly referred to as “Dreamers,” from immigration arrests and deportation. It also allows them to legally work in the U.S. Recipients reapply every two years. Previously if their status was in jeopardy, they would receive a warning and would still have a chance to fight it before immigration officers detained them and began efforts to deport them.

In response to questions about any changes, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement saying that people “who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportations. DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” DACA recipients can lose status “for a number of reasons, including if they’ve committed a crime,” she said.

McLaughlin also claimed in a statement that Vijandre made social media posts “glorifying terrorism,” including one she said celebrated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida’s leader in Iraq who was killed in a U.S. strike in 2006.

An attorney for Vijandre, Chris Godshall-Bennett, said Vijandre’s social media activity is “clearly” protected speech. He also said the government has not provided details about the specific posts in court documents.

Vijandre is among about 20 DACA recipients who have been arrested or detained by immigration authorities since Trump took office in January, according to Home is Here, a campaign created by pro-DACA advocacy groups. The administration is seeking to end his DACA status, which could result in him being deported to the Philippines, a home he has not visited since his family came to the U.S. in 2001, when he was 14.

DACA has faced legal challenges

DACA survived the first Trump administration’s attempt to rescind the program when the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the administration did not take the proper steps to end it.

There have been other attempts to end the program or place restrictions on recipients.

This year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that would deny work permits for DACA recipients who live in Texas. The Trump administration recently presented its plans to a federal judge who is determining how it will work.

The administration also has issued new restrictions on commercial driver’s licenses that would prevent DACA recipients and some other immigrants from getting them. Last year, 19 Republican states stripped DACA recipients’ access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. And the number of states where immigrant students can qualify for in-state tuition has dwindled since the Justice Department began suing states this year.

“This administration might not be trying to end DACA altogether the way that they did the first time around, but they are chipping away at it,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, spokesperson for United We Dream, which is part of Home is Here, the coalition keeping track of public cases of DACA recipients who have been detained.

Detained DACA recipients question their arrests

Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago Santiago, a 28-year-old activist from El Paso, was arrested in August despite showing immigration officers a valid work permit obtained through DACA.

Days later, federal officers arrested Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira as the 28-year-old father was arriving at his El Paso home with his children following a doctor’s appointment. Agents dislocated his shoulder, according to his attorneys.

Both Santiago and Gamez Lira were held for over a month while their attorneys petitioned for their release.

Marisa Ong, an attorney for Santiago and Gamez Lira, said the government failed to notify either of her clients of any intention to terminate their DACA status.

“DACA recipients have a constitutionally protected interest in their continued liberty,” Ong said, adding that “the government cannot take away that liberty without providing some valid reason.”

DACA recipients can lose their status if they are convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanors like those involving harming others, driving under the influence or drug distribution, or three or more misdemeanors. They can also lose their status if they pose a threat to national security or public safety.

DHS claimed in a statement that Santiago was previously charged with trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia and that Gamez Lira was previously arrested for marijuana possession.

Ong said that when attorneys sought their release “the government presented no evidence of any past misconduct by either individual.”

Vijandre, the Dallas-area man who was arrested in October, remains in a Georgia detention facility. His attorneys say he received notice two weeks before his arrest that the government planned to terminate his DACA status but that he wasn’t given a chance to fight it.

“I think that the administration has drawn a very clear line and at least for right now, between citizen and noncitizens, and their goal is to remove as many noncitizens from the country as possible and to make it as difficult as possible for noncitizens to enter the country,” Godshall-Bennett, Vijandre’s attorney, said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DACA-Rally-REUTERS.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:43.396754

The Cambodian government has long failed to ensure an adequate standard of living, compelling many families to obtain predatory microfinance loans, making the tenuous situation of people who returned even more difficult.

The government should follow through on its pledges to find jobs for those who returned and implement more effective measures to protect all Cambodians from predatory debt collection practices.

(Bangkok) – The Cambodian government is failing to provide support to hundreds of thousands of migrant workers with microfinance debts who returned from Thailand because of hostilities in mid-2025, Human Rights Watch said today.

Even before the border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, from July 24-28, Cambodian officials encouraged migrant workers in Thailand to return home because of rising tensions, and more than 900,000 have done so. The government’s promises of jobs and other support have not materialized for most though, and many are under pressure to repay microfinance loans they took before seeking work in Thailand. The government should assist returned migrant workers to find jobs in Cambodia and adopt measures to provide meaningful debt relief to them and other Cambodians.

“The Cambodian government has an obligation to assist the migrant workers its officials encouraged to return from Thailand because of discrimination and recent hostilities,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should ensure that predatory microfinance institutions are not putting improper pressure on returned migrants and other marginalized Cambodians who are struggling to feed their families.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 56 former migrant workers in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province who returned from Thailand between May and September.

The Cambodian government has long failed to ensure the rights to an adequate standard of living, education, and health care, compelling many families to obtain predatory microfinance loans. The return of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian migrant workers because of hostilities with Thailand and the promises of support from the Cambodian government have made their already tenuous situation even more difficult, Human Rights Watch said.

In May, tensions escalated at the Thai-Cambodia border. On June 14, Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen called on all Cambodians working in Thailand to return home to avoid expulsion or mistreatment in Thailand, calling it a “real and inevitable risk.” Prime Minister Hun Manet, Hun Sen’s son, said the government was prepared to facilitate repatriation, with the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training pledging more than 70,000 jobs for returned migrants and the Ministry of Economy and Finance ready to offer a “range of economic and social intervention packages aimed at improving their daily lives.”

On June 23, Thailand ordered the closure of all land crossings with Cambodia, except for migrant workers returning to Cambodia.

Migrant workers told Human Rights Watch that they returned to Cambodia due to discrimination and harassment in Thailand, as well as the Cambodian government’s promises of employment and social assistance. But many said that once back in Cambodia, they have been skipping meals and forgoing medical care to make repayments on microfinance loans they incurred before going abroad. In 2023, the average Cambodian household held more debt than they spent for the year.

A 17-year-old who had worked for two years in Thailand said she had dropped out of school and migrated to help her mother repay a microfinance loan. She said that after fighting between Thailand and Cambodia began, her Thai employers would regularly verbally harass her: “I would cry every day because of the bad treatment at work.”

Despite government promises, returned migrant workers said that there were very few jobs available once they got back home. Some travelled to find work in the capital, Phnom Penh, hundreds of kilometers away from their homes in provinces along the Thai-Cambodia border, but few reportedly found employment.

A 32-year-old woman who tried to get a job at a Cambodian garment factory after returning from Thailand said she did not have the necessary experience. “I took a three-day skills test, and I didn’t pass because I didn’t have the skills to work and sew the garments,” she said. “They want skilled workers, and we don’t have the skills.”

Many returned migrants have loans from banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs). For years, Cambodian banks and MFIs have engaged in predatory lending, causing a household debt crisis, and pressure to repay debts often contributes to the decision to migrate to Thailand for work. Cambodia has the most microcredit debt per capita anywhere in the world.

A 2019 report from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) identified microfinance debt as a growing driver of migration from Cambodia, and Cambodia’s microfinance sector has grown rapidly since then. The Cambodian Development Resource Institute (CDRI) reported that one-third of returned migrant workers are from households that hold formal loans ranging from US$5,000 to US$8,000, several times larger than Cambodia’s annual median per-capita income.

A 41-year-old woman who had lived in Thailand for 10 years working in construction in Bangkok said that she now had to balance repaying her loans with paying for health care and her children’s education. “We have to decide between food, making MFI payments, and whether our kids can still afford to go to school,” she said. Her household used to have three people working in Thailand but now all have returned, and the family has cut back to two meals a day. She said that if they miss their monthly loan repayment of more than $100, they will lose the land they pledged as collateral for the loan.

Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Cambodia is a party, governments are obligated to take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to progressively realize the human right to an adequate standard of living. This includes the obligation to protect people from conduct by third parties, such as predatory microfinance institutions, that would prevent the fulfillment of this right. Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, private companies also have responsibilities to respect human rights and to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for practices that have harmed people.

The Cambodian government should take prompt action to uphold the rights of returned migrant workers, including by following through on its pledges to assist them in finding employment. The government should also implement more effective measures to protect all Cambodians, including returned migrant workers, from predatory debt collection practices and the potential human rights harms of debt servicing.

This could include the restructuring of loans for returned migrant workers and others affected by the Thai-Cambodia border conflict, who face extreme economic hardship. The government needs to enforce penalties for aggressive debt collection practices and ensure that all microfinance institutions and lenders follow ethical standards for loan recovery.

The government also needs to address the broader situation that compels many families in Cambodia to take on considerable debt, including by removing barriers to health care and free education. The Cambodian government should allocate appropriate resources to both sectors and set budgetary spending targets aligned with international benchmarks.

“The situation is dire for these returned migrant workers, who are rapidly eroding their savings to survive and pay off their debts,” Lau said. “Cambodian authorities need to act swiftly to protect Cambodians from microfinance lenders and financial institutions and support workers who returned from Thailand at their urging.”

Fear of Violence, Discrimination Drove Migrant Workers to Return

Many migrant workers told Human Rights Watch that they returned to Cambodia because they experienced or feared discrimination in Thailand, or feared violence, as tensions rose at the border.

A woman, 44, who had worked in Thailand for more than 20 years, said that after the border conflict began on July 24, everyday life in Thailand became more difficult. She recalled being told, “Why don’t you go back to Cambodia and pick up the bones of the dead Cambodians?”

“My husband and I could not handle the discrimination, so we returned,” she said. “People in the market didn’t want to sell us food because we are Cambodian. Every time we went to work, we felt this discrimination.”

A man, 30, who had worked in Thailand for 10 years reported witnessing violence against Cambodian migrant workers. “A group of Thai men, around 50, were on foot and motorbikes looking for Khmer to attack,” he said. “One of the people in my village was also beaten and chased [until] I was about 10 meters away. The couple wanted help but there were so many Thais beating them, no one dared to help.”

Thai media reported several assaults on Cambodian workers, as well as social media posts of a Thai ultra-royalist activist talking about Cambodian workers who were ungrateful and taking jobs from Thai citizens.

Returned migrants said that Thai police and authorities also discriminated against Cambodian workers. A woman, 37, who worked in construction in Bangkok said that Thai police would ask migrant workers, “Do you want to go home to Cambodia, or do you all want to go to prison together?”

A man, 18, who also worked in construction in the Thai capital, recalled Thai police going door-to-door to check visas and passports of Cambodian migrant workers, asking for money or detaining people who could not pay. Some migrant workers reported being required to pay bribes to Thai police or soldiers when they crossed back into Cambodia.

The border between Cambodia and Thailand has remained shut, and many workers fear a return to Thailand would mean further discrimination or even violence from Thai authorities or employers. Thai media reported that about 300 Cambodian migrant workers were arrested between mid-June and September for attempting to cross into Thailand without permission. Other Cambodian migrant workers have reported staying in Thailand despite the situation due to the economic pressures stemming from loans, including bank and microfinance loans from Cambodian financial institutions.

After border tensions again increased in early November, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on November 10 announced the suspension of a policy that allows about 100,000 migrant workers from Cambodia to stay in Thailand for an additional year after their work permits expire. This has left the legal status of Cambodian migrant workers remaining in Thailand in limbo.

Promises of Jobs Unmet

Some migrant workers said that Cambodian government promises of jobs and social assistance also encouraged them to return home. On June 14, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet posted on his Facebook page that the government was ready to handle a mass repatriation of workers, and specifically mentioned that the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training would help find jobs for returned migrants due to a shortage of tens of thousands of workers in the country.

Upon returning to Cambodia, many migrants found that there were few jobs available, and those that did exist were either too far from their homes or a poor match for their skills. A woman, 53, returned to Cambodia due to fears of violence and because she read news reports that the Cambodian government had jobs for returning migrant workers. “But when we returned, there were no jobs for us,” she said.

A man, 28, said that getting hired at a garment factory in Cambodia was difficult because the jobs were far away, and returned migrant workers often lacked any connections that could help them secure employment. Others reported that the costs of transportation and housing in Phnom Penh and the length of time it would most likely take to find a job would make it too expensive for many returned migrants to seek employment in the capital.

The CDRI reported that the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training claimed there were 190,000 jobs available for returned migrant workers. Even if true, with more than 900,000 migrant workers returning, more than 700,000 workers would not be covered.

The CDRI further noted a mismatch between the available jobs and returned workers, with the majority of migrants returning to border provinces, such as Banteay Meanchey and Battambang, while most of the available jobs were in Phnom Penh. In addition, more than half of returned migrant workers had been working in construction or agriculture in Thailand, while most of the available jobs in Cambodia were in other sectors.

In October, a group of local civil society organizations called on the government to address these issues through improved social security, especially unemployment benefits, large-scale and gender-sensitive employment programs, and debt relief, among other measures.

International human rights law provides everyone the right to social security, including during periods of unemployment. Currently, nobody who is unemployed in Cambodia has access to social security, based on the International Labour Organization’s data.

Debt Pressures

As Human Rights Watch has previously reported, Cambodian households often take out loans from paying supplementary school fees to affording out-of-pocket payments for essential medicines, and other human rights. But when household income must be diverted to service debt, it can also limit the fulfillment of rights like health, education, and an adequate standard of living, which includes the rights to food, housing, and water.

Like other Cambodians living in rural areas or in poverty, many returned migrant workers are in significant debt to microfinance institutions for loans they took out years ago.

While the Cambodian government has adopted laws and policies to regulate MFIs, they remain largely unenforced, allowing predatory lending and collection practices to persist.

In correspondence with Human Rights Watch from July, the National Bank of Cambodia, which has the authority to sanction and suspend or revoke licenses of MFIs, did not provide any instances in which it had penalized or sanctioned MFIs for any violation of consumer protection or regulatory laws or policies. Rather, the government has repeatedly demonstrated a preference for voluntary measures and self-regulation.

On July 30, the National Bank of Cambodia issued new guidelines to financial institutions that “encouraged” them to enact unspecified “relief” for returned migrant workers. None of the people interviewed identified any meaningful relief measures by microfinance institutions or banks.

A woman, 18, who was until recently working at an agricultural factory in Thailand said she moved abroad after dropping out of school in grade 9 because her family had to sell the motorbike that she was using to ride to school to repay their microfinance loans. She said that since returning to Cambodia in July, she eats about half as much meat as she used to at each meal and is worried about not being able to pay for treatment for her mother’s medical condition.

A woman, 35, who used to work on a farm in Thailand before the fighting began, took a microfinance loan to build a home, but now struggles to juggle repayments along with food and medical costs. “I have to cut down on my food a lot ... we are replacing meat and protein with more rice now,” she said. “Credit officers come to my home to pressure me to make payments.… I am afraid they will take my land. We are afraid of the MFIs more than we are of the police.”

A woman, 47, who has both microfinance debt and informal loans, expressed fears about repaying her debts: “I’m willing to go without eating to pay back my loans out of fear of losing my land that my home is on.”

These pressures have led returned migrant workers to take on more debt to make ends meet and avoid forced land sales, a common practice of credit officers who pressure borrowers to sell their land without using the legal foreclosure method when they are unable to repay their loans. A man, 55, with a microfinance loan who had pledged his land as collateral, said: “When I am late on repayments, I walk around my village looking to borrow money from people out of fear of losing my land and my home on it ... I worry every day about my microfinance loan repayments; I worry all the time. Whatever I have I will sell, because I am worried about them taking my land.”

Healthcare costs put over-indebted households under further financial strain, with 61 percent of all healthcare costs in Cambodia covered out-of-pocket, by far the highest percentage in the region and among the highest in the world.

A woman, 33, who had recently returned after working in Thailand for four years, said that she initially left Cambodia because she could not earn enough to repay a microfinance loan, which she needed partly to pay for treating her mother’s chronic illness.

“When we are late, credit officers will come and harass us to make payments, and we would avoid staying home to not have them pressure us,” she said. “There have been maybe three or four families in my village who have lost land because they didn’t pay MFI loans. The families who lost land had to go work in Thailand, but now we don’t know where they are, because they have nothing to come back to.”

Two former construction workers in Bangkok—a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman—had each taken out microfinance loans to cover healthcare expenses for family members, using land that their houses are on as collateral. They said they ate less than they did before returning from Thailand because they were worried about losing their land. “I repay because I’m worried that they [credit officers] will take my land away,” the woman said. “I see on Facebook that people have lost their land, so I stress about it.”

The Cambodian Government’s Inadequate Response

There are few options available for returned migrant workers who cannot find work and are burdened with heavy microfinance debt.

The Cambodian government should take prompt action to uphold the rights of returned migrant workers, including by following through on its pledges to assist them in finding employment. The government should also take additional measures to implement more effective consumer protection measures to protect all Cambodians, including returned migrant workers, from predatory debt collection practices and the potential human rights harms of debt servicing. This could include the restructuring of loans for returned migrant workers and others affected by the Thai-Cambodia border conflict, who face extreme economic hardship. The government needs to prohibit and enforce penalties for aggressive debt collection practices and ensure that all microfinance institutions and lenders follow ethical standards for loan recovery.

The government also needs to address the broader situation that compels many families in Cambodia to take on considerable debt, including by removing barriers to health care and free education.

NEWS THEN & NOW

Then:

Policy and attitudes toward immigration have changed throughout U.S. history, including toward those seeking safety from political repression or violence, known as refugees or asylum seekers. The first department of immigration in the U.S., known as the Bureau of Immigration, was founded in 1891.

Anti-immigrant sentiment would often target specific populations of immigrants. In the mid-1800s, before the Civil War, a political group called the ""Know-Nothings"" pushed back against Irish and German immigration. On the West Coast, the Gold Rush brought Chinese immigrants who were often met with discrimination. This discrimination led to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating for ten years and made obtaining citizenship close to impossible. Later, workers would have to seek special permits to be eligible for employment.

Anti-immigration laws peaked around World War I, including quota systems by country and other barriers such as literacy tests.

After World War II and the establishment of the United Nations, the U.S. began to accept more ""displaced persons"" under ""expedited admission"" or a simpler process for immigration. Formal laws governing asylum cases, or a category of refugees seeking protection from political persecution, were established in response partly to people displaced by the Vietnam War.

Now:

The Trump administration has begun to dismantle asylum in the United States, partly through executive order. According to one order signed early in Trump's second term, ""The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.""

As noted in this segment, many individuals seeking formal asylum protections in court are being arrested and deported shortly after judges dismiss their cases.

Lawyers from around the country are working together and organizing, to find legal strategies to free detained immigrants.

Monterey and Santa Cruz counties are at the center of a power struggle with the state over a key part of the clean energy transition—battery storage.

A congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday focused on what witnesses called the chilling effects of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Immigration Lawyers Get Help From Unlikely Allies In Fight To Free Clients

After the 2024 presidential election, Stacy Tolchin expected the next four years to be an uphill battle. The Pasadena-based immigration lawyer lived through the chaos from the first Trump term. She remembers family separation, the Muslim travel ban and attacks on refugee and asylum programs. Yet, Tolchin and other lawyers and advocates were still surprised at the speed and sophistication of the current administration’s mass deportation campaign.

“It’s really much worse than I even contemplated it would be at the beginning of the year,” she said. The Trump administration has stripped international students of their visas, deported people to one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and launched violent immigration sweeps in American cities.

Besides the public-facing tactics, the administration has also made a series of quiet legal maneuvers that have made it much more difficult for immigrants to fight deportation cases. These efforts include: Funneling people into fast-track deportation programs, making it harder for immigrants to hire lawyers and making it almost impossible for detainees to get out on bond.

But after being knocked on their heels in the early months of Trump’s new term, lawyers nationwide are now banding together and developing their own legal strategies. “We need warriors, we need people to help us in this fight,” Tolchin said. Chief among them are writ of habeas corpus petitions — federal lawsuits that challenge illegal and indefinite detentions. Collectively, they have filed more than 4,000 habeas petitions as last-ditch efforts to get their clients released from immigration detention centers.

Filing a habeas petition is unfamiliar for many attorneys. To help bridge the knowledge gap, immigration lawyers are turning to informal networks for help. Some organizations, like the American Immigration Lawyers Association, have even hosted formal workshops where lawyers can network and get a crash-course in filing habeas petitions.

Why Regulating Battery Energy Storage Is Taking So Long On The Central Coast

Santa Cruz County took a small step last week toward developing a policy to regulate battery energy storage systems (BESS).

At almost the same time, Monterey County supervisors were having a similar conversation. “We just can’t have somebody come in here while we don’t have an ordinance,” said District 2 Supervisor Glenn Church, during a Nov. 18 meeting. “We gotta develop an ordinance.”

The heart of the issue for both counties is the idea of local control. Currently, companies can apply with the state for permits to build and run a BESS. They don’t have to go through the county. But, if counties have ordinances governing BESS facilities, a company can instead choose to go the local route. That could mean more community support.

Here’s the challenge—the state’s climate goals demand a lot more renewable energy storage, fast. Local government is often slow. In Santa Cruz County, they were deciding whether to start a year-long process to develop an ordinance. Even that was delayed. In Monterey County, they were weighing whether to enact a temporary moratorium on new BESS facilities. That didn’t happen either.

Congressional Hearing Examines Effects Of Immigration Enforcement In Southern California

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, convened a congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday to gather testimony about alleged violations by federal immigration agents, whom they accuse of improperly detaining immigrants and citizens alike, often without probable cause or warrants.

The hearing included testimony from elected officials, experts and residents who have been directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Andrea Velez is a U.S. citizen who was detained by ICE agents while on her way to work in June. “Terrified, I used my work bag as a shield, but he slammed me into the sidewalk and accused me of interfering,” she said. “When I asked for his badge or a warrant, he refused and handcuffed me. They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID. I spent most of that first day shackled in a van watching others arrive, distraught and taken against their will.”

Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight also launched a new tracking system to document possible misconduct and abuse during federal immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/GettyImages-2216992166-2000x1334.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:50.926566

New Finance Committee Analysis Shows Historic Cuts To Health Care, Food Assistance, Education, And Child Welfare Programs

Text of the Report (PDF)

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today released a new analysis outlining the extensive harm the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are inflicting on millions of children nationwide. The report details how Republican actions are reducing access to health care, slashing food assistance, weakening education and child welfare systems, and advancing immigration policies that traumatize vulnerable families.

“Despite empty promises to the contrary, Trump’s agenda is going to leave kids in America sicker, hungrier and less safe,” Wyden said. “By making the largest cuts to health care and food assistance in the nation’s history, Donald Trump and Republicans have left children and their families poorer and worse off in ways that will be felt for generations.

The report explains how the Republican agenda has cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, threatening coverage for children who rely on them for affordable health care. The analysis highlights how children’s hospitals are expected to lose billions in funding and how families will face higher premiums, new bureaucratic hurdles, and a greater risk of losing coverage altogether. It also documents unprecedented cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and related nutrition supports, including reductions that will affect more than 16 million children.

The report builds on previous work by Wyden to expose how the Trump-Republican agenda is leaving America less healthy. Last month, Wyden revealed how Trump Administration policies and the reconciliation bill will harm Americans with cancer. Earlier this month, Wyden exposed how health care providers across the country are slashing jobs and closing their doors on account of the Republican cuts.",https://www.finance.senate.gov/themes/finance/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 21:56:54.372661

Rob Bonta sued the Trump administration Tuesday seeking to stop a federal policy change that advocates say could force 170,000 formerly homeless Americans back on the streets or into shelters.

The lawsuit focuses on a federal program known as Continuum of Care that sends money to local governments and nonprofits to fight homelessness.

This month, the Trump administration announced it was drastically cutting the amount of money the program will pay for rental subsidies in permanent housing and shifting those dollars to temporary housing and services instead.

With subsidies for permanent housing reduced, advocates say 170,000 people could return to homelessness. Locally, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority has warned 5,000 L.A. County households, containing 6,800 people, could be at risk of losing their homes, which would erase the small decline in homelessness reported this year.

“This [federal] program has proven to be effective at getting Americans off the streets, yet the Trump Administration is now attempting to illegally slash its funding,” Bonta said in a statement.

HUD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This month, the department said its policy change “restores accountability to homelessness programs and promotes self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans” in part by redirecting most money to transitional housing and supportive services that it sees as more effective than permanent housing.

Bonta filed the lawsuit along with 19 state attorneys general and two governors.

The lawsuit alleges the HUD policy change violated the law in several ways, including that the department failed to properly notice the change and that the new restrictions on funding violate the separation of powers because they were not imposed by Congress.

In addition to capping the amount of funds that can be spent on permanent housing, HUD is requiring more total homeless dollars be subject to competitive bidding.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6821813/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3411x1791+0+242/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F07%2F89%2F0b1c094c4051b0041a582c87bb2d%2Fcalifornia-bonta-26497.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 18:58:41.083177

The city’s immigrant communities are on alert and expressing anxiety about the expected arrival of U.S. Border Patrol agents. Federal officials have said little publicly about what is planned for New Orleans, though troops reportedly could arrive as early as Nov. 28 in preparation for raids to begin in early December.

On Nov. 22, Louisiana Bishop Shannon Duckworth issued a statement upholding the baptismal call to respect the dignity of every human being. The following is Duckworth’s full statement.

Beloved Sisters and Brothers,

Grace and peace to you in the name of the One who calls us to “do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with our God” (Micah 6:8).

In recent days, we have received notice of upcoming immigration enforcement actions that will take place across various Louisiana communities. As the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana, I am mindful of our responsibility both to uphold the dignity of every person and to support the common good of our cities and towns.

Louisiana is a state that values order, stability, and the rule of law. As a diocese, we affirm the need for lawful systems of immigration and the importance of public safety. We also affirm that the current system is broken and requires reform. At the same time, we ask that the exercise of governmental authority be proportional, humane, and respectful of constitutional protections. Law and order must never be divorced from justice, and justice must never be separated from mercy.

We therefore urge all enforcement personnel, public officials, and community leaders to conduct themselves with compassion; to avoid actions that separate families unnecessarily; to respect houses of worship, schools, and hospitals as sensitive locations; and to honor the inherent worth of every human being regardless of immigration status.

During this period of heightened anxiety, we ask Louisiana congregations and faith communities to commit themselves to prayer, hospitality, practical and lawful assistance, and responsible reporting.

To those living in fear during this time: You are not alone. Your lives have dignity. Your children matter. Your faith communities walk beside you. While we cannot prevent lawful enforcement actions, we can stand with you, spiritually, pastorally, and humanely, so that fear does not have the final word.

The God we worship is a God who “is near to the brokenhearted” (Psalm 34:18), and who calls nations to embody compassion. We pray that Louisiana may respond to these days not with panic, hostility, or division, but with courage, prudence, and neighborly love.

Faithfully,",https://i0.wp.com/episcopalnewsservice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ENS_placeholder_2024.jpg?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-25 22:56:30.152808

Karoline Leavitt declined to comment on the arrest.
Michael Leavitt won $1 million in a DraftKings contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt now has a family connection to the ICE actions sweeping the country — her nephew’s mother was arrested by agents in Revere earlier this month.

Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the U.S. from Brazil as a child, according to her sister and immigration authorities, is now in custody at an ICE facility in Louisiana.

Michael Leavitt, the press secretary's brother, had a relationship with Ferreira, and the two have a son.

A Trump administration official confirmed the connection between Ferreira, Michael Leavitt and his sister Karoline Leavitt — the 28-year-old New Hampshire native who rose from relative obscurity to occupy one of the most prominent positions in the White House. The official said the child's parents have not spoken in years, and that the child has lived full-time in New Hampshire with Michael Leavitt since his birth.

WBUR could not immediately confirm whether the boy only lived with his father after the couple separated. The split happened about 10 years ago, according to a family member.

Karoline Leavitt declined to comment on the arrest. The administration official said, “Karoline had no involvement whatsoever in this matter.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Ferreira had a ""previous arrest for battery."" She entered the U.S. on a tourist visa that required her to leave the U.S. in 1999, McLaughlin said.

“Under President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation,” McLaughlin said.

A lawyer for Ferreira was not immediately available for comment.

No battery charges against Bruna Ferreira could be located in Massachusetts' online court records.

Michael Leavitt won $1 million in a DraftKings contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. At the time, the story said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was 8 months old.

In a statement, Michael Leavitt said, “My only concern has always been the safety, wellbeing, and privacy of my son.”

Ferreira’s sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, started a GoFundMe page to help with legal costs to fight the ICE charges and allow her sister to stay in the country. According to the post, Ferreira has maintained her legal status through a program for people who entered the country as children — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She has “followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing,” according to the GoFundMe page.

“She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,"" Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote.

Why this is happening now The Trump administration says limits on graduate loans are needed to reduce tuition costs.
It believes that capping student loans will push universities charging higher-than-average tuition to look at lowering rates.
The Trump administration's proposal, by contrast, says only the degrees spelled out in the new regulation can count as professional programs.
Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow $50,000 a year and up to $200,000 in total.","A coalition of nursing and other health care organizations are angry over a Trump administration plan that could limit access to student loans in some cases.

Students pursuing graduate degrees in nursing, physical therapy, public health and some other fields would face tighter federal student loan limits under the plan because it doesn't consider them professional programs.

The revamp is part of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress.

While graduate students could previously borrow loans up to the cost of their degree, the new rules would set caps depending on whether the degree is considered a graduate or professional program.

The Education Department is defining the following fields as professional programs: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology.

Left out are nursing, physical therapy, dental hygiene, occupational therapy and social work as well as fields outside of health care such as architecture, education and accounting.

While the plan is still being finalized, the new student loan caps would take effect next July.

Why this is happening now

The Trump administration says limits on graduate loans are needed to reduce tuition costs. It believes that capping student loans will push universities charging higher-than-average tuition to look at lowering rates.

To define what counts as a professional program, the Education Department is turning to a 1965 law governing student financial aid. The law includes several examples of professional degrees but says it isn't an exhaustive list. The Trump administration's proposal, by contrast, says only the degrees spelled out in the new regulation can count as professional programs.

One in 6 of the nation’s registered nurses held a master’s degree as of 2022, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.

The details of the plan were recently hashed out in a federal rulemaking process.

What this means for students

Some future students could find it more costly or difficult to pursue a specialized degree. Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow $50,000 a year and up to $200,000 in total.

Other graduate students, such as those pursuing nursing and physical therapy, would be limited to $20,500 a year and up to $100,000 total.

Trump administration says impact will be minimal

The Education Department says its data show 95% of nursing students, for example, are in graduate programs that won’t be affected by the new caps. The department says the vast majority of students are in programs that cost less than the $100,000 cap being proposed for federal student loans.

Students already enrolled in graduate programs would be grandfathered into current lending limits.

Health groups say change will worsen nursing shortage

A coalition of health care organizations has urged the Education Department to change course, arguing that post-bachelor’s health care degrees that are needed for licensure or certification should be considered a professional degree.

They also say that fields being excluded are largely filled by women and in high-demand. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report in 2019, women made up about three-fourths of the full-time, year-round health care workers in the U.S. and accounted for a much higher share in jobs such as dental and medical assistants.

The organizations contend that capping federal student loans will make the ongoing nursing shortage even worse, force students to seek more expensive private loans and threaten patient care.

The American Association of Colleges of Nursing says if the proposal is finalized, “the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.”

Giving nurses a chance to further their education and advance their careers has attracted young people to the profession, said Susan Pratt, a nurse who is also president of a union representing nurses in Toledo, Ohio.

But making that harder could push away future nurses, she said.

“It's just a smack in the face,” Pratt said. “When we were during the pandemic, the nurses showed up, and this is the thanks we get.”

But new international students at CU Boulder declined 27 percent, mostly among graduate students.
DU was down 136 international students (its own statistics show 113), and the Colorado School of Mines dropped sharply by 254 students.","Almost a year into the Trump administration’s crackdown on visas and immigration, Colorado universities reported a steeper decline in international students than the rest of the nation.

More concerning, while the overall number of international students on U.S. campuses is down 1 percent from the previous academic year, new international students declined 17 percent, according to new fall 2025 snapshot data published this week by the Institute for International Education.

The snapshot is based on 825 institutions that host more than half of all international students.

This could signal larger decreases ahead as international students graduate and if difficulties obtaining student visas remain. International students have faced new rules causing visa delays and denials, social media vetting policies, travel restrictions and universities nationwide have faced cuts to federal research funding that supports graduate students, according to the survey.

“While we share concern about the recent decline … our commitment remains unwavering: to create an environment where students from around the world feel valued, supported, and inspired to succeed,” said Angie Paccione, executive director of the Colorado Department of Higher Education. “We want future students to see Colorado as their academic home — a place where they can learn, thrive, and belong.”

How did Colorado schools fare this fall?

The report shows graduate students are driving most of the decline. That’s true for the University of Denver, where international enrollment declined 19 percent this fall, driven mostly by graduate students.

The Colorado School of Mines cohort dropped about 8 percent. Colorado State University’s international enrollment decreased by 4.5 percent. CU Boulder’s undergraduate international numbers were down 10 percent.

Figures weren’t available for all new international students in Colorado who are on campus for the first time. But new international students at CU Boulder declined 27 percent, mostly among graduate students. The federal government has cut research funding at many universities, which attract graduate students.

There are significant cultural and economic consequences. One national study shows the decline amounts to $1.1 billion in lost revenue and nearly 23,000 jobs.

“Their diverse perspectives enrich our classrooms, and their cultural and economic contributions — amounting to more than $409 million — strengthen communities across the state,” Paccione said.

No university would speculate on the impacts of federal government decisions. A CU spokesperson said the university is focused on supporting the international community.

“We are also looking at ways to strengthen our enrollment strategies and overall support for international education and global initiatives that will continue to drive our value as a leading public research university.”

Last academic year’s figures show slight growth

Another Institute for International Education report released this week, the Open Doors report, shows the slowing began last school year. The number of international students in Colorado grew 1.8 percent last academic year compared to 4.5 percent the previous year. Nationwide, total international student numbers fell 7 percent.

It shows 10,547 students from abroad studied at Colorado universities last year, up 184 students from the year before. Colorado slipped from 23rd to 24th in the nation.

India remained the dominant sender, making up 33 percent. China declined from 11.2 to 9.7 percent. Kuwait stayed about the same, Saudi Arabia had a slight increase, and the number of students from Canada stayed about the same.

CU Boulder, CU Denver and Colorado State University all grew in international students last year. DU was down 136 international students (its own statistics show 113), and the Colorado School of Mines dropped sharply by 254 students.

Study abroad

The number of students studying abroad increased modestly to 6,583, with CU Boulder sending the most students. The most popular destinations were Italy, Spain, the UK, France and Japan.

In terms of the percentage of students who study abroad, the Institute for International Education ranked the University of Denver ninth among doctoral-granting institutions. More than 71 percent of 2023-24 graduates studied abroad. Students pay tuition to DU, and then DU pays that tuition to the study abroad program. The Cherrington Global Scholars initiative covers the cost of round-trip airfare and visa application fees.

This academic year, 846 DU students have committed to going abroad, with most already at their destinations for the fall quarter.

“DU study abroad students expand their horizons, deepen cultural understanding, and build lifelong skills and confidence that empowers them to grow academically, personally, and professionally in ways no classroom at home can fully replicate,” said Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, vice provost for internationalization.

In the spring of 2025, CU Boulder posted a 40 percent year-over-year increase in students studying abroad. The university ranked fifth among doctorate-granting institutions for providing semester-long study abroad opportunities. It ranked 13th for institutions awarding credit for study abroad.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/09/210908-CU-UNIVERSITY-OF-BOULDER-HIGHER-EDUCATION-COLLEGE-KEVINJBEATY-01.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:57:05.395992

Charlotte is over 150 miles from the coastal border, over 500 miles from the Canadian border, and over 1,200 miles from the Mexican border.
So why, then, were Border Patrol agents—mostly known for their operations along the U.S.-Mexico border—arresting people deep in the interior of the country?
Roving patrols Historically, Border Patrol agents would only conduct these vehicle searches near the border to prevent illegal entry into the United States.
Border Patrol agents are rarely disciplined for misconduct, even when it results in death.","When Border Patrol agents descended upon Charlotte, North Carolina last week, many wondered why they were allowed to stop and question people so far from the border. Typically, it’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who have become ubiquitous with the largescale enforcement operations of the second Trump presidency, seen roaming the streets of places like Chicago and Los Angeles.

Charlotte is over 150 miles from the coastal border, over 500 miles from the Canadian border, and over 1,200 miles from the Mexican border. So why, then, were Border Patrol agents—mostly known for their operations along the U.S.-Mexico border—arresting people deep in the interior of the country?

The short answer: legally, Border Patrol has more authority than most people realize—and politically, the Trump administration is leveraging every ounce of that authority.

What the 100-mile zone does (and doesn’t) mean

A key source of confusion is the so-called “100-mile zone.” Under Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), immigration enforcement officers—including both ICE and Border Patrol—can “board and search for” unauthorized immigrants on vessels, trains, aircraft, or vehicles located “within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States.”

Federal regulations define that “reasonable distance” to generally be within 100 miles of land and coastal borders. (Airports are not covered in the 100-mile zone, as they serve as ports of entry for international travelers.)

The 100-mile zone limits Border Patrol’s authority to a certain extent: they cannot board buses or trains outside the zone, nor can they set up fixed vehicle checkpoints. It is, however, within their power to pull a driver over and interrogate them about their immigration status if they have “reasonable suspicion” that they are not a citizen.

Border Patrol vs. ICE: Why the distinction is blurring

The INA defines agents from both Border Patrol and ICE as “immigration officers,” meaning they share a set of nationwide enforcement authorities, including:

The power to interrogate any person they believe may be an immigrant about their right to be in the United States.

The power to make warrantless arrests if an individual is believed to be violating immigration law and likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained.

The power to make arrests for immigration-related felonies and, in some cases, other federal crimes committed in their presence.

These authorities apply anywhere in the country, not just near the border.

Roving patrols

Historically, Border Patrol agents would only conduct these vehicle searches near the border to prevent illegal entry into the United States. Now, they’re being used by immigration agents far from the border, on the mere suspicion that someone “looks” undocumented. The Trump administration has taken this authority to the extreme, sending Border Patrol and ICE “roving patrols” to terrorize communities.

The Supreme Court intervened to let the controversial tactic continue. A majority of the justices overturned, without any explanation, a ruling that masked and armed agents could not snatch people off the street and question them based on their perceived race, what language they speak, what they do for work, and even where they happen to be when they encounter an immigration agent. Both a federal court in Los Angeles and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that these actions amounted to illegal racial profiling.

In a concurrence, Justice Kavanaugh argued that these stops were not a significant problem for citizens and lawfully present immigrants, based on his belief that individuals could show ID and be permitted to go immediately. However, in many cases, this has proven to be false, as Department of Homeland Security officers have detained U.S. citizens and lawfully present immigrants for hours, or days, while their paperwork was checked.

While the case will likely eventually reach the Supreme Court again, for now, courts have little ability to step in to limit the actions of these roving patrols.

Border Patrol: A history of violence and immunity

Under President Trump’s mass deportation agenda, every immigration officer counts—so both ICE and Border Patrol are pulled into interior operations that would have previously been handled by ICE alone.

Border Patrol is not only legally able to participate, they’re well-practiced in aggressive enforcement tactics developed in border communities where they have enjoyed heightened authority for over a century.

Since its creation in 1924, the Border Patrol agents have stereotyped and dehumanized the targets of enforcement actions. The agency reveals little to the public or Congress about how it operates and largely gives its officers autonomy in the field. Border Patrol agents are rarely disciplined for misconduct, even when it results in death. Despite this lack of transparency and accountability, the budget, workforce, and arsenal of the agency have grown significantly over the decades; a growth which has been supercharged by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immigration-impact-border-patrol-charlotte-zone.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 17:57:20.396101

Judge Ann Aiken at the U.S. District Court in Eugene granted a request from the nonprofit Newport Fishermen's Wives and Lincoln County for a temporary restraining order in the case pending further proceedings.

The helicopter normally stationed at a small USCG facility in Newport was abruptly moved 70 miles south to North Bend, and the plaintiffs argued that DHS was illegally shuttering the facility without any public notice or opportunity for comment.

While there are procedures under federal law which might allow Noem to shut down the facility, the plaintiffs argued that she both did not follow those procedures and, even if she had, they said the decision would not have been ""legally or factually defensible.""

""The evidence before the Court at this juncture is that those procedures were not followed and the Court can discern no hardship to Defendants in an injunction requiring them to continue operating the Newport Air Facility as they have for the better part of four decades,"" Aiken wrote in her opinion.

The DHS decision to remove the helicopter from Newport came about after local officials learned earlier this month that the federal agency was looking at the Newport Municipal Airport as the possible location for a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility.

According to Lincoln County Commissioner Walter Chuck, DHS moved the helicopter on Oct. 30, without any prior notification to local leaders.

""If there is a rescue helicopter that is a half an hour, one hour away, it makes it very difficult for our men and women to survive in the cold waters. Hypothermia sets in very quickly,"" Taunette Dixon of the Newport Fishermen’s Wives told KGW last week.

In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said that the helicopter has been stationed in Newport for nearly 40 years and that moving the helicopter leaves one of the Pacific's most dangerous stretches without timely aerial coverage, putting lives at risk.

""This helicopter isn’t a luxury — it’s a critical part of how we keep people alive on the Oregon Coast,"" he said.

As of Monday night, the Newport air station was completely unstaffed. Meanwhile, Dungeness crabbing season is set to begin Dec. 16.

Judge Aiken's restraining order will last 14 days unless extended or replaced with a permanent injunction.

In a video posted to social media on Tuesday, Newport Mayor Jan Kaplan said that a Texas-based firm called Team Housing Solutions, which had initially inquired about leasing airport property in an apparent bid to set up a detention location for ICE, was now actively contacting hotels along the Oregon coast. They were looking into pricing and availability for up to 200 rooms for a year, the mayor said.

There also remain 18 job postings for an ICE facility in Newport, the mayor said, with the latest posted Nov. 19.

The four politicians, along with two others, had made a video encouraging US military service members to resist unlawful orders – a message that angered Trump, who posted on social media that the group were “traitors” and thus could be jailed or even face the death penalty.

The statement, released by congressional lawmakers Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, confirmed that the FBI had contacted the House and Senate sergeants at arms requesting interviews with them.

“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our constitution,” they said, adding that they had each sworn an oath “to support and defend” the US constitution.

“That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship,” they added.

The statement deepens a dispute between the Trump administration and Democrats, including Arizona senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly and Michigan congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, over the video message, which urged the military and intelligence services members to “refuse illegal orders”.

Slotkin said the FBI’s counter-terrorism division had notified the group that “they are opening what appears to be an inquiry against the six of us” and described the move as a “scare tactic” by Trump.

“To be honest, the president’s reaction and the use of the FBI against us is exactly why we made the video,” she said.

“He believes in using the federal government against his perceived adversaries, and he’s not afraid to use the arms of the government against people he disagrees with.

An Alien File (A-File) is a record that holds a noncitizens’ immigration history. It includes copies of forms they may have filed, information about their immigration arrests (if they have had encounters with immigration enforcement), and some immigration court records. This file is crucial to immigrants and their legal representatives when applying for immigration benefits or defending themselves against potential deportations. Unlike in criminal courts, where defendants have the right to access their criminal files, noncitizens in immigration proceedings must obtain their A-Files by filing requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Recently, immigration attorneys have been reporting increased incidents of USCIS rejecting requests or withholding information contained in A-Files when filing these FOIA requests. The changes seemingly deviate from USCIS procedures described in guidance documents. For example, attorneys reported that the agency required new information to verify individuals’ identity when making the request. Also, practitioners state that the agency now redacts certain forms with information that it previously released. These withholdings not only act as roadblocks to individuals’ understanding of their immigration history, but can also stymie legal representatives’ ability to provide noncitizens with adequate legal advice.

On November 24, 2025, the Council filed a FOIA request with USCIS for updated guidance materials the agency uses to process FOIA requests for A-Files. The request seeks current agency guides and other records of updates to the procedures, documents of new training, and other related records. It builds on the documents USCIS previously published.

Andrea Velez, an American arrested by US immigration officials over the summer, described how she was accosted by masked agents while on her way to work. She said she was charged with assaulting an officer and held for two days in a federal detention center, where detainees had to pay for a cup in order to have water. The charges against her were ultimately dismissed due to what her attorney described as a lack of evidence.

Democrats organized the hours-long congressional oversight hearing in Los Angeles in order to hear testimony about the impacts of Donald Trump’s sweeping deportation agenda, and look at alleged civil rights abuses by federal agents and the “unlawful” detention of US citizens.

“Every person in our country has a right to due process, regardless of immigration status. It’s critical that the Oversight Committee document and hold accountable those that are defying the constitution, violating civil rights, and terrorizing families and communities,” Robert Garcia, a Democratic California congressman, said in a statement.

The White House said earlier this month that the federal government had arrested more than 150,000 undocumented immigrants and deported nearly 140,000 people since Trump took office.

His administration has made southern California a focal point for its aggressive mass deportation campaign. Federal agents have descended on car washes and Home Depot stores, and near schools and workplaces, leaving southern California communities in fear and parks and churches empty. The federal government has been accused of “blatant racial profiling” and civil rights violations.

“Right now we are living an American nightmare,” said Jasmine Crockett, a Democratic representative from Texas.

The situation has left lasting effects on southern California communities and residents affected by the raids.

Velez said in her testimony: “I still live with the trauma everyday.”

Karen Bass, LA’s mayor, described the raids as “an attack from our own federal government” and an affront to cities and people across the US.

“We will hold every federal agency accountable, and we will relentlessly defend the rights of every resident in Los Angeles – and across this nation,” Bass said. “Reports that Angelenos, including US citizens, were forcibly held, physically attacked, and deprived of their freedom without cause are not only outrageous – they are intolerable.”

Garcia on Monday announced the creation of a new oversight dashboard documenting “verified incidents of possible misconduct and abuse” during federal immigration enforcement operations”.

Both researchers advise journalists to familiarize themselves with the research to date on how immigration enforcement in the U.S. has affected children.
But journalists should keep in mind that immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has been much more aggressive than in recent decades.
The Effects of Immigration Enforcement on Student Outcomes in a New Era of Immigration Policy in the United States David Figlio and Umut Özek.","Two new studies provide a first look at how schoolchildren in two of America’s largest states have been affected by the immigration crackdown President Donald Trump ordered after taking office in January. Both show student performance fell during the spring semester in parts of California and Florida as authorities began enforcing federal immigration laws much more aggressively than in prior years.

The studies also reveal a dynamic many news stories overlook: The surge in immigration raids and arrests has consequences for various student groups — not just unauthorized children or children whose parents are not authorized to be in the U.S.

“This is much broader than that,” says economist David Figlio, who cowrote one of the papers.

The first paper, published Nov. 4 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that student absences spiked in southern California after the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol launched “Operation Return to Sender” at the beginning of the year.

Federal officials targeted California’s Central Valley starting Jan. 7, the day after Congress certified the results of Donald Trump’s presidential election win. Many parents in the area, a major hub for agriculture and food processing, kept their kids home from school.

Stanford University education professor Thomas Dee, who conducted the first study, estimates that students in the five Central Valley counties he examined missed an estimated 22% more days of school during the spring semester of 2025 than they had in the spring semesters of 2024 and 2023. Younger kids were absent most often. For example, the average number of days that schools reported pre-kindergarten students as being absent rose an estimated 35%.

The second paper, a working paper the National Bureau of Economic Research released Nov. 10, offers a detailed look at student performance in Florida. It examines test scores, attendance and discipline across grade levels in an unidentified Florida county that researchers describe as large, urban and home to one of the nation’s 10 biggest school districts.

A main takeaway of that analysis: Test scores dropped among middle and high school students who speak Spanish at home, the vast majority of whom are U.S. citizens. That includes children whose families are from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where U.S. citizenship is granted at birth, says Figlio, who coauthored the working paper with economist Umut Ozek.

As of 2022, nearly one-third of all kids living in Florida were Puerto Rican, according to 2024 report from the National Research Center on Hispanic Children & Families, a collaboration of three universities and the nonprofit research organization Child Trends.

Schools that primarily serve students from lower-income households saw their average test scores fall farther than schools that primarily serve students from wealthier households. Girls’ scores tended to drop more than boys’ scores. Meanwhile, lower-performing students’ scores worsened more than those of higher-performing students.

Absentee rates in both states

The researchers all looked for statistically significant changes in absenteeism during the spring 2025 semester. Dee found that the average student in southern California missed an estimated two additional days of school.

He says schools in other parts of the U.S. may see student attendance dip when immigration enforcement increases. He points to Charlotte, North Carolina as a recent example.

On Nov. 17, more than 30,000 kids in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg public school system were absent — three times as many students as the previous Monday , The Charlotte Observer reports. Two days earlier, masked Border Patrol agents arrived in the state’s largest city for an immigration crackdown. By Wednesday, more than 250 people had been arrested, according to The Associated Press.

“I suspect we will see similar effects elsewhere, but I think this is an active area of research and we’re going to want to know more,” says Dee, a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Education and a fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning public policy think tank at Stanford.

However, Figlio and Ozek determined that absentee rates in the Florida county they studied stayed about the same after immigration authorities ramped up enforcement efforts.

How the two studies differ

Differences in the researchers’ findings could be due to several factors, including student demographics and the type of immigration enforcement each paper examines.

In the Florida county that Figlio and Ozek studied, more than 35% of public school students are Hispanic. Dee studied five California counties where more than 70% of public school students are Hispanic.

Each study looks at immigration enforcement from a different lens. Dee aimed to gauge the impact of a series of immigration raids that occurred unexpectedly in southern California in January 2025. Less than two weeks after the raids, Trump rescinded national guidelines that had been in place since 2011 to discourage law enforcement officials from enforcing immigration laws in so-called “sensitive areas” such as schools and churches.

Dee’s research shows how an unusually large increase in daily student absences across southern California coincided with four days of concentrated immigration enforcement in that region.

Figlio and Ozek, on the other hand, looked at changes in the rate of immigration arrests in Florida over a longer stretch of time. They learned that apprehension rates rose sharply after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. But the number of student absences in the county they studied stayed about the same during the spring 2025 semester, explains Figlio, a professor of economics and education at the University of Rochester who is a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Florida test scores

Figlio and Ozek did find a link between immigration arrests and scores on Florida’s statewide exam, the Florida Assessment of Student Thinking, administered three times a year to students in most grades. They found that test scores dropped during the spring 2025 semester, compared to the scores students received earlier in the 2024-25 academic year and during the 2022-23 academic year.

To better understand that relationship, they pored over data on country of origin for unauthorized immigrants who had been arrested in Florida as well as for students in the Florida county. They show that after Trump took office, immigration arrest rates tripled for unauthorized immigrants across all countries of origin. Arrest rates increased even more for unauthorized immigrants from certain parts of the world, including Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.

Figlio and Ozek created a measure they call “school-level immigration apprehension intensity,” which represents the proportion of students at each individual school who were born in the same countries as the unauthorized immigrants who had been apprehended. They discovered that test scores for Hispanic students and students who speak Spanish at home tended to drop more at schools where a larger proportion of students were born in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua, consistent with the statewide apprehension trend.

Their paper uses percentiles to describe the changes in test scores. They refer to the difference between Hispanic students’ and non-Hispanic white students’ scores — historically, Hispanic students’ scores have lagged behind those of white students — to give readers a sense of how large the drop in test scores was in spring 2025.

They write: “These are relatively modest effects: For example, the White-Hispanic test score gap in [this county] is 17 percentiles (so the effect on Hispanic students represents only about 3 percent of this gap) while the gap between English-speakers and Spanish-speakers is 8 percentiles (so the effect on Spanish-speakers corresponds roughly to 10 percent of this gap.”

Florida student discipline

School discipline reports also fell among Hispanic students and students who speak Spanish at home, albeit slightly. In their paper, Figlio and Ozek offer two possible reasons for that.

“First, it could be due to change in student behavior: students who are more likely to be exposed to immigration apprehensions (Hispanic and Spanish-speaking students) might try to avoid getting in trouble at school,” they write. “Second, it could be due to change in educators’ attitudes towards these students: teachers and principals might be more lenient towards similar behaviors from students who experience hardships due to increased immigration enforcement. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, we are unable to disentangle these two channels.”

News reporting tips

Dee and Figlio offered three tips to help journalists report on immigration enforcement under President Trump and its impact on local children.

1. Explain that missing school is a big deal for students.

Student attendance is a leading indicator of student performance. Dee stresses that it’s also a “harbinger of downstream impact,” because coming to school regularly influences how much and how well kids learn and how connected they feel to their school. When kids are frequently absent, they tend to earn lower test scores and take longer to graduate high school, which can later affect their future career choices and personal income.

Dee urges journalists to remind audiences that K-12 schools already are struggling to make up for learning losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. They continue to wrestle with chronic absenteeism, which worsened after COVID-19 and remains high nationwide.

“These immigration raids are complicating recovery,” Dee says.

Absenteeism can also hurt a school’s finances. Public school funding in some states, including California, New York and Texas, is based on average daily attendance.

2. Make clear that immigration enforcement activities affect whole communities, including people who are not immigrants.

“One thing I think our study helps bring to light is the notion that, if we are correct, there is community impact,” Figlio says.

He recommends that journalists broaden their immigration coverage by focusing on how people of various ages and backgrounds are affected by the immigration crackdown. A story he hasn’t seen told is increased enforcement has impacted families from Puerto Rico.

“Journalists have focused a large, large amount on undocumented people in the United States, and I think that’s important — but it’s a ‘yes and … ’ [situation] as far as I’m concerned,” Figlio adds. “I’d like journalists to dig in more.”

Dee recommends journalists ask teachers how immigration enforcement has affected classroom management and lesson planning. They should ask students how it has affected their classroom activities, friendships and lives outside school.

3. Familiarize yourself with the body of research on how immigration enforcement activities affect students.

Both researchers advise journalists to familiarize themselves with the research to date on how immigration enforcement in the U.S. has affected children. Figlio says journalists should not read his paper and assume they know enough to report thoroughly on the topic.

“This is the most current, most relevant data out there — but it’s still just one study,” Figlio says.

Earlier studies can provide important insights on how immigration enforcement impacts a variety of student-related metrics, including mental health and educational attainment years into the future. But journalists should keep in mind that immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has been much more aggressive than in recent decades.

A paper Dee cowrote several years ago finds that Hispanic student enrollment fell in U.S. counties where local law enforcement agencies partnered with federal agents to enforcement immigration laws under so-called ‘‘287(g)agreements.” Between 2000 to 2011, a total of about 320,000 Hispanic public school students in those counties were displaced, according to the analysis, published in 2019 in the American Educational Research Journal.

In response to the President’s attacks on Minnesota’s Somali community, Congresswoman McCollum joined Minnesota leaders and stakeholders from the Somali community at a press event in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda on Monday morning to defend our Minnesota values and vibrant immigrant communities. During the press event, Congresswoman McCollum delivered the following remarks(link is external):

“The Somali-American community is a vibrant part of our state, and I’m here today to stand with my brothers and sisters. In Minnesota, as was pointed out by the other speakers, we welcome our immigrant neighbors and treat them with respect, and we treat them with dignity. It’s been 50 years since the Vietnam War when we welcomed Hmong and Lao war veterans who fought alongside American forces during the secret war in Laos. They were welcomed into our communities. In the 1990s during the Somali Civil War, Minnesota again provided a safe new home for families displaced by extreme violence. The Minnesota immigrant communities are making contributions that make our neighborhoods and our nation a better place.

“Republicans continue to single out Democratic states that follow federal immigration law, turning our neighbors into scapegoats to win votes. I’m ready to get to work, seriously, about fixing our broken immigration system. It’s time for Trump and Republicans to come to the table if they truly care about comprehensive reform that upholds America’s values and keeps our country safe. Instead, for months Trump’s been stoking tensions across the country with reckless and illegal mass deportations that violate the essence of America: due process. Across America, he’s illegally deploying the National Guard and at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. In Washington D.C., it’s $1.3 million per day for the deployed National Guard.

“Now, back to late Friday night, when he hurled ugly late-night threats against Minnesota’s Somali community. You have to ask yourself why. It’s because Trump and Republicans are doing nothing to address the real crises facing us as Americans: The U.S. economy is in shambles, the cost of living is soaring, Trump and Republicans have created a health care crisis, and they’ve failed to deliver essential heating assistance for Minnesotans this winter.

“We know that when Donald Trump is in trouble, he always falls back to what he knows: throwing attacks and creating chaos. Americans deserve better than Trump’s attacks and misinformation about what’s happening here in Minnesota. Here’s the reality: Crime is declining. We continue to be ranked as one of the best states to start a business and raise a family. If Trump and House Republicans are serious about addressing the real challenges facing our country, they wouldn’t be attacking; they’d be listening to Minnesotans seeing their health care premiums rise, struggling to afford Trump’s taxes of tariffs – and that effects everything from groceries, to gas, to heating.

“I want to be clear: An attack against one of us is an attack against all of us. I’m proud to stand up for our Minnesota values with my brothers and sisters. I thank Governor Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison for all they do to move things forward in court. And I’m so proud to stand with my brothers and sisters in the Minnesota House and Senate. We haven’t changed our values since I served here. Let me say it again: An attack against one of us is an attack against all of us.”

Lauren Underwood on Monday called conditions inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview “terrible” and warned that staffing is expected to triple by January at ICE facilities in the Chicago area in anticipation of more immigration enforcement.
The congresswoman told reporters she saw no detainees, despite ICE having processed some people in the Chicago area this weekend.
Within the six states, there are 3,000 detainees in custody.

Underwood’s office said the Broadview center will reportedly be used as a training facility for newly hired deportation officers.","U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood on Monday called conditions inside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview “terrible” and warned that staffing is expected to triple by January at ICE facilities in the Chicago area in anticipation of more immigration enforcement.

The congresswoman told reporters she saw no detainees, despite ICE having processed some people in the Chicago area this weekend. The ICE acting director told Underwood the last time anyone stayed overnight at the facility was “a couple weeks ago.” ICE officers told Underwood there were no detainees or staffers because they were “updating their systems and installing new security cameras.”

Underwood also staunchly warned that despite the departure of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino from Chicago, targeted immigration operations in the area are not over.

“Border Patrol is not gone. Mr. Bovino might not be here now, but according to these folks today, Operation Midway Blitz is still a joint operation between Border Patrol and ICE, and they have not received any instruction around an end date,” Underwood said. “I would not make those assumptions that there’s any kind of delay or reprieve.”

U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have insisted that Operation Midway Blitz would continue in Chicago, and a DHS source said about 100 agents would remain behind. The source also said 1,000 agents could return to the streets in March.

Underwood said the facility’s acting director, Samuel Olsen, is leaving his post this week and will be replaced by a new acting director who will be in charge of Broadview, the Downtown processing facility, and overseeing a six-state region.

DHS officials told Underwood that the Chicago immigration court docket is now among the largest in the nation, with more than 230,000 cases pending and more than 470,000 cases across the six-state region. She learned 30,000 people in Chicago are categorized as ready for removal. Within the six states, there are 3,000 detainees in custody.

She also warned that staffing for Chicago-area ICE facilities is expected to triple within months — stemming from a $150 billion to $170 billion infusion of funding over four years to DHS from President Donald Trump’s 2025 tax bill. Underwood said they are also pursuing contracts for temporary office space, potentially trailers near the Broadview facility. Underwood’s office said the Broadview center will reportedly be used as a training facility for newly hired deportation officers.

“That money is being spent here,” Underwood said. “The staff footprint in this facility and Downtown, the Downtown processing center is slated to probably triple by January. ... They are increasing immigration enforcement at that rapid rate. The American people need to see what’s happening in our community and the conditions under which people are being kept.”

Underwood’s visit provides a behind-the-scenes look at what advocates for detainees and former detainees described as unsanitary and cramped conditions, and what U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman even called a “prison.” Gettleman on Nov. 5 issued a 15-point temporary restraining order that calls for the federal government to improve conditions for detainees at the facility. The order addresses bedding, cleanliness, food, access to medications, access to lawyers and more. A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled for Dec. 17.

Underwood described the holding cells as segregated by gender, with the largest cell holding 45 plastic chairs and three showers. Beds for women were limited, and Underwood said most female detainees are being transferred to Kentucky. Transgender detainees are being sent to Denver. She called conditions at the facility “terrible” and “not a place where you want to spend time.” Gettleman recently heard testimony about people being held there 100-150 to a cell.

“The shower works and then each holding cell had a toilet. The toilet was not in any way anything that any of us would be comfortable using, certainly not in an area that is open to others,” Underwood said. “There’s nothing at all comfortable. It does not meet what I would consider to be the minimum criteria for a detention cell.”

Underwood said ICE staffers made it clear “they are under no legal obligation to meet those criteria because this is not a detention facility — it’s a processing facility.”

Signs in English and Spanish said detainees could use a shower at least every other day upon request. The same sign said detainees could receive bottles of water for free with meals and upon request. She said detainees were being fed Subway sandwiches or food from Walmart. The facility has no food vendors on contract and no medical contracts. She spotted one package of Huggies, some sanitary pads for women and foot powder.

Underwood said she has been trying to visit the facility since September. She said her visit was only granted after funding was restored after the government shutdown.

“I believe that the standards need to be improved, and I understand that there’s ongoing litigation that would then enhance those minimum standards, which we are monitoring very closely,” Underwood said. “I intend to be back to this facility, and I have made a request to visit all DHS facilities in Illinois, and I look forward to the administration granting that request.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fe79e88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3425+0+287/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F2e%2F4d9096e54bae961ab217479771b3%2Fbroadview-112525-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:41.114500

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First. It is part of a partnership between UCLA Law and Human Rights First, where UCLA Law students use the new Democracy Watch tracker to analyze legislative threats to democracy.

The Supreme Court seems primed to weigh in on President Trump’s attempted deployment of National Guard forces in the near future. Court battles in California, Oregon, Illinois, Washington, DC, and elsewhere have delayed the deployments, and President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to empower federal troops to carry out domestic law enforcement activities if the Court rules against him. This is in conjunction with increasing federal efforts to criminalize protests against the Trump Administration’s actions. A man was charged with a federal felony for providing face shields to people lawfully protesting in Los Angeles. At least five elected officials have been arrested or confronted while exercising lawful oversight duties or legally protesting. The September 22 Executive Order targeting “antifa” —which is not an organization— as a “domestic terrorist organization,” a term that holds no legal meaning, further underscores this pattern.The designation is so broad that it seems designed to justify the criminalization and targeting of anyone or any organization opposed to the Trump Administration’s policies. The accompanying National Security Presidential Memorandum makes this explicit, , authorizing action against individuals who they deem to be “obstructing the operations of the Federal Government,” explicitly citing opposition to ICE tactics. To drive this point home, when House Oversight Committee Democratic Ranking Member Robert Garcia (D-CA) unveiled an online tracker to document abuses and civil rights violations by ICE agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem tweeted a not-particularly-subtle threat that anyone who supports any sort of accountability for ICE misconduct will be prosecuted.

The right and freedom to dissent is fundamental to stemming the growth of authoritarianism. The ability to freely express opposition and disagreement with the actions of a government is a critical aspect of a functional democracy. Conversely, attempts to suppress dissent and the free exercise of protests is a hallmark of authoritarianism. Such attempts to inhibit or chill speech can include the use of militarized law enforcement in places with large protests, as well as political and legal attacks on people who exercise their right to protest or criticize the government or its actions.

And They Have Friends In the Legislative Branch

This criminalization of protest and dissent is not solely a top-down effort: the Trump Administration has allies in Congress and in State Legislatures around the country proposing and passing new laws designed to make it easier to prosecute protesters. Human Rights First’s Democracy Watch Tracker has identified 20 federal and 65 state-level bills from 2025 alone that, if passed, would curtail the right to protest and assemble in some form. Donald Trump has attempted to deploy National Guard troops to many cities that are most active in exercising their right to protest and assemble, namely Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland, and Chicago, with additional or rumored deployments pending in San Francisco, St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans, and New York. Many of the bills Human Rights First has tracked are coming from the very states that are actively protesting, and the Trump Administration is targeting.

Federal legislators from Tennessee have introduced the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act, , which would make publishing the name of an ICE agent a felony punishable by up to five years in prison— reinforcing their push to criminalize opposition to ICE tactics.. Notably, this bill does not apply the existing legal definitions of doxxing, codified at 18 USC 119, which prohibit the disclosure of Social Security numbers, home addresses, home and mobile phone numbers, personal emails, or home fax numbers. Instead, this bill criminalizes disclosing only the names of federal law enforcement officials.

Other bills are attempting to criminalize protestors by making it a federal crime to bloc public roads. Tennessee and Louisiana Senators support the Safe and Open Streets Act which would make obstructing or delaying commerce on a public road a federal crime, similarly punishable by up to five years in prison. California, New York, and Tennessee Members of Congress support the Safe Passage on Interstates Act to make obstructing or delaying commerce on a federal interstate highway a federal crime punishable by up to fifteen years in prison — an extremely harsh penalty clearly designed to discourage protests and dissent.

Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt, who represents St. Louis (where Trump has mused about sending guardsmen) sent a letter strongly supporting the investigations and crackdown on “antifa,” a term meaning “anti fascist” that is often used to imply the existence of an organized group that does not in fact exist. This rhetoric is an example of a dog-whistle that has been increasingly used to discredit and target protestors and political dissent by linking them to this nonexistent entity, and to justify increased law enforcement actions against lawful protest.

Around the country, similar legislation, especially related to blocking streets, has been introduced in several states either currently or prospectively facing National Guard deployments. In Oregon, House Bill 2534 makes impeding traffic a Class C felony under the riot statute (as above, a five-year prison sentence). In Illinois, H.B. 2357 makes blocking roadways a felony, and goes further by allowing the local sheriff where a planned protest is occurring to limit the size of the gathering at their discretion, while also prohibiting local jurisdictions from exercising Home Rule rights to permit protests. And in Tennessee, both H.B. 0729 and S.B 0672 go even further still: they increase the penalties for obstructing sidewalks, railways, elevators, aisles, or hallways to a felony punishable by up to six years in prison, while increasing the penalties for obstructing a highway or street to a maximum of 12 years in prison.

Louisiana’s S.B. 15 is taken straight from the Trump Administration’s playbook of viewing any opposition to ICE’s actions as illegitimate. Enacted into law on June 20th, 2025, it expanded Louisiana’s obstruction of justice statute to include civil immigration proceedings and any act intended to “hinder” or “interfere” with federal immigration enforcement efforts, an extremely broad category that could be plausibly invoked against anyone protesting ICE’s actions in Louisiana or distributing Know Your Rights information to immigrants. It further requires that, upon request, an individual must be released into federal custody if federal immigration officials allege “that the person to be released either illegally entered or unlawfully remained in the United States.” There is no requirement in the law that federal officials offer any proof of their allegations nor reason for wanting to detain the person.

The movement to target, suppress, and chill dissent is not just a Trump Administration effort. Federal and State legislators from around the country are not just supportive of the Administration’s criminalization of free speech and protest; they are working to enshrine these measures into law. From all levels of government, there is a coordinated authoritarian effort to suppress dissent and criminalize anyone who speaks out or opposes the Trump Administration’s policies. Empowering ICE to act anonymously and with impunity naturally leads to protests against such abuses of power. Legislatures are responding by attempting to criminalize those who protest and oppose that abuse of power, and the Trump Administration is using selective prosecution and the mobilization of the National Guard to make it clear that this Administration will respond to the exercise of constitutional rights with the authoritarian whip of state violence.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/themes/launchframe/assets/images/open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:23.864390

Despite those rulings, immigration judges continue to deny detainees’ requests for bond hearings, leading to additional lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court.","Another Iowa county jail is being sued for holding an individual who’s being detained by federal officials for possible deportation.

Javokhir Rahimov-Akobirovich, a native of Uzbekistan who is seeking asylum in the United States, is suing Hardin County Jail Administrator Nick Whitmore and Hardin County Sheriff Dave McDaniel in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.

Also named as defendants are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons, St. Paul ICE Field Office Director Peter Berg, and Acting Director for the Executive Office for Immigration Review Sirce Owen.

In his lawsuit, Rahimov-Akobirovich argues he has lived in the United States for the last five years and first came into contact with ICE when deportation proceedings were initiated in October 2020.

Court records indicate that in December 2020, Rahimov-Akobirovich was released from custody under a $5,000 bond that was approved by an immigration judge in San Diego, California. On Nov. 20, 2025, Rahimov-Akobirovich, who lives in Calexico, California, was traveling through Iowa when he was apprehended by ICE agents and placed in the Hardin County Jail.

The lawsuit alleges Rahimov-Akobirovich is the victim of the Trump administration’s new policy suggesting that every individual held for possible deportation is subject to mandatory detention regardless of how long they’ve lived in the United States.

“ICE and the DOJ have adopted this position even with the weight of almost every federal district court against them,” the lawsuit asserts, adding that without relief from U.S. District Court, Rahimov-Akobirovich faces “the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and community.”

The lawsuit, which alleges due-process violations and unlawful denial of release on bond, seeks a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order preventing federal officials from moving Rahimov-Akobirovich out of Hardin County until a decision can be reached in the matter. It alleges ICE is “ignoring” the fact that Rahimov-Akobirovich was free on bond, as approved by an immigration judge, when agents had him jailed in Hardin County.

The Department of Justice and the other defendants in the case have yet to respond to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit is one of hundreds filed throughout the United States challenging the Trump administration’s new interpretation of longstanding immigration laws. Dozens of cases have been filed in Iowa, with many of them naming as defendants the counties in which DHS and ICE are holding people in jail.

For close to 30 years, the DOJ and the courts held that individuals who were living in the United States and were then subject to deportation proceedings were entitled to a hearing on whether they should be released on bond while their deportation case was pending.

In July of this year, the Trump administration, through DHS, ICE and the Department of Justice, announced new “guidance” regarding the detention of applicants for admission to the United States. The guidance, which has since been declared to be DOJ policy, states that all persons who have entered the United States without inspection are deemed subject to mandatory detention without the possibility of a bond hearing.

On Sept. 5, 2025, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a decision consistent with the administration’s new policy, holding that immigration judges lack the authority to hear bond requests in such cases.

That shift in policy upends the longstanding interpretation of federal law that said individuals already living in the United States while seeking lawful admission — as opposed to individuals apprehended at the border — were entitled to due process and could argue for pretrial release on bond.

Lawyers for people rounded up and jailed under the administration’s new interpretation of the law argue the new policy was crafted in response to Congress’ appropriation of billions of dollars to expand the immigration system, which will soon enable ICE to double its capacity to jail individuals on any given day.

Since July, immigration judges around the nation have embraced the administration’s new interpretation of the law, stating they lack the jurisdiction to determine bond for any person who has entered the United States without inspection, even if that person has resided in the United States for decades.

That, in turn, has led to hundreds of detainees across the country suing DHS, ICE and their local jailers in U.S. District Court, which is entirely separate from Immigration Court. In the overwhelming majority of those cases, federal judges have ruled in favor of the detainees and said those individuals are entitled to bond hearings.

Despite those rulings, immigration judges continue to deny detainees’ requests for bond hearings, leading to additional lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-2048x1367.jpeg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:44.926226

When ICE agents swarmed a man in the parking lot of Downey Memorial Christian Church in Los Angeles, the church pastor told the officers that they didn’t have permission to be on church property. When they wouldn’t leave or show her any identifying information, she pulled out her phone to record the arrest. In response, an agent pointed a gun at her. Days later, while a man was videorecording a raid outside a Home Depot, DHS agents tackled him to the ground, arrested him and held him in detention for more than twenty-four hours.

These aren’t isolated incidents. Across the country, masked, armed federal agents in combat gear are snatching people from homes, workplaces, parks, and places of worship — and attacking those who attempt to film or document their activity.

The First Amendment protects the right to record and disseminate footage of law enforcement officers carrying out their official duties in public — that includes ICE, CBP and any other officers engaged in immigration enforcement activity. Yet in an apparent attempt to cover up their abuses, DHS is systematically attacking the right to record their agents at work.

That’s why we’ve filed a FOIA request for DHS records concerning people who record, livestream, or publicize immigration raids and arrests. We want to uncover relevant agency records — such as policy directives, training materials, legal analyses, and communications — to learn how the agency side steps the First Amendment right to record, how it’s instructing its agents to respond to cameras in the streets, and how widespread its retaliatory pattern is.

High-level Trump administration officials have already indicated that they consider the recording of immigration agents to be a threat rather than a right. At a July 2025 press event, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared that “violence” includes “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin later reinforced this characterization of filming agents, telling reporters that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents . . . . We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

On the other hand, DHS agents are recording their own interactions during raids, posting on social media, and providing exclusive access to reporters that support Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.

The administration has self-interested reasons to suppress community recordings of immigration raids. Bystander recordings of law enforcement have proven critical to uncovering abuses and holding the government accountable, from footage of police brutalizing Rodney King in 1991 to the video of Derek Chauvin murdering George Floyd in 2020. Independent documentation can also be crucial to track and provide legal support to detained people and to counter government lies about law enforcement incidents. Video recordings of recent immigration arrests have served all of these purposes, which is why we must urgently defend this fundamental First Amendment right.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/11/ICE-photographer-FOIA.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:59:49.270736

In response to viral videos of masked ICE and Border Patrol agents snatching people off the streets and assaulting bystanders, DHS threatened to prosecute anyone who films and posts footage online of federal officers, which the agency claims constitutes “doxing” and illegal harassment, even though doing so is protected by the First Amendment.

DHS targeted anonymous Instagram users, including our client, who reposted a video showing a Border Patrol agent conducting official government business in public. In response, DHS issued an administrative subpoena to Meta seeking to unmask the users' identities—giving them just 10 days to hire lawyers and fight the subpoena in federal court.

“This isn’t just about one Instagram account. It’s about whether you can hold law enforcement accountable without them coming after you,” said Jake Snow, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. “Recording police is legal. Sharing that recording is legal. Doing so anonymously is legal. And they are all protected by the First Amendment.”

Our client operates @LBProtest, an anonymous Instagram account focused on helping people find and participate in events and protests. They create and repost content that reflects their political views, and their connection to the Long Beach community. We filed a Motion to Quash the administrative subpoena on September 18, 2025, on behalf of our client.

“The government is unfairly–and illegally–targeting, arresting, and detaining people around the country whose speech it disfavors. The risk of being targeted in that way is terrifying,” said Chessie Thacher, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. “This victory protects not just our client, but activists, organizers, and other everyday people documenting police and ICE activity in public.”

The First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement while they perform their official duties in public, including video, audio, photography, and live-streaming. People have the constitutional right to identify law enforcement agents, including publishing their names and badge numbers. These protections extend to online spaces and platforms, including the right to share, repost, or retweet publicly-available content that identifies law enforcement or critiques their conduct, and to do so anonymously.

The DHS subpoena here is part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions. Today’s victory sends a clear message that transparency in law enforcement plays an essential role when democracy and people’s safety are under attack.",https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/default_images/aclu_blue_bkg_10_9.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 14:57:49.785901

ICE raid in St. Paul?

What we know:

The crowd had gathered outside a home in the area of Maryland Avenue East and Payne Avenue amid an operation that involved federal authorities, including ICE agents and a U.S. Marshals task force. St. Paul police officers were also at the scene, assisting with crowd control in riot gear.

Protesters held signs and called out anti-ICE chants as investigators worked inside a home.

The backstory:

Agents were on the scene at least through the 11 o'clock hour on Tuesday morning but cleared the scene starting around 12:30 p.m.

As they left, police used tear gas to clear protesters who were blocking vehicles in the street.

What were federal agents doing?

What we don't know:

FOX 9 has not been able to confirm whether the operation was related to immigration enforcement or simply a criminal investigation. FOX 9 has reached out to St. Paul police, the City of St. Paul, and the Department of Homeland Security for more information on the incident.

Agents at the scene did tell FOX 9's Corin Hoggard they were in the area looking for two people, one of whom ran away and went into a house.

Use of force by St. Paul police

What they're saying:

Outgoing St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter spoke with protesters following the raid but told the upset residents that he didn't yet have all the details about what happened.

""They don't coordinate with us,"" the mayor said, saying they weren't aware of the raid until it happened. ""They don't give us the information in advance… They sort of – what they do nationwide – pop up on the scene and create chaos and then leave. And then local communities are left trying to sort out chaos.""

Protesters raised concerns to the mayor about the use of tear gas and pepper spray by St. Paul police officers working crowd control during the incident. Two state lawmakers, Reps. Athena Hollins and Liish Kozlowski, said they were pepper sprayed by St. Paul police.

Speaking with the media afterward, Carter said it was a frustrating situation for everyone involved. ""Community members are frustrated. This is what we see ICE agents doing all over the country, showing up, creating havoc, creating chaos, and leaving local communities trying to figure out how to navigate the trauma they create. That's part of the troubling practice they create.""

Mayor Carter said his office would review the force used by St. Paul police officers to clear members of the crowd during the protest.

Broader Policy and Ethical Considerations The termination of Myanmar’s TPS designation exposes tensions between immigration policy, national security priorities, and human rights obligations.
Ethically, the move raises questions about the U.S.’s commitment to protecting vulnerable populations amid geopolitical interests.","The Trump administration’s decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Myanmar nationals living in the United States reflects a broader shift in immigration policy, emphasizing enforcement and national security over humanitarian considerations. This policy change affects nearly 4,000 individuals who initially received protection due to the armed conflict and humanitarian crises following Myanmar’s military coup in 2021. While the administration asserts that conditions in Myanmar have improved enough to warrant the termination of TPS, evidence from human rights organizations depicts an ongoing crisis. This article analyzes the policy’s rationale, its human rights implications, and resulting consequences for Myanmar refugees.

Policy Background and Rationale

Temporary Protected Status was originally granted to Myanmar nationals after the military coup created extraordinary and unsafe conditions for returnees. It ensured that those affected by the crisis could legally remain and work in the U.S. temporarily. The Trump administration’s policy reversal, effective January 26, 2026, is grounded in the Department of Homeland Security’s position that “""the situation in Burma has improved enough that it is safe for Burmese citizens to return home"" ”. The administration cites Myanmar’s end to the state of emergency, ongoing ceasefire agreements between ethnic armed groups and the military government, and plans for national elections as evidence of progress and a return to stability. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem emphasized,

“After reviewing country conditions in Burma and consulting with appropriate U.S. government agencies, the Secretary determined that Burma no longer continues to meet the conditions for TPS designation.”​

This policy represents a core element of the administration’s broader immigration approach, which has seen the rollback of TPS protections for multiple other countries. The stated goal is to return TPS designations to their original ""temporary"" intent, avoiding indefinite or extended stays under humanitarian protections.

Human Rights Context and Contradictions

While the administration highlights political and security improvements in Myanmar, human rights organizations paint a starkly different picture. The ongoing conflict since the coup has caused massive civilian displacement—estimated at over 3.5 million people—and numerous casualties due to military operations and airstrikes. Reports of arbitrary killings, disappearances, torture, and detentions persist. According to international observers, the elections planned by Myanmar's military are widely regarded as neither free nor fair, undermining claims of democratic progress.

Critics argue the policy disregards these human rights realities. The termination of protections for nearly 4,000 vulnerable individuals is seen as inconsistent with the ongoing humanitarian crisis. As one rights group has pointed out, “Homeland Security's misstatements in revoking TPS for people from Myanmar are deeply troubling,” reflecting a dissonance between U.S. policy and documented abuses. The decision is also viewed as part of a broader pattern of reducing humanitarian protections for immigrant communities in favor of stricter enforcement.​

Impacts on Myanmar Nationals and Broader Immigrant Communities

The elimination of TPS forces affected Myanmar nationals to either seek alternative immigration relief or risk deportation to a country still embroiled in violent conflict. Many individuals protected under TPS have established strong ties to the U.S., including work, family, and community involvement. This policy shift places not only these individuals at risk but also their families and dependents, contributing to heightened fears of detention, separation, and social disruption.

Moreover, this move fits within a wider crackdown on immigration, evidenced by simultaneous travel restrictions and TPS terminations for other nationalities. Concerns over visa overstays and national security cited by the administration advance a policy narrative that prioritizes enforcement objectives over humanitarian needs. This dynamic increases uncertainty and anxiety within immigrant communities, potentially undermining social cohesion and integration.

Broader Policy and Ethical Considerations

The termination of Myanmar’s TPS designation exposes tensions between immigration policy, national security priorities, and human rights obligations. While the administration frames the decision as evidence of political progress and a return to normalcy, ongoing abuses and instability indicate a considerably more complex reality. Ethically, the move raises questions about the U.S.’s commitment to protecting vulnerable populations amid geopolitical interests.

By revoking TPS protections, the administration arguably shifts away from humanitarian principles enshrined in U.S. immigration policy frameworks. This is part of what some rights advocates have characterized as “""the largest de-documentation effort in U.S. history"" ” which exposes hundreds of thousands of immigrants to deportation and dismantles protections built over decades.​

The Trump administration’s termination of Temporary Protected Status for Myanmar nationals underscores a decisive turn towards immigration policies centered on legal restrictions and security concerns rather than humanitarian imperatives. While framed as a response to improved conditions in Myanmar, the policy ignores substantial evidence of ongoing human rights abuses and conflict, placing vulnerable individuals at risk. The repercussions extend beyond Myanmar nationals to broader immigrant communities, highlighting critical ethical and policy challenges in balancing human rights with national security priorities.",https://impactpolicies.org/admin/storage/photos/shares/2025/Trump%20Myanmar%20TPS%20Termination%20and%20Its%20Impact%20on%20Human%20Rights%20and%20Refugees.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 14:57:45.659143

Vahid Abedini, an assistant professor of Iranian studies, was on his way to the annual conference of the Middle East Studies Association in Washington, D.C., on Saturday when he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Joshua Landis, the co-director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said.

It is still unclear why Dr. Abedini was arrested. Dr. Abedini posted on his LinkedIn page early Tuesday morning that he was “relieved to share that I was released from custody tonight.”

“It was a deeply distressing experience, especially seeing those without the support I had,” he wrote. He thanked friends and colleagues at the university, the Middle East Studies Association “and the wider Iran studies and political science community for helping resolve this.”

Lawyers from around the country are working together and organizing, to find legal strategies to free detained immigrants.

Monterey and Santa Cruz counties are at the center of a power struggle with the state over a key part of the clean energy transition—battery storage.

A congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday focused on what witnesses called the chilling effects of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Immigration Lawyers Get Help From Unlikely Allies In Fight To Free Clients

After the 2024 presidential election, Stacy Tolchin expected the next four years to be an uphill battle. The Pasadena-based immigration lawyer lived through the chaos from the first Trump term. She remembers family separation, the Muslim travel ban and attacks on refugee and asylum programs. Yet, Tolchin and other lawyers and advocates were still surprised at the speed and sophistication of the current administration’s mass deportation campaign.

“It’s really much worse than I even contemplated it would be at the beginning of the year,” she said. The Trump administration has stripped international students of their visas, deported people to one of the most dangerous prisons in the world, and launched violent immigration sweeps in American cities.

Besides the public-facing tactics, the administration has also made a series of quiet legal maneuvers that have made it much more difficult for immigrants to fight deportation cases. These efforts include: Funneling people into fast-track deportation programs, making it harder for immigrants to hire lawyers and making it almost impossible for detainees to get out on bond.

But after being knocked on their heels in the early months of Trump’s new term, lawyers nationwide are now banding together and developing their own legal strategies. “We need warriors, we need people to help us in this fight,” Tolchin said. Chief among them are writ of habeas corpus petitions — federal lawsuits that challenge illegal and indefinite detentions. Collectively, they have filed more than 4,000 habeas petitions as last-ditch efforts to get their clients released from immigration detention centers.

Filing a habeas petition is unfamiliar for many attorneys. To help bridge the knowledge gap, immigration lawyers are turning to informal networks for help. Some organizations, like the American Immigration Lawyers Association, have even hosted formal workshops where lawyers can network and get a crash-course in filing habeas petitions.

Why Regulating Battery Energy Storage Is Taking So Long On The Central Coast

Santa Cruz County took a small step last week toward developing a policy to regulate battery energy storage systems (BESS).

At almost the same time, Monterey County supervisors were having a similar conversation. “We just can’t have somebody come in here while we don’t have an ordinance,” said District 2 Supervisor Glenn Church, during a Nov. 18 meeting. “We gotta develop an ordinance.”

The heart of the issue for both counties is the idea of local control. Currently, companies can apply with the state for permits to build and run a BESS. They don’t have to go through the county. But, if counties have ordinances governing BESS facilities, a company can instead choose to go the local route. That could mean more community support.

Here’s the challenge—the state’s climate goals demand a lot more renewable energy storage, fast. Local government is often slow. In Santa Cruz County, they were deciding whether to start a year-long process to develop an ordinance. Even that was delayed. In Monterey County, they were weighing whether to enact a temporary moratorium on new BESS facilities. That didn’t happen either.

Congressional Hearing Examines Effects Of Immigration Enforcement In Southern California

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, convened a congressional hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Monday to gather testimony about alleged violations by federal immigration agents, whom they accuse of improperly detaining immigrants and citizens alike, often without probable cause or warrants.

The hearing included testimony from elected officials, experts and residents who have been directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Andrea Velez is a U.S. citizen who was detained by ICE agents while on her way to work in June. “Terrified, I used my work bag as a shield, but he slammed me into the sidewalk and accused me of interfering,” she said. “When I asked for his badge or a warrant, he refused and handcuffed me. They didn’t believe I was a U.S. citizen or bother to check my ID. I spent most of that first day shackled in a van watching others arrive, distraught and taken against their will.”

David Remnick

Editor, The New Yorker

In early September, the New Yorker staff writer Sarah Stillman received a video call from a group of eleven people who had been forcibly deported from the United States and flown to a secret detention camp in the forests of Ghana. “My stomach is really hurting, and we have to beg for food,” one man told her. “We fear we’ll be tortured and killed,” another said.

In this week’s issue, Stillman, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and many other awards, reveals how the Trump Administration has been deporting scores of people, including some who had lived here for decades and others who have no criminal records, to countries where they have no known connection––to Uzbekistan, South Sudan, Panama, Ghana, and the small African nation of Eswatini. Many of these people had been granted legal protection in the U.S. from being deported to their home countries, based on credible claims that they would face persecution, torture, or death there. By using this shadowy process, known as third-country removal, the Administration has found a way to sidestep that obligation; what happens to deportees abroad is out of the U.S. government’s hands. “It’s absolutely shocking and illegal,” an immigration attorney and activist says. “And it fits this Administration’s general pattern—draconian, cruel processes that create a spectacle and coerce people into leaving of their own accord.”

Many of the public raids, traffic stops, and aggressive arrests being carried out by federal immigration agents across the U.S. have produced horrifying images and have sparked opposition to the Administration’s policies. But this aspect of the American deportation regime has largely been hidden from the public; and, as Stillman reports, third-country removals are only growing more common. They are often done quickly and with great secrecy, leaving family members in the dark about the whereabouts of their loved ones. Stillman reports on an informal “detective agency of sorts,” made up of lawyers, human-rights advocates, and flight-tracking experts, that has sprung up to provide families with some answers. Still, many deportees enter a kind of black hole after they are sent abroad. Stillman, who has the skills of both an investigative reporter and a humane chronicler of our times, speaks to one man who tells her that before he was deported to Eswatini and confined there without legal rights, he’d lived in Brooklyn. They were, quite nearly, neighbors.
