“Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that ​was first reported by Fox News and ​reposted by the White House on social media.

Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and ‍2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline ​immigration policy involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations ⁠of visas and green cards, and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump’s policies, saying they curb rights like due process ⁠and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

Federal officials in recent weeks have portrayed Minnesota’s Somali community as a hotspot for fraud involving millions of federal dollars intended for social services.

Here's a breakdown of some of this year's defining moments, presented in no particular order.

Outrage, grief after Minnesota lawmaker shootings

Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were injured in what federal and state officials characterized as politically-motivated shootings in June.

Melissa and Mark Hortman were fatally shot in their Brooklyn Park home, while John and Yvette Hoffman were shot around 5 miles away in their Champlin home.

The attacks spurred a manhunt involving federal, state and local law enforcement for the suspected shooter, Vance Boelter. He was taken into custody less than two days after the shootings near his home in Green Isle, Minnesota.

Boelter has since been federally charged on six counts, which include murder, stalking and firearms violations. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in August. He's also been charged by the state with two counts of first-degree murder and four counts of attempted first-degree murder.

Court documents show Boelter's then-wife told an investigator they were ""preppers,"" meaning they ""prepare for major or catastrophic incidents."" She says her husband gave her a ""bailout plan"" before the attacks. She subsequently filed for, and was granted, a divorce.

State records show that Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board. He was first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016 and was reappointed by Gov. Tim Walz three years later.

""The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter,"" Walz's office said in a statement to WCCO. ""They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.""

Minnesotans and state and federal lawmakers mourned the loss of Melissa and Mark Hortman in the weeks following the attacks. Melissa Hortman represented Minnesota House District 34B as a member of the Democratic Party. She was elected to the Minnesota Legislature in 2004 and was in her 11th term.

Federal immigration enforcement operations reach Minnesota

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations targeting Somali immigrants began in the Twin Cities earlier this month. The actions started a day after President Trump said, ""I don't want [Somalis] in our country.""

On Thanksgiving, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, used a slur usually directed at people with intellectual disabilities to describe Walz, used racially and religiously prejudiced language against Rep. Ilhan Omar and said that Somali refugees are ""completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said its agents have arrested more than 400 people since ""Operation Metro Surge"" began. It's unclear how many of those 400 are still detained or have been sent elsewhere.

ICE agents have conducted operations in several cities around the metro. In Brooklyn Park, a coffee shop owner said agents lied to one of his employees before detaining him. WCCO reached out to ICE to ask what charges the employee faces and why he was detained, but has not heard back.

Minneapolis city leaders said on Dec. 10 that a U.S. citizen was wrongfully arrested by ICE agents because he looks Somali. WCCO reached out to ICE for a response to the accusation, but has not heard back.

Federal agents also gathered outside a home construction site in Chanhassen, where two men were atop an aerial work platform. One of the men came down after nearly two hours, and the other didn't come down until after the agents left. DHS officials say the men first climbed atop the roof after they ""fled from a vehicle and entered a construction site,"" and claim the first man to come down from the roof had entered the country illegally from El Salvador in 2019. He is now in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Omar, a Democrat, told WCCO in an interview on Dec. 14 that her son was pulled over by federal agents and asked him to prove his citizenship. ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons said the agency has ""absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son"" and accused her of trying to ""unfairly demonize our law enforcement officers."" Omar then responded, ""ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight. ICE now claims it has records of all the stops, and our office would welcome the opportunity to review them.""

Residents have clashed with ICE agents on several occasions since the operations began, including in south Minneapolis and the city's Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. Thousands of others have marched in protest of the federal actions.

Court documents said a federal agent was briefly kidnapped in Plymouth while conducting surveillance at an apartment complex, looking for a man who allegedly overstayed his student visa. Two people have been federally charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees in the incident.

Trump voices support for Lindell's bid for governor

Mr. Trump voiced support for Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Mike Lindell, founder and CEO of MyPillow, at a rally on Dec. 20 in North Carolina.

Lindell, 64, has joined a crowded Republican field seeking to unseat Walz in 2026. Mr. Trump said Lindell ""deserves to be governor of Minnesota"" after the myriad legal and financial woes the businessman dealt with in his quest to push conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.

""That man suffered. What he did, what he went through, because he knew the election was rigged. And he did it. I mean, he just did it as a citizen,"" Mr. Trump said.

Noem delivers bonus checks to MSP Airport TSA employees; union calls move illegal

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in November to deliver $10,000 bonus checks to Transportation Security Administration officers, some of whom worked during the 43-day federal government shutdown.

Local 899 Airport Screeners Union said the bonuses were illegal and only rewarded 7% of the MSP workforce. WCCO asked Noem why some staff were excluded from the bonus, and she said they went to staff nominated for the reward.

Rep. Emmer calls for ethics investigation into Rep. Craig's town hall stops

Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer in April called for federal lawmakers to launch an ethics investigation into Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota.

Craig and several other Democratic lawmakers across the country were making town hall stops in GOP-led districts in April to highlight the absence of Republican leaders at local events during the first months of President Trump's second term.

Emmer and fellow House Republican delegation members Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber, sent letters to the House Committee on Ethics and the Committee on House Administration urging a review of possible ethics violations by Craig.

""While her Republican colleagues have refused to show up and answer to their constituents in person, Representative Craig is actively showing up in their districts,"" Craig's office said.

Investigations into fraud in Minnesota reach new scrutiny

The Feeding Our Future scandal, the nation's largest COVID fraud scheme, garnered renewed focus from the Trump administration this year.

Somali Minnesotans are among the nearly 80 charged in connection with the scheme, in which prosecutors say defendants stole hundreds of millions of dollars that were supposed to be used to feed hungry children during the pandemic.

Mr. Trump has criticized Minnesota over the controversy, calling the state a ""hub of fraudulent money laundering activity"" and claiming ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great state and billions of dollars are missing.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson suggested earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could be $9 billion or more. Walz and other state officials disputed that the amount of taxpayer money stolen is that high.

In late December, Homeland Security agents in Minneapolis were ""conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud,"" according to Noem. Many of their targets came not from tips from the FBI, but from a viral video posted on social media. The video alleged nearly 12 day care centers in the state that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any service. CBS News conducted its own analysis here.

Amid the investigation and Thompson's accusation that fraud in the state could be $9 billion or more, Minnesota House and Senate Republicans called on Walz to resign. In response, the governor's office said Walz has been working for years to crack down on fraud and has asked the state Legislature for more authority to take aggressive action.

On Dec. 13, Walz unveiled a new statewide fraud prevention program, naming former FBI agent Tim O'Malley as the new director of program integrity. Republican State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said, in response to the announced program, a ""statewide director of program integrity isn't something you need when your commissioners are doing their jobs well in the first place.""

Special elections held after Eichorn and Mitchell resign

Minnesota officials held two special elections, in April and on Election Day in November, to fill the seats of former state senators Justin Eichorn and Nicole Mitchell.

Eichorn, a Republican from Grand Rapids, resigned in March in the wake of a federal criminal charge accusing him of soliciting sex from someone he thought was 17, but turned out to be an undercover cop. He is charged federally with attempted coercion or enticement of a minor, and pleaded not guilty to the charge in April.

Mitchell resigned in July after she was convicted of first-degree burglary and possession of burglary or theft tools for breaking into her stepmother's Detroit Lakes home in April 2024. The former Democratic state senator represented parts of Woodbury and Maplewood.

Republican Keri Heintzeman beat Democrat Denise Slipy to replace Eichorn in Senate District 6 in a special election held on April 29. Six months later, on Election Day, then-state Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jager defeated Republican Dwight Dorau for Mitchell's former seat in Senate District 47.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.
Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.","“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary

Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian

parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themercury.com/content/tncms/custom/image/47283276-d683-11e6-9ad2-7311962f5570.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-30 21:11:48.361845

Stephenson said she did not accept the characterisation that this was “a licence to discriminate based on looks”.","The new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission has asked campaigners who raised doubts about her appointment to “judge me on what I do”.

In one of her first media interviews since her appointment at the start of December, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson pledged to “uphold the rights of everybody across all protected characteristics”, after the UK government overruled the objections of parliament’s women and equalities committee about her suitability for the job.

Stephenson argued that open letters she had signed opposing censorship on campus and violence against campaigners had been “really widely mischaracterised as kind of anti-trans letters”.

Instead, she said, they were in line with her “lifelong commitment to protecting and upholding human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association and basic democratic rights”.

Stephenson donated to the 2022 campaign of the barrister Allison Bailey, who was found to have been unlawfully discriminated against by her chambers for her gender-critical views.

Asked what she would say to those who may feel she had taken a side in the debate, Stephenson said: “I was concerned about women who had been harassed or sometimes lost their jobs for the expression of legally protected views at a point when there was a public debate about changing legislation.”

She went on: “I would say, you know, judge me on what I do. I am really keen, I think it’s really important for the chair of the EHRC to uphold the rights of everybody across all protected characteristics.”

Acknowledging that “clearly I need to build a relationship” with the LGBTQ+ sector in her new role, she said: “I think it’s really important when we’re looking at this issue around single-sex spaces, to make sure that you also protect the rights of trans people.”

A number of LGBTQ+ organisations raised objections to Stephenson’s prior public statements after she was announced as the government’s preferred candidate. An open letter signed by Stonewall, Galop and TransActual, among others, said: “We recognise that Dr Stephenson has an impressive track record in the sector. However, she has also previously supported views seen at odds with inclusivity for all.”

Stephenson’s most pressing challenge in the new role is the formal guidance on how public bodies, businesses and other service providers should respond to April’s landmark supreme court ruling on biological sex that the equalities watchdog submitted to the government for approval in September.

Her predecessor, Kishwer Falkner, has criticised the amount of time ministers have taken to approve the new rules, while a leaked draft last month suggesting transgender people could be banned from single-sex spaces based on how they look caused consternation among LGBTQ+ advocates.

Stephenson said she did not accept the characterisation that this was “a licence to discriminate based on looks”. She said: “I think my starting point in all of this is that you have to ensure that everyone, as far as possible, has access to the services they need.”

She said it was “important to make sure that there are services provided for people who can’t or don’t want to use the services for their biological sex. It is about recognising that everybody has rights in this situation, but where you are providing single-sex services, the supreme court has said those have to be on the basis of biological sex.”

The UK government has previously insisted it will take as much time as necessary to “get right” new rules on access to single-sex spaces.

Asked if she would be prepared to accept changes to the draft guidance from ministers, Stephenson said she believed it was “legally sound” and that the EHRC was “really happy to provide [the government] with any evidence that they need”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18dbfe6db088cf20d7d1ca6681f960ce28d2a670/456_0_4998_4000/master/4998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74672cc9eda9253a9eb875a3f16ff05e",N,,2025-12-30 20:57:14.610457

Earlier this year, a group of states sued the Trump administration for sharing personal health data with DHS for immigration enforcement.
Chhabria later blocked the DHS and the HHS from sharing the data, calling on the departments to complete “a reasoned decisionmaking process.” The HHS for its part put out a notice laying out how it would give ICE certain information within the bounds of federal law, while ICE issued a memo as well.
Neither, however, addresses “why a more narrowly tailored policy” wouldn’t suffice for immigration enforcement purposes, Chhabria said.","The Trump administration’s health department is temporarily blocked from sharing certain Medicaid information with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a federal judge called the related federal policies “totally unclear” and apparently not “the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.”

Monday’s order from Judge Vince Chhabria of US District Court for the Northern District of California comes in a legal battle between states and the federal government over the use of state Medicaid data for immigration enforcement.

In Chhabria’s view, it’s “an open question” whether federal policies greenlight the US Department of Health and Human Services to share “sensitive medical information about Medicaid patients” with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.

Chhabria’s Monday preliminary injunction says it remains unclear whether the DHS can get from the HHS “any information relevant to any proceedings beyond criminal immigration investigations or civil enforcement actions.”

He also noted that it’s unclear “whether DHS may request any data from HHS about citizens or lawful permanent residents, including members of mixed-status households.”

The order isn’t entirely a win for the states Chhabria denied the states’ motion “as to the data that is the primary focus of the new policies—basic biographical, location, and contact information—because the sharing of such information is clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

He also noted that while the litigation plays out, the HHS can share Medicaid information pertinent “only to aliens who are not lawfully residing in the United States” and that “divulges only those aliens’ citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ce65934/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2Fe3%2F63ca97404c7dab9582c681323b88%2Fice2.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 19:56:25.861373

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city.","Springfield, IL (CAPITOL NEWS ILLINOIS) – In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.”

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

To hear the DOJ tell it, providing in-state tuition to immigrant residents unlawfully discriminates against out-of-state U.S. citizens.
The DOJ also said UVA tuition guidelines are ""in direct conflict with federal law.""
""As a result, Virginia law affirmatively removes immigration status as a barrier to establishing domicile and obtaining in-state tuition benefits.""
The federal government says the salve for Virginia's alleged encroachment of federal immigration law is federal preemption of the domicile rules used to determine in-state tuition.","The Trump administration filed a federal preemption lawsuit on Monday against the Commonwealth of Virginia over a policy that provides in-state tuition for immigrants who live in the Old Dominion.

In February, President Donald Trump signed an executive order entitled ""Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders."" The order aimed to keep ""taxpayer-funded benefits"" away from immigrants and directed officials to target ""[s]tate laws that provide in-State higher education tuition to aliens but not to out-of-State American citizens.""

Now, in a 13-page lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice is taking a constitutional swipe at the University of Virginia's tuition policies.

""Federal law prohibits States from providing aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States with any postsecondary education benefit that is denied to U.S. citizens,"" the lawsuit begins. ""There are no exceptions. Virginia violates it nonetheless. This court should put an end to this and permanently enjoin the enforcement of provisions of the Virginia Education Code that directly conflict with federal immigration law.""

The litigation focuses on two sections of Virginia law that recognize immigrants as ""Virginia residents based on certain conditions.""

The laws themselves do not mention immigrants or distinguish between classes of people, except for provisions outlining rules for military dependents. Rather, the laws cited by the DOJ focus on how domicile is determined and the time periods that allow a person domiciled in Virginia to become eligible for in-state tuition.

The lawsuit offers the following upshot of those guidelines: ""Virginia law permits an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States to qualify for reduced in-state rates and state-administered financial assistance based on residence within the state but does not make United States citizens eligible for such benefits without regard to whether the United States citizens are Virginia residents.""

To hear the DOJ tell it, providing in-state tuition to immigrant residents unlawfully discriminates against out-of-state U.S. citizens.

""That classification makes illegal aliens eligible for reduced in-state tuition and state-administered financial assistance for public state colleges and universities while U.S. citizens from other states are ineligible for the reduced tuition and must pay higher out-of-state tuition rates,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""This is not only wrong but illegal. The challenged act's discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over U.S. citizens is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law.""

The Trump administration argued the UVA domicile policy runs afoul of a section of federal law which, on its own terms, purports to limit ""eligibility for preferential treatment of aliens not lawfully present on basis of residence for higher education benefits.""

The lawsuit cites the relevant language (emphasis in original):

An alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State . . . for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit . . . without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.

It is not enough for the federal government to say the UVA tuition guidelines violate federal law, though they do argue that UVA is violating at least two immigration-related statutes. The DOJ also said UVA tuition guidelines are ""in direct conflict with federal law."" And, closely related to this argument, the DOJ says Virginia encroaches on federal immigration law by trying to take immigration status out of the equation in a third section of the domicile rules.

""Virginia law expressly provides that a student may not be deemed ineligible to establish domicile for in-state tuition purposes solely on the basis of the immigration status of the student's parent,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""As a result, Virginia law affirmatively removes immigration status as a barrier to establishing domicile and obtaining in-state tuition benefits.""

The litigation comes in the form of an as-applied challenge. This means the DOJ does not think Virginia law is broadly unconstitutional. Instead, the federal government is arguing that the in-state tuition guidelines used by UVA are unconstitutional in one specific circumstance: when such pricing is afforded to immigrants.

The federal government says the salve for Virginia's alleged encroachment of federal immigration law is federal preemption of the domicile rules used to determine in-state tuition.

To that end, the lawsuit puts forward a lone avenue of redress: a violation of the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The government's lawsuit also marshals some support from a 2023 case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in which a group of conservative students unsuccessfully attempted to bar the University of North Texas from charging out-of-state tuition.

In that case, the appellate panel declined to grant relief for the out-of-state students but opined separately to say the federal law cited by the students – the same one cited by the Trump administration here – has a ""sole focus…on improper benefits for illegal aliens.""

So, while the lawsuit rhetorically seeks to strike blows for U.S. citizens, the law itself cannot do that under the DOJ's preferred precedent. The Trump administration, instead, is simply trying to get Virginia to stop allowing immigrants to make use of the domicile laws.

""[T]hey confer in-state tuition benefits on unlawfully present aliens that are not available to all United States citizens on the same terms, regardless of residency,"" the lawsuit argues. ""As a result, these provisions, as applied to illegal aliens, are preempted under the Supremacy Clause and are therefore unconstitutional.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Memorial-Day-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:56:50.300692

Here is our primer on the biggest stories to emerge from federal courts in Northern California and the Sacramento region this year.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff arrested in FBI public corruption probe

Dana Williamson, former chief of staff to Newsom and a powerhouse among political aides and lobbyists, was arrested on Nov. 12 and charged with 23 federal counts of bank and wire fraud, filing false tax returns and obstruction of justice. Several of the charges were made in connection with a scheme to funnel money from a campaign account connected to longtime California politician Xavier Becerra to benefit his former chief of staff, Sean McCluskie. Both McCluskie and lobbyist Greg Campbell have pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme.

Federal defendants in Sacramento walked free. The reason: No paid lawyers

In at least eight cases in federal court in Sacramento, judges ruled that defendants’ constitutional rights were violated after the U.S. government stopped paying court-appointed lawyers to represent them. Julian Ortiz, who had faced life in prison for allegedly selling methamphetamine, was released on Dec. 12 after U.S. District Judge John Mendez ruled that without payment, his lawyer could not pay for experts, investigators, translators or others needed to properly research and defend his case. Nationally, about 12,000 private attorneys who rely on the courts to appoint them to represent indigent defendants went without pay for about six months, thanks to the snowballing effect of budget issues, the government shutdown and a computer glitch.

Trump v Newsom: California defiant as policy differences play out in court

From the price of eggs to the deployment of the National Guard, tensions between the Democratic Governor of California and the Republican President played out in federal court in 2025, offering some wins and some losses to each side.

Early in the year, California’s leaders responded defiantly to a threat by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in public safety grants to states and cities that protected migrants under so-called sanctuary policies. San Francisco and Santa Clara sued to stop the action in a case that was quickly joined by numerous cities throughout the country.

Immigration sweeps lead to hard-fought cases on immigration, National Guard

In June, when violent protests erupted over immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, Trump federalized the California National Guard over Newsom’s objections, prompting the first of several lawsuits over an issue that soon went nationwide.

The very next month, immigration sweeps at a South Sacramento Home Depot led to arrests and protests here. Detention of migrants, sometimes violently, at immigration court in Sacramento was detailed in a case filed in federal court in San Jose. But in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Southern California federal judge’s ruling that immigration stops could not be conducted solely based on someone’s apparent ethnicity or job site.

The state also refused to roll back protections for transgender athletes in schools, prompting yet another lawsuit from the Trump administration.

Retired Supreme Court Justice Kennedy reflects on cases, politics, Sacramento boyhood

Among the personalities who shaped the modern political and court system is Sacramento’s own retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. In a rare interview, the 89-year-old sat down with The Bee to talk about the city he loves, his childhood friendships with future luminaries such as the writer Joan Didion, and court decisions that for decades defined him as an influential swing vote on the court.

DHS included a security risk assessment report with the memo that Noem said supports immediate corrective action.

The assessment states the vacant buildings could be accessed by unauthorized individuals and could provide a tactical advantage for small-arms or active-shooter scenarios. The report also warned of threats from ""malicious insiders,"" including employees or contractors with legitimate access who could exploit the vacant buildings to target executives, disrupt operations or compromise sensitive information.

In total, DHS is seeking to demolish 17 buildings. Four have already received approval from federal planning bodies, while the remaining 13 have not been reviewed or approved and are now being pushed through under the emergency demolition designation, according to preservation officials.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that buildings at the site need to be demolished for safety reasons.

""DHS security and safety assessments have determined these dilapidated, vacant buildings pose unacceptable safety, security and emergency-response risks,"" McLaughlin said. ""Demolition is the only permanent corrective action.""

A GSA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the agency was notified by DHS of a serious and immediate security risk at the St. Elizabeths campus.

""Where buildings pose a threat, demolition may be necessary, and we are currently following all applicable laws and regulations,"" GSA spokesperson Marianne Copenhaver said.

Founded in 1855, St. Elizabeths was the nation’s first federally operated psychiatric hospital.

The West Campus was declared ""excess property"" in 2001 and then transferred to the GSA. It was later selected to become DHS’s headquarters and has been redeveloped over the past 15 years into a high-security, fortified complex for DHS, according to the GSA website.

TRUMP ADMIN DEFENDS WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM AS NATIONAL SECURITY MATTER

The site is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with dozens of 19th- and early-20th-century buildings.

The demolition plan has drawn opposition from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the D.C. Preservation League, which argue that DHS has not shown evidence of an actual emergency.

The groups told the Post that the emergency declaration relies solely on Noem’s own determination and bypasses required historic-preservation review procedures for a National Historic Landmark.

""A unilateral declaration like this is problematic because it bypasses the procedural safeguards designed to ensure stability, legitimacy and fairness,"" reads a letter signed by Elizabeth Merritt, the National Trust’s general counsel, and Rebecca Miller, the Preservation League’s executive director, according to the Post.

The preservation groups also argue that DHS used an emergency declaration and holiday timing to compress the review window, leaving little opportunity to challenge the demolition of historic buildings.

DHS declared an emergency on Dec. 19, when Noem signed the memo and security assessment, but GSA did not notify D.C. officials until the evening of Dec. 23, just before the Christmas holiday, per the Post.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/st-elizabths-demolish.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:56:46.490543

There are not enough dangerous criminals in this country to meet the goal of 1 million deportations a year,” expressed Sherman Luna.","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — President Donald Trump said he would deport a million people in his first year in office. According to the Vera Institute of Justice, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detained nearly 6,000 people in Tennessee alone.

In 2025, ICE kicked off its raids in large cities across the country. By May, Nashville was in the bulls-eye. With traffic support from the Tennessee Highway Patrol, ICE began detaining people in South Nashville; the operation ended with 196 arrests.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 95 arrestees had prior criminal convictions and 31 were already removed from the U.S. and “reentered the U.S. illegally,” but the arrests did not end there.

“Right now, the community is at incredible risk. And there is palpable fear throughout the community,” said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director at the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.

Sherman Luna added that the high number of deportations would not be possible without what is known as a 287(g) agreement, which allows local Tennessee law enforcement to work with ICE. Homeland Security calls it a “force multiplier“ in ramping up deportations, but for Sherman Luna, it is a negative. She says Tennessee went from only two 287(g) agreements up to several dozen.

“It is a program that is rife with civil rights violations, that is incredibly costly to local governments, and erodes trust with local law enforcement within the community,” she said. “Now, if you’re an immigrant, you’re not going to call law enforcement when you’ve been a victim of a crime.”

According to arrest data obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE made 800 arrests in Tennessee in October; many of those were in jails. In the Robertson County Jail, ICE detainments went from 18 to 128 in one year. Meanwhile, in Wilson County, they increased from 22 to 110.

Congressman Andy Ogles supports ICE’s operation.

“These countries are literally emptying out their prison, they’re busing them to the Southern border, and then they’re pushing to toward the United States. We literally have been the recipient of the worst of the worst of Africa, South America and Central America because those countries no longer wanted those individuals in their countries so they sent them here. So enough is enough. We’ve got to get very serious about deportations,” said Ogles.

“The reality is that for Trump to carry out his mass deportation agenda, he has to have a broader scope. There are not enough dangerous criminals in this country to meet the goal of 1 million deportations a year,” expressed Sherman Luna.

Arrests in Tennessee have nearly doubled since last year. A DHS website lists what it calls the “worst of the worst.” Looking at Nashville arrests, the list includes Mario Romero-Beltran from El Salvador who was convicted of rape and aggravated assault; Nimia Gamez-Saucedo was convicted of drug trafficking and illegal re-entry; and Jose Herrera-Rivas was convicted of a weapons offense possessing a synthetic narcotic.

“If I have to choose between a migrant from Somalia and our wives, our daughters, our sisters, I’m going to choose to protect you rather than someone like this,” said Ogles.

“Unfortunately, I do think cruelty is at the heart of all this,” said Santiago Mueckey, associate director for advocacy at Vera Institute of Justice.

Mueckey is especially concerned about what happens to the detainees once they are in the system and removed from the public eye.

“The bigger issue is that more than 96% of the people detained in Tennessee are then moved out of state, mostly to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. So not only is this completely destabilizing to communities, to families, but it presents challenges for the individuals who are detained,” added Mueckey.

Mueckey says by moving them out of state, detainees have a hard time connecting with their families and securing a lawyer.

“Out of the close to 6,000 people who have been detained in Tennessee, more than two-thirds of them don’t have legal representation,” he said. “And I keep coming back to legal representation because it really is the last line of defense.”

Looking at the economy locally, according to the Vera Institute, about three quarters of the immigrant population in Davidson County alone takes part in the workforce.",https://www.wkrn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2025/12/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 17:57:54.150039

Under Chhabria's order, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services can share with ICE the basic biographical, contact and location information outlined in his order starting on Jan. 5","A federal judge in California this week allowed officials to share some Medicaid information — including addresses and phone numbers — with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help that agency in its efforts to identify, arrest and deport immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally.

The ruling amounts to a partial legal victory for the Trump administration and its efforts to carry out a deportation operation of unprecedented proportions.

U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria said in an order Monday the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, can receive biographical, contact and location information from the Medicaid program, for immigration enforcement purposes. That can include the immigration status of individuals, their address, phone number and date of birth.

""Congress could not have made a clearer statement about DHS's entitlement to certain data from other agencies, and that entitlement would be meaningless if it did not also obligate agencies to comply with DHS's legitimate data requests,"" Chhabria wrote in his order.

Chhabria said ICE's data requests must be limited to people in the U.S. unlawfully. He blocked the agency from having access to a broader set of Medicaid information, including sensitive medical records and data on American citizens and lawful permanent residents.

Generally speaking, immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for Medicaid or most federal benefits, but states are required to provide emergency care to anyone, regardless of their immigration status. And some Democratic-led states also offer certain health benefits to immigrants who lack legal status.

A group of roughly 20 Democratic-led states, led by California, had challenged the Trump administration's immigration information-sharing effort, saying it will deter immigrants from seeking critical medical care.

The Trump administration, on the other hand, has said the policy will allow officials to better enforce federal immigration law. In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the ruling was a ""victory for the rule of law and American taxpayers.""

""President Trump consistently promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries,"" McLaughlin added. ""To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens, CMS and DHS will ensure that illegal aliens do not receive Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.""

The court rejected the federal government’s conditions, stating that they were not “consistent with Congressional intent or FEMA’s mission.”

“The court saw through FEMA’s attempt to break the law and deny money that North Carolina relies on to respond to hurricanes, natural disasters, and other emergencies,” Jackson said in the release. “Our state is going to get back the $17 million that Congress promised so that our emergency responders and law enforcement officers are ready to respond to the next crisis.”

In Nov., Jackson sued FEMA and DHS for setting “unlawful” terms on grants without congressional approval.

Though multiple courts said these arrests violate the First Amendment, the Department of Homeland Security begs to differ.

While an official count of these arrests is not available, ProPublica tracked at least 130 Americans — including at least 12 elected officials — who’ve been arrested for allegedly interfering with and filming agents.

In the ongoing legal battles about whether or not people can legally film ICE activity in public, at least seven federal courts have ruled that it is a First Amendment right to record law enforcement agents in public.

“If you obstruct or assault our law enforcement, we will hunt you down and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” an unnamed DHS spokesperson told Reason. The publication asked the department if it considers recording or following a law enforcement officer in a public place to be obstruction of justice.

“That sure sounds like obstruction of justice,” the DHS spokesperson said. “Our brave ICE law enforcement face a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them.”

Straight Arrow News contacted DHS to try to clarify the agency’s legal argument, but did not receive a response.

In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared “violence” as being “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at,” she said.

First Amendment right, courts say

Federal courts, including the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th circuits, have ruled that the First Amendment protects the rights of people to record law enforcement agents performing their duties in the public sphere.

Adam Rose, the deputy director of advocacy for Freedom of the Press Foundation, said he’s sat in on courtrooms where the DHS’ attorneys try to argue their point.

“This DHS comment is pro-secret police and anti-American,” Rose told Straight Arrow News. “Using an unnamed spokesperson puts it on the same level as an online troll, so let’s not pretend this has any merit. Filming in public is a fundamental American right, as confirmed by federal appeals courts for decades.”

The department’s email responses to Reason seem to defy federal courts saying that the First Amendment protects the right to record police activity in public spaces.

“It’s one of the most direct public statements yet from DHS articulating a policy that treats following, recording, and revealing the identities of federal immigration officers as illegal activity,” C.J. Ciaramella wrote for Reason.“There have been months of news reports and viral showing federal immigration officers threatening, brandishing weapons, and violently detaining people for following and recording them in public.”

But most of ICE’s citizen arrests for allegedly interfering with or assaulting agents have been dropped, ProPublica reported.

“There’s a reason DHS and its counterparts keep getting humiliated in court when they pretend to be victims,” Rose told SAN. “They’re losing in front of juries, judges are calling them not credible. It’s important not to normalize this absurd language from DHS — their ‘sounds like’ doesn’t mask their intent.”

Powerful player

ICE is positioned to receive more money than any other federal law enforcement agency.

This year, Congress earmarked $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security initiatives, including a $45 billion allocation for immigration detention. Officials plan to increase its detention capacity from a daily average of 41,500 people to at least 100,000, according to Reuters.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ assistant secretary for public affairs, said, “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents… We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

But many courts, organizations and people say that videotaping the agents in public is a First Amendment right.

“There is no doubt that DHS is deliberately threatening people who observe and record their activities,” David J. Bier, the director of immigration studies at Cato Institute, told SAN. “This is an attack on their First Amendment rights as well as accountability when agents violate people’s rights in other ways.”

Cato Institute, a libertarian organization, is among the vocal critics of ICE’s arrests of people for filming law enforcement agents. Cato, alongside groups like the ACLU, says that these arrests are unconstitutional, and that ICE has a “systematic” approach to detaining people who film agents’ arrests.

“[I]t is crucial to understand that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consider people who follow DHS and ICE agents to observe, record, or protest their operations as engaging in ‘impeding,’” Bier wrote in an article for Cato. “DHS has a systematic policy of threatening people who follow ICE or DHS agents to record their activities with detentions, arrests, and violence, and agents have already chased, detained, arrested, charged, struck, and shot at people who follow them.”

The ACLU is another group that is an active opponent of these ICE arrests. Scarlet Kim, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told SAN that it is a core First Amendment right to record publicly visible law enforcement activity.

“It creates an independent record of what officers are doing, and it is no accident that some of the most high-profile cases of misconduct have involved video recordings,” Kim said. “The burning question is why ICE officers feel the need to hide who they are and what they do from the public — masking their faces, lacking visible ID, driving unmarked vehicles, and now attacking those who document their activities.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226092192_Dominic_GwinnGetty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 19:56:20.258130

Likewise, Hasen said, Trump could spread misinformation to undermine confidence in vote tallies, as he has done routinely ahead of elections.","If history is a guide, Republicans stand a good chance of losing control of the House of Representatives in 2026. They have just a slim majority in the chamber, and the incumbent party usually gives up seats in midterm elections.

President Trump, whose loss of the House halfway through his first term led to two impeachments, is trying to keep history from repeating — and doing so in ways his opponents say are intended to manipulate next year’s election landscape.

He has rallied his party to remake congressional maps across the country to create more conservative-leaning House seats, an effort that could end up backfiring on him. He’s directed his administration to target Democratic politicians, activists and donors. And, Democrats worry, he’s flexing his muscles to intervene in the midterms like no administration ever has.

Democrats and other critics point to how Trump has sent the military into Democratic cities over the objections of Democratic mayors and governors. They note that he’s pushed the Department of Homeland Security to be so aggressive that at one point its agents handcuffed a Democratic U.S. senator. And some warn that a Republican-controlled Congress could fail to seat winning candidates if Democrats reclaim the House majority, recalling Trump’s efforts to stay in power even after voters rejected him in 2020, leading to the violent attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol.

Regarding potential military deployments, Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, told the Associated Press: “What he is going to do is send those troops there, and keep them there all the way through the next election, because guess what? If people are afraid of leaving their house, they’re probably not going to leave their house to go vote on Election Day. That’s how he stays in power.”

Military to the polls, or fearmongering?

Democrats sounded similar alarms just before November’s elections, and yet there were no significant incidents. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent Trump antagonist who also warns about a federal crackdown on voting in 2026, predicted that masked immigration agents would show up at the polls in his state, where voters were considering a ballot measure to counter Trump’s redistricting push.

There were no such incidents in November, and the measure to redraw California’s congressional lines in response to Trump’s efforts elsewhere won in a landslide.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the concerns about the midterms come from Democratic politicians who are “fearmongering to score political points with the radical left flank of the Democrat party that they are courting ahead of their doomed-to-fail presidential campaigns.”

She described their concerns as “baseless conspiracy theories.”

Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, denied that Trump was planning to use the military to try to suppress votes.

“I say it is categorically false, will not happen. It’s just wrongheaded,” she told Vanity Fair for an interview that was published earlier in December.

DNC litigation director Dan Freeman said he hasn’t seen an indication that Trump will send immigration enforcement agents to polling places during the midterms, but is wary.

He said the DNC filed public records requests in an attempt to learn more about any such plans and is drafting legal pleadings it could file if Trump sends armed federal agents to the polls or otherwise intervenes in the elections.

“We’re not taking their word for it,” Freeman said in an interview.

States, not presidents, run elections

November’s off-year elections may not be the best indicator of what could lie ahead. They were scattered in a handful of states, and Trump showed only modest interest until late in the fall when his Department of Justice announced it was sending federal monitors to California and New Jersey to observe voting in a handful of counties. It was a bureaucratic step that had no impact on voting, even as it triggered alarm from Democrats.

Alexandra Chandler, the legal director of Defend Democracy, a group that has clashed with Trump over his role in elections, said she was heartened by the lack of drama during the 2025 voting.

“We have so many positive signs we can look to,” Chandler said, citing not only a quiet election but GOP senators’ resistance to Trump’s demands to eliminate the filibuster and the widespread resistance to Trump’s demand that television host Jimmy Kimmel lose his job due to his criticism of the president. “There are limits” on Trump’s power, she noted.

“We will have elections in 2026,” Chandler said. “People don’t have to worry about that.”

Under the Constitution, a president has limited tools to intervene in elections, which are run by the states. Congress can help set rules for federal elections, but states administer their own election operations and oversee the counting of ballots.

When Trump tried to single-handedly revise election rules with a sweeping executive order shortly after returning to office, the courts stepped in and stopped him, citing the lack of a constitutional role for the president. Trump later promised another order, possibly targeting mail ballots and voting machines, but it has yet to materialize.

DOJ voter data request ‘should frighten everybody’

Still, there’s plenty of ways a president can cause problems, said Rick Hasen, a UCLA law professor.

Trump unsuccessfully pushed Georgia’s top election official to “find” him enough votes to be declared the winner there in 2020 and could try similar tactics in Republican-dominated states in November. Likewise, Hasen said, Trump could spread misinformation to undermine confidence in vote tallies, as he has done routinely ahead of elections.

It’s harder to do that in more lopsided contests, as many in 2025 turned into, Hasen noted.

“Concerns about Trump interfering in 2026 are real; they’re not frivolous,” Hasen said. “They’re also not likely, but these are things people need to be on guard for.”

One administration move that has alarmed election officials is a federal demand from his Department of Justice for detailed voter data from the states. The administration has sued the District of Columbia and at least 21 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, after they refused to turn over all the information the DOJ sought.

“What the DOJ is trying to do is something that should frighten everybody across the political spectrum,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting rights attorney and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. “They’re trying to use the power of the executive to bully states into turning over highly sensitive data — date of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license, the Holy Trinity of identity theft — hand it over to the DOJ for who knows what use.”

‘Voter protection’ versus ‘election integrity’

Voting rights lawyers and election officials have been preparing for months for the midterms, trying to ensure there are ways to counter misinformation and ensure state election systems are easy to explain. Both major parties are expected to stand up significant campaigns around the mechanics of voting: Democrats mounting what they call a “voter protection” effort to monitor for problems while Republicans focus on what they call “election integrity.”

Freeman, the DNC litigation director who previously worked in the DOJ’s voting section, said his hiring this year was part of a larger effort by the DNC to beef up its in-house legal efforts ahead of the midterms. He said the committee has been filling gaps in voting rights law enforcement that the DOJ has typically covered, including informing states that they can’t illegally purge citizens from their voter rolls.

Tina Barton, co-chair of the Committee for Safe & Secure Elections, a coalition of law enforcement and election officials who advise jurisdictions on deescalation and how to respond to emergencies at polling places, says interest in the group’s trainings has “exploded” in recent weeks.

“There’s a lot at stake, and that’s going to cause a lot of emotions,” Barton said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/166dfe2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7402x3886+0+524/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F9a%2F3dc380d046cba1b90269841ab2e8%2Ff33eee354ef14343be819efae9d9d415.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 16:12:26.361645

The complaint cites federal law that states, “an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State … for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.”

I’m only suggesting the issues surrounding the detention and release of illegal entrants are not as clear-cut as all those jurists believe.","Judge Robert Pitman of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (W.D. Tex.) issued an order last week in Siac Guzman v. Bondi, directing DHS to release from immigration custody an alien who entered illegally 19 years ago and who was arrested at his home on Halloween. Such orders have been commonplace since DHS changed its detention policies earlier this year, but are they correct? The answer likely isn’t as clear cut as a lot of jurists seem to believe.

Section 235(b) versus Section 236(a)

Section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) permits immigration officers to arrest aliens on administrative warrants “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States”.

Once they are arrested, section 236(a) gives immigration officers three options: (1) to “continue to detain the arrested alien”; (2) to release the alien on a bond of not less than $1,500; or (3) to release the alien under a little-used authority known as “conditional parole”, which is different from the more commonly utilized “parole” under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA.

Certain aliens arrested on warrant under section 236(a) of the INA are not eligible for release, however.

Specifically, section 236(c) of the INA bars the release of any alien inadmissible on the criminal grounds of removal in section 212(a)(2) of the INA and the “security and related” grounds in section 212(a)(3) of the INA, as well as certain aliens who are deportable under the criminal grounds in section 237(a)(2) and security grounds in section 237(a)(4) of the INA.

Finally, an amendment to section 236(c) in Pub. L. 119-1, the “Laken Riley Act”, bars the release of aliens inadmissible because they are “present without admission or parole” under section 212(a)(6)(A) of the INA, because they sought admission through fraud under section 212(a)(6)(C) of the INA, or because they lack proper entry documents under section 212(a)(7) of the INA who have been “charged with”, “arrested for”, or “convicted of”, or who “admits having committed, or admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of” certain crimes.

So far, so good.

The problem is a different section of the INA: Section 235 (which I refer to as the “inspection protocol”) mandates the detention of all “applicants for admission” to the United States and thus is seemingly at odds with the release provisions in section 236(a) of the INA.

“Admission” is defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA as “the lawful entry of [an] alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer”, while section 235(a)(1) of the INA” defines “applicant seeking admission” as:

An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) . . ..

More specifically (and importantly), section 235(a)(1) of the INA defines that term “for purposes of” title II, chapter 4 of the INA – which includes section 236(a).

In any event, the inspection protocol gives immigration officers two options for dealing with applicants for admission who are removable under 212(a)(6)(C) for seeking admission through fraud or who lack proper entry documents and therefore are removable under section 212(a)(7) of the INA.

Under section 235(b)(1), immigration officers can subject such aliens to “expedited removal”, which permits the immigration officers to issue a removal order to such alien provided the alien hasn’t been found to have a “credible fear” of persecution or torture.

If DHS goes that route, section 235(b)(1) of the INA mandates that the alien be detained “pending a final determination of credible fear of persecution and, if found not to have such a fear, until removed”, and also requires DHS to detain aliens who were subject to expedited removal but found to have a credible fear pending “further consideration of the application for asylum” by an immigration judge.

Alternatively, section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA permits immigration officers to process those aliens subject to removal under sections 212(a)(6)(C) and 212(a)(7) of the INA the same way it deals with every other inadmissible “applicant for admission” by placing them into removal proceedings (under section 240 of the INA) before an immigration judge.

Again, however, section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA mandates those aliens also be detained, as is clear from the language therein, which states in pertinent part:

in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section [240 of the INA]. [Emphasis added.]

I’ll explain the highlights below, but for now just keep them in mind.

There is one more wrinkle to add to this analysis.

“Expedited removal” under section 235(b)(1) of the INA only applies to aliens encountered by CBP at the borders and the ports, and – at the executive branch’s option pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the INA – to any other alien who is removable under sections 212(a)(6)(C) or 212(a)(7) who:

has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph. [Emphasis added.]

That highlight will also be explained below.

DHS Changes Its Detention Interpretation, and EOIR Follows Suit

The inspection protocol in section 235 was added to the INA by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), and for 29 years thereafter various administrations offered differing opinions on how the detention mandates therein were to be applied.

In its 2005 opinion in Matter of X-K-, for example, the BIA held that aliens subject to expedited removal who were placed into section 240 removal proceedings before an immigration judge following a credible fear finding were eligible for release on bond.

That was plainly at odds with the language of section 235(b)(1), but it wasn’t until more than a year after the Supreme Court concluded in its 2018 opinion in Jennings v. Rodriguez that aliens detained under sections 235(b)(1)(B)(ii) and 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA aren’t entitled to EOIR bond redeterminations that then-AG William Barr issued his own opinion (Matter of M-S-) overruling Matter of X-K-.

One constant interpretation throughout that period, however, was that aliens who entered illegally, evaded apprehension, and were arrested in the interior were eligible for bond under section 236(a) of the INA.

That changed, however, in July when acting ICE Director Todd Lyons issued a memo (as yet unpublished) “declar[ing] that immigrants who arrived in the United States illegally are no longer eligible for a bond hearing as they fight deportation proceedings in court”.

Thereafter, in September, the BIA issued an opinion in Matter of Yajure-Hurtado concluding that illegal entrants remain “applicants for admission” up to the point they’re either admitted or removed and therefore remain subject to mandatory detention under section 235(b) of the INA – essentially blessing Lyons’s interpretation.

Siac Guzman v. Bondi

That brings me to Judge Pitman’s recent order in Siac Guzman, which largely focuses on the tension between discretionary release in section 236(a) of the INA and mandatory detention under 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA.

The court concedes that the term “applicant for admission” in section 235(a)(1) of the INA “would be a broad enough category to include an individual like” Siac Guzman, “who was not admitted to the United States, regardless of how long” he has “resided in the United States”.

In other words, the judge found that Siac Guzman is subject to the inspection protocol.

But Judge Pitman concluded the alien is not subject to mandatory detention under section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA even though he’s an applicant for admission.

That’s because, the court found, Siac Guzman is not also “seeking admission”, a ""requirement” Judge Pitman reads “to mean a noncitizen [sic] present in the United States without admission who has recently arrived and is actively seeking admission, not a noncitizen [sic] who has been residing in the country for years”. (Emphasis in the original.)

Judge Pitman is not alone in reaching that conclusion, and in fact cites to a series of recent district court decisions issued post-Matter of Yajure-Hurtado that make the same finding, all premised on the conclusion that the phrase “seeking admission” in section 235(b)(2)(A) must mean something.

IIRIRA and the “Entry Doctrine”

Respectfully, however, that interpretation of section 235(b)(2)(A) ignores the history of that provision, and in particular what Congress was attempting to accomplish when it created the inspection protocol.

I’ve explained that history in-depth elsewhere, but briefly, IIRIRA was intended to eliminate a convoluted sorting process then in existence known as the “entry doctrine”.

Pursuant to that doctrine, if an alien like Siac Guzman had entered illegally “free from official restraint”, he’d be placed into deportation proceedings and would receive a broad range of procedural rights.

If an alien crossed illegally while actively pursued by an immigration officer and was apprehended, however, the alien would be placed into exclusion proceedings, with few constitutional protections.

The entry doctrine invited a lot of unnecessary litigation (check out the BIA’s opinion in Matter of G-, and you’ll understand), and so Congress in IIRIRA replaced “deportation” and “exclusion” proceedings with one unified process – “removal proceedings” under section 240 of the INA – and treated every alien who hasn’t been “admitted” as an “applicant for admission”.

“Seeking Admission”

In so doing, Congress created a legal fiction under which even illegal entrants were “applicants for admission” even though – by evading inspection at the ports – applying for “admission” as defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA was the last thing they intended.

Given that, no illegal entrant could be found to be “actively seeking admission”, and Judge Pitman’s logic would, expedited removal aside, scuttle the inspection protocol entirely, and frustrate Congress’s intentions in amending section 235 in IIRIRA.

Moreover, there is no limiting principle to the W.D. Tex.’s logic. At what point does “recently arrived” end, and where? Does it expire in a day, a week, a month? If an alien crosses illegally at Juarez and immediately hops a flight to Maine at El Paso, could the alien be stopped four hours later at the arrival airport and detained?

Such fine parsing is why IIRIRA ended the entry doctrine, but if Congress had the intention Judge Pitman ascribes to it, it would have defined the term “alien seeking admission” as it did with “admission” and “applicant seeking admission”.

Congress didn’t, and therefore the only way that term can logically be read in section 235(b)(2)(A) is in the context of the phrase as a whole, “an alien seeking admission” who “is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted”, and in the context of section 240(c)(2)(A) of the INA, which places the burden on an “applicant for admission” to prove “the alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section” 212 of the INA.

Simply put, if “aliens seeking admission” have shown they are not inadmissible during the inspection process, Congress in section 235(b)(2)(A) is saying that they are to be admitted, not detained. It’s only when they fail to do so that the detention mandate kicks in.

That’s the most logical interpretation, and the only one that doesn’t actively subvert Congress’s intentions in the rest of section 235.

The Section 236 Conundrum

That still leaves the issue of sections 236(a) and (c), the former permitting the discretionary release of certain aliens and the latter barring the release of certain (criminal and security-risk) aliens who are removable under section 212 of the INA.

One could argue that only aliens who haven’t been admitted, and who are therefore “applicants for admission” under section 235(a)(1) can be subject to inadmissibility under section 212, and that Congress thus didn’t intend the detention mandate in section 235(b)(2)(A) to apply to every applicant for admission.

There are two flaws in that logic, however.

First, aliens who have been paroled under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the INA are not subject to detention under section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA but could still be – or become – removable under the section 212 grounds of inadmissibility listed in section 236(c) (with one exception I’ll discuss below).

Given that, by my estimate, nearly 2.9 million “applicants for admission” were paroled under the Biden administration, a provision mandating their detention in specific instances would be logical.

The sole reference in section 236(c) that would undermine that conclusion is to aliens inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(A) – because they have neither been “admitted” nor “paroled” – who committed certain criminal offenses.

As noted above, that reference was added (on January 29) by the Laken Riley Act – an important point for two reasons: (1) that act was intended to force DHS to detain aliens, not release them; and (2) at that point, neither DHS nor EOIR read section 235(b)(2)(A) as mandating the detention of every illegal entrant encountered in the interior.

Congress is presumed to know how a law has been interpreted when it is amended, and therefore it’s logical to conclude the drafters of the Laken Riley Act specifically mandated the detention of alien criminals who hadn’t been admitted or paroled to ensure they would be detained.

The second flaw is that redundant detention provisions aren’t uncommon in the INA. Notably, section 241(a)(2)(A) of the INA mandates the detention of all aliens under final orders of removal and then states that “[u]nder no circumstance” shall an alien ordered removed on criminal grounds be released.

Doubling down on the detention of an alien who is an “applicant for admission” (section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA) who has committed certain criminal acts (section 236(c)(1)(E) of the INA) would be consistent with Congress’s double-detention mandate for criminals in section 241(a)(2)(A).

“Inconsistency with Prior Pronouncements”

Finally, Judge Pitman argues that the BIA’s “inconsistency” in Matter of Yajure-Hurtado “with prior pronouncements reduces even its ‘power to persuade’”.

With due respect to both the W.D. Tex. and EOIR, the BIA has a spotty record in interpreting the detention mandates in section 235 of the INA.

As noted above, the BIA misapplied the detention mandates in section 235(b)(1) of the INA in Matter of X-K- for 14 years before AG Barr issued Matter of M-S-, even though Matter of X-K- was wildly at odds with the language of the statute – a fact even I realized when I was an immigration judge, but was powerless to correct.

In fact, it wasn’t until the Supreme Court read the language of the statute plainly in Jennings that AG Barr corrected the Board’s erroneous interpretation.

“An Error Does Not Become Truth by Reason of Multiplied Propagation”

To quote Judge Dolly Gee’s 2015 order in Flores v. Lynch (quoting Gandhi): “An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it.”

If that’s true with respect to the release of tens of thousands of alien families (at issue in Flores), it must also be true when applied to the detention of illegal entrant “applicants for admission” as well.

None of this is to call out Judge Pitman; his is one of at least a hundred district court orders rejecting Trump II’s interpretation of the detention mandate for illegal entrant “applicants for admission” in section 235(b)(2)(A) of the INA.

Earlier this year, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, sued Vought, and ultimately secured an order from Jackson that stopped the administration from dismantling the consumer watchdog, and blocked mass firings.
Today, she added that Vought’s argument is “not a valid justification for the agency’s unilateral decision to abandon its obligations under the injunction”.
Jackson’s ruling comes just days before the agency was set to run out of the funding necessary to pay employees.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Jackson’s decision.","A federal judge has ordered that the Trump administration must allow funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to continue.

The watchdog, which supporters say protects US consumers from financial harm by powerful banks, lenders and corporations, is at risk of collapsing after Donald Trump vowed to shutter it since he returned to office this year.

The agency’s acting director, Russell Vought, said that since the Federal Reserve has been operating at a loss, it is unable to fund the CFPB.

In a 32-page decision, DC district judge Amy Berman Jackson said that this novel workaround by the Trump administration to “starve” the agency of funding was “manufactured by the defendants” and based solely on an office of legal counsel memo, which said that there were no “combined earnings” available from the Fed for the CFPB – since the agency doesn’t receive its appropriations from Congress.

Earlier this year, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, sued Vought, and ultimately secured an order from Jackson that stopped the administration from dismantling the consumer watchdog, and blocked mass firings. Today, she added that Vought’s argument is “not a valid justification for the agency’s unilateral decision to abandon its obligations under the injunction”.

She added that funding for the agency has continued “seamlessly” since the bureau was established in 2011, “even in the years since 2022 when the Federal Reserve’s interest expenses have exceeded its earnings”.

The US court of appeals for the DC circuit upheld Jackson’s earlier injunction and is set to hear the case on the administration’s wider attempt to dismantle the entire CFPB in February 2026. “The only new circumstance is the administration’s determination to eliminate an agency created by Congress with the stroke of pen, even while the matter is before the Court of Appeals,” Jackson wrote in today’s order, describing it as “yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court’s injunction was put in place to prevent”.

Jackson’s ruling comes just days before the agency was set to run out of the funding necessary to pay employees. In response, Elizabeth Warren – the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee – praised Tuesday’s decision. “If courts continue to uphold the law, they’ll keep blocking Russ Vought’s illegal attempts to ‘close down’ the agency that has returned $21bn directly to Americans who were cheated by big banks and giant corporations,” she said.

Topline:

President Donald Trump focused on California first as his administration rolled out its crackdown on unauthorized immigration, sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and carrying out high profile raids throughout the state.

Why it matters: Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

What's next: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity.

Read on... for more on what happened in 2025 and what to expect in the coming year.

In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.

Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods.

Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home.

Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority.

All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.

A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside.

A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems.

Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories.

2026 outlook

California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity. School districts and employers are preparing for more mass removals, while lawmakers are considering new privacy protections.

For more than a century, the Rose Parade has delighted audiences across Southern California with its colorful, elaborate floats and fanfare.

The parade will celebrate its 137th year when floats begin traveling through Pasadena at 8 a.m. Jan. 1, 2026. This year's theme is ""Magic in Teamwork,"" and Magic Johnson is the Grand Marshal.

This year, for the first time in two decades, rain appears to be highly likely on parade day. Rain conditions are rare for the legendary parade.

Showing off SoCal weather, in fact, was one of the main drivers of the parade's creation.

As the Pasadena Tournament of Roses website recounts, Charles F. Holder led Valley Hunt Club members in creating the parade in 1890, saying: “In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let’s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.”

Nearly one year after fires destroyed thousands of homes in L.A. County, many families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors. That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published this morning.

The numbers: Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

The context: Investor activity is common following disasters. While some say they can be helpful in bringing homes back to ravaged communities, others are skeptical about their plans. Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development in Altadena.

Read on… to learn why one Altadena fire survivor sees this trend as “disaster capitalism” coming for the diverse foothill community.

Shortly after the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes in and around Altadena, signs sprung up across the community announcing “Altadena is not for sale.”

Now, nearly one year later, hundreds of Altadena families have concluded that rebuilding isn’t in their budget. In nearly half of recent deals for empty lots, homeowners are selling to investors.

That’s the conclusion researchers with the online real estate listings platform Redfin reached in a new report published Tuesday.

Analyzing transactions in L.A. County burn zones during July, August and September, they found that about 40% of Pacific Palisades vacant lots went to corporate buyers. In both Altadena and Malibu, about 44% of such vacant lot sales went to investors.

“It's not uncommon to see that when disasters hit a place, investors come in,” said Sheharyar Bokhari, Redfin’s principal economist. “It's hard to value a vacant lot, so you could perhaps buy lower than what it should sell for and then flip it.”

More vacant lots are getting scooped up

To conduct the analysis, Redfin researchers looked at sales in the zip codes 90272 for the Pacific Palisades, 91001 for Altadena and 90265 for Malibu. They categorized buyers as investors if their names contained words or abbreviations such as LLC, Inc, Corp or Homes.

There was a marked increase of vacant lots sales in all communities, according to the report. In the Pacific Palisades, 119 lots sold in July, August and September. Altadena saw 61 lot sales. In 2024, before the fires, neither Pacific Palisades nor Altadena had any lots selling in those months.

Malibu saw some vacant lots sell in that time frame in 2024. But before the fires, only about 21% of those sales were to investors.

The findings are similar to those in a separate report published in October by the nonprofit Strategic Actions for a Just Economy. That report found that 49% of sales in the Eaton Fire burn zone went to corporate entities.

Zaire Calvin lost his family’s home in Altadena and had a sister who died in the fire. He said the trend shows “disaster capitalism” poised to change the diverse foothill community.

“If rebuilding becomes a race for capital instead of a return home for families, then disaster has been basically repackaged as opportunity for those with the most resources,” Calvin said. “It's like they're preying on us while we're still praying for hope and help.”

Some lawmakers and organizations have been working to counteract speculative development..

Assembly Bill 851, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in October, outlawed unsolicited offers on properties in burn zones until 2027.

The nonprofit Greenline Housing Foundation has been buying lots from distressed sellers in Altadena, giving them an alternative to more bottom-line driven investors. The organization has said it intends to rebuild homes and sell them at below market prices to first-time buyers.

Corporate buyers: disaster capitalists or helpful rebuilders?

Bokhari, the Redfin economist, said investor activity is not entirely detrimental to communities recovering from disaster.

“Investors who have a lot more capital can come in and build that community,” he said. They can afford to clean up lingering environmental damage and build homes that comply with the latest fire safety codes, he said.

“Investors play that role in bringing back those homes,” Bokhari said.

Still, uncertainty around investors’ plans have left many Altadenans anxious. Will homes be for sale or for rent? How will those homes look? Will investor-built properties give Black families a way to continue building generational wealth in a historically Black corner of L.A. County?

Lori Gay, president and CEO of Neighborhood Housing Services of L.A. County, said in the grand scheme of L.A. real estate, not many lots in Altadena are trading hands so far. Only 61 lots in the community sold in July, August and September according to the Redfin report.

“More will go up for sale over time,” Gay said. But in her organization’s work advising families on how to rebuild, she said, “Most families we’ve seen want to go back home. They’re not trying to leave. They’re trying to figure out how to stay.”

Good Tuesday morning. I’m Kimberly Leonard, guest-writing Playbook from sunny Miami, where I live and write Florida Playbook. Get in touch.

DRIVING THE DAY

AN (ALMOST) CONGRESSIONAL ARRAIGNMENT: The now-postponed arraignment for Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida could have been just a short, humdrum court proceeding. But the scene that unfolded outside the C. Clyde Atkins U.S. Courthouse in Miami yesterday became so much more as multiple political storylines converged.

A dozen journalists surrounded Cherfilus-McCormick as she entered the federal courthouse with her husband and lawyers just across the street from where President Donald Trump had faced his own arraignment over classified documents in 2023.

Cherfilus-McCormick, 46, has been charged with allegedly stealing $5 million in overpaid federal disaster funds — then using the money toward her congressional campaign and a 3.14-carat yellow diamond ring. (There was no stone in sight yesterday.)

As they walked up the courthouse steps, the member of Congress and her lawyers ignored questions from Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. Holding a mic and accompanied by a cameraperson, he demanded to know why her indictment should be treated differently from that of former GOP Rep. George Santos of New York, whose colleagues expelled him from Congress following numerous criminal charges including misuse of campaign funds. (He was eventually sentenced for wire fraud and identity theft.)

Tarrio told Playbook the scene reminded him of his own initial court appearance in Miami that resulted in a 22-year sentence in DC for seditious conspiracy for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection.

In a January 2022 interview with PBS News, Cherfilus-McCormick accused the Proud Boys of trying to intimidate Black voters at her special election.

“On a personal level it’s sweet justice,” Tarrio said, referring to how Democrats publicized his sentencing. Trump pardoned Tarrio in January.

The drama inside the courtroom was more subdued, playing out in less than five minutes. Magistrate Judge Lisette Reid gave the member of Congress the three more weeks her lawyer, David Markus, said she needed to officially retain his legal team, and the arraignment got bumped to Jan. 20, 2026. While that punted Cherfilus-McCormick’s official plea, she has repeatedly said she’s innocent, including yesterday.

Markus is the same lawyer representing Ghislaine Maxwell in ongoing legal matters stemming from her conviction for involvement in her late boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network. But it was what Markus said upon exiting the courthouse that drove the day’s news: He accused “folks within the Florida Democratic Party” of targeting his client and said his team would be “exposing” those involved. He didn’t elaborate.

Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried notably hasn’t weighed in on the indictment. Yet the comments about possible intraparty strife come just as the beleaguered state party had otherwise ended the year with glimmers of hope after a Democrat was elected Miami mayor.

Cherfilus-McCormick’s seat is safely blue. Trump lost it by nearly 40 points in 2024, according to the Downballot. But her charges and claims of her own party’s involvement threaten to distract Florida Democrats as they go up against a much better-funded and organized Florida GOP, especially as national Democrats warn that failing to compete in the South could make a future presidential victory nearly impossible.

Former Broward County Mayor Dale Holness, who lost the Democratic nomination to Cherfilus-McCormick in 2021 by five votes, said candidates should be focused on affordability and stressed he viewed the state party as “working hard to rebuild itself.”

“Everyone deserves their day in court,” said Holness, who’s among those running for the seat again. “I don’t know the spin the attorney is putting on it now.”

If convicted, Cherfilus-McCormick is facing more than five decades in prison. She’s the only member of Congress of Haitian descent and has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s travel ban and immigration restrictions. Florida has half a million residents with ties to Haiti, which is facing gang violence and political instability.

While Cherfilus-McCormick stepped down from her subcommittee leadership role, some Florida Republicans have called for her to be expelled, pointing to Santos’ 2023 ouster.

Santos — who’s moving to Florida fresh off the heels of a Trump clemency — agrees. “I was denied due process and that is the standard that was set by the House,” he said. “I don’t like it — but fair is fair. She needs to go.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. DEEP DIVE: POLITICO’s Daniel Lippman, Sophia Cai and Daniel Barnes have an in-depth story this morning about how Paul Ingrassia has survived in the Trump administration. The 30-year-old lawyer pulled his nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel after POLITICO reported that he said he has a “Nazi streak,” according to texts. He is now the acting general counsel at the General Services Administration, after two previous jobs as White House liaison to DOJ and DHS.

“His almost Trumpian survival demonstrates how ideological affinity and personal loyalty can outweigh all other considerations in this administration,” the authors write. “And while top officials in the Republican Party and White House have split between denouncing bigoted language exhibited by officials like Ingrassia and forming a defensive line around supporters, the messages don’t appear to have hurt his official standing.” A lawyer for Ingrassia did not confirm the texts were authentic and said at the time they “could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted.” The lawyer and Ingrassia did not comment for this story.

2. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Bowl blitz: Abdul El-Sayed’s campaign for the U.S. Senate in Michigan is airing the last of its football-themed, nearly six-figure statewide ads during the Citrus Bowl on New Year’s Eve, which will see Texas take on the University of Michigan, El-Sayed’s alma mater. In promoting the ad, which features him throwing the pigskin, El-Sayed’s campaign said that “College football remains one of the last places where Michiganders can come together across political divides, age, and background.”

But El-Sayed, who captained his high school football team, has expressed a more complicated relationship with the game in the past, Playbook’s Adam Wren reports. In his now private Substack called “The Incision,” EL-Sayed wrote of the “toxic masculinity at the heart of America’s most popular sport.” He also wrote that “on the sidelines and in the locker room, I was fed a hefty dose of the worst kinds of racist taunting. On an episode of the podcast “America Dissected,” El-Sayed said football “takes some of the most egregious narratives that we tell ourselves about who we are as a country. And it puts it on the field every Sunday.”

Asked for comment, an El-Sayed spokesperson said: “Abdul’s love of football isn’t theoretical. It’s up close and personal, earned snap after snap and tackle after tackle. Football taught him so much about leadership and community — but also about the risks and who bears them. Abdul knows that loving something means pushing it to be better. That’s the same approach he’ll bring to the U.S. Senate: identify the problem honestly and directly so we can find real solutions, and then fight to make things better for everyone, not just the people at the top.”

3. VENEZUELA VEX: The CIA carried out a drone strike earlier this month on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela — marking the first known attack inside the country and a major escalation of the administration’s pressure campaign, CNN’s Natasha Bertrand and colleagues scoop. The strike targeted the dock believed to be storing drugs, and there were no casualties. The report came after Trump told reporters yesterday about hitting a facility, calling it a “major explosion” but remaining mum on details, per WSJ’s Dustin Volz. And on the oil front, the squeeze on Venezuela via the blockade is causing the country to shutter some of its oil wells, as they run out of storage space, per Bloomberg.

4. WAR AND PEACE: Despite simmering tensions on the way forward on Gaza and Iran, Trump and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu projected a united front while doling out the usual praise for each other, NYT’s Tyler Pager and David Halbfinger report. Little was said publicly about their talks over the multi-course lunch at Mar-a-Lago, including on how the Gaza peace plan will advance into the second phase. Trump did heap some pressure on Hamas, saying they have a “very short period of time” to disarm, adding there will be “hell to pay” if they don’t, per Bloomberg.

Trump’s strongest commitment was on Iran, stating he will back more strikes on the country should they rebuild their nuclear capabilities, POLITICO’s Alex Gangitano writes from Palm Beach. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down,” Trump said. He added that he heard Iran may want to make a deal, but otherwise he would support an Israeli strike. Trump also paid reporters a surprise visit on the Mar-a-Lago patio, Alex writes in to Playbook. He pointed to an area where there was the family of Ran Gvili, a deceased hostage in Gaza. “They’re waiting for their son to come home. From Israel. Their son is a very brave soldier and that’s the only body.” His mother said they are going to bring her son home.

Trump’s other headache: After a hopeful meeting this weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy where Trump declared a peace deal could be “very close,” Russia is once again throwing cold water on the prospect, POLITICO’s Eli Stokols and Diana Nerozzi write. The Kremlin vowed to turn up hostilities after an attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s property. The latest disagreement signals the sides remain far apart on peace, Eli and Diana write.

5. HEALTH OF A NATION: “Trump admin doles out billions for rural health,” by POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein and Ruth Reader: “The Trump administration on Monday doled out billions to states from a fund Congress created to ‘transform; rural health care. The funds, however, will be lavished more generously on small states and states that adopt administration friendly policies. … [CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz] said disbursements for states are between $145 million and $281 million for 2026, amounts largely driven by how large a state’s rural population is. … even fans of the program stress that it won’t come close to making up for the deep cuts to Medicaid that states are bracing for in 2026.”

The bigger picture: “Inside RFK Jr.’s reshaping of public health in Trump’s first year,” by WaPo’s Rachel Roubein and colleagues: “Interviews with almost 100 people reveal how Kennedy, as health secretary, has reshaped the vaccine and broader public health infrastructure in less than a year.”

6. 2026 WATCH: With current members of Congress weighing reelection, “the direction of travel is toward the door,” but there’s another growing trend: former members looking to come back, WaPo’s Anna Liss-Roy writes. At least 18 former members are jockeying to win back a seat. And the reaction from current lawmakers is telling: “I’ve had so many members ask me if I need a wellness check,” Ben McAdams said. “They’re like, ‘Cori, we love that you’re running again, but why would you want to come back? You’re free,’” Cori Bush told WaPo. For a running tally of all the retirees in Congress next year, AP has you covered.

Redistricting rodeo: The new maps approved in California made some districts more competitive for Democrats, and now they’re intensifying the Democratic Party’s civil war about which faction should carry its mantle — moderates or progressives, POLITICO’s Blake Jones reports. And in Rep. David Valadao’s (R-Calif.) district, NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s team is crafting Democrat Randy Villegas’ media strategy and “going for the jugular.” … Next up, Utah’s state Republican lawmakers will appeal to the state’s Supreme Court which could determine the future of its maps, per Deseret News’ Brigham Tomco.

Happening tonight: Iowa’s special state Senate election. Should Republicans take the Democratic-leaning district, they’ll regain a supermajority and secure their control on state government, per AP.

7. LIVE FROM NEW YORK: “The Making of Mayor Mamdani,” by NY Mag’s David Freedlander: “Mamdani’s revolution, in this moment before he takes office, has two defining qualities. The first is the well-known movement-building skill of the man. …The second is a certain sense of unreality — a tension between what he promises he will do and what the normal laws of political physics would seem to allow. … The two qualities — the scintillating political skill and the strangeness of a 34-year-old democratic socialist just a few years removed from a music career taking control and pledging enormous changes without meaningful compromise — exist side by side, and how they resolve will define Mamdani’s mayoralty.”

8. IMMIGRATION FILES: A federal judge ruled yesterday that the Trump administration can move forward with sharing location data on undocumented immigrants receiving public health benefits with ICE officials, starting Jan. 6, POLITICO’s Tyler Katzenberger reports. The ruling is a victory for Trump’s push for mass deportations, and a significant setback for Califonia AG Rob Bonta and the Democratic attorneys general who sued back in July.

Deportation drive: “The Trump administration’s plan to close a ‘huge loophole’ in legal immigration,” by POLITICO’s Myah Ward and Eric Bazail-Eimil: “The Trump administration’s strategy was bolstered in October when the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative body that oversees immigration courts, said judges should weigh third-country removal before an asylum case is considered in the U.S. … in November, DHS attorneys asked judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases, more than twice the amount in October and four times the amount in September … Immigration attorneys and advocates, alarmed by the latest trend, argue that it’s a further erosion of the U.S. asylum system in the United States.”

ICE told Fox News they're on the ground in Minneapolis investigating allegations of fraud involving child care centers, as authorities follow a sprawling money trail that federal prosecutors say could ultimately total more than $9 billion.

""We're learning a lot,"" ICE Director Todd Lyons told ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday.

Lyons shared that the agency is looking into possible criminal and terrorist ties overseas, adding that the probe speaks to the breadth of ICE's work.

""[We're] going with criminal warrants to conduct these investigations,"" he said.

""All too often you hear that ICE is just out there terrorizing the community or conducting administrative work. We've been on the ground in Minnesota conducting criminal investigations and Homeland Security investigations [and have] gone door to door to a lot of these suspected fraud sites all over St. Paul and Minnesota.""

The investigation follows widespread fraud allegations, including ones stemming from a viral video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley showing visits to several Minnesota daycare facilities, including Quality Learning Center in Minneapolis, which appeared inactive during the visit despite receiving state childcare assistance funds.

Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families Commissioner Tikki Brown said during a Monday news conference that prior inspections of the sites – which occurred at random and within the last six months – did not uncover fraud and children were active at the sites.

Brown additionally acknowledged questions about the timing of the video visits, noting that regulators are seeking clarity on whether footage was recorded during operating hours or on days when centers were scheduled to be open.

""While we have questions about some of the methods that were used in the video, we do take the concerns that the video raises about fraud very seriously,"" she said.

A spokesperson for Gov. Tim Walz also addressed the swath of fraud allegations plaguing the state, saying, ""The governor has worked for years to crack down on fraud and asked the state legislator for more authority to take aggressive action. He has strengthened oversight.""

Lyons criticized Minnesota's policies, alleging that ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions allow bad actors to ""hide in plain sight"" and commit crimes.

In today’s issue:

▪ Trump admin targets Minnesota

▪ Trump consumed with foreign policy

▪ U.S. strikes facility in Venezuela

▪ Iowa state Senate election

A fraud scandal plaguing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) has drawn the ire of many Republicans and those in the Trump administration, The Hill’s Sarah Fortinsky reports. The state and its governor are facing national backlash following a viral video that made headlines showing a day care facility that appeared inactive despite receiving significant funding.

This comes amid an already launched investigation into the state’s safety net programs.

And on Monday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said she sent agents door to door at suspected fraud sites as part of the broader investigation launched earlier this month.

“DHS is on the ground in Minneapolis, going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites. The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found,” readsa post from DHS’s account on social platform X.

The viral video, released Friday by independent journalist Nick Shirley, renewed scrutiny of the governor’s handling of widespread fraud occurring in some state-run programs, Fortinsky reports.

Many have sought to blame the Democratic governor for failing to sufficiently crack down on the issue, while Walz’s office has sought to defend the governor’s handling of the situation.

A spokesperson for the governor said they have “hired an outside firm to audit payments to high-risk programs, shut down the Housing Stabilization Services program entirely, announced a new statewide program integrity director, and supported criminal prosecutions.”

Walz has criticized the administration’s actions but has said consistently that anyone committing fraud should go to prison.

Additionally, Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Kelly Loeffler said Monday on X that she is pausing annual funding to Minnesota while the SBA investigates fraud.

Leading the Day

TRUMP’S YEAR-END POLICY FOCUS: Trumphas spent the last week of the year focused on foreign policy while residing at Mar-a-Lago, where he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the war with Russia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss ongoing peace efforts in Gaza, disarming Hamas, strikes in Iran and an “understanding” regarding Syria.

He announced military strikes against ISIS in Nigeria on Christmas Day and revealed he targeted a Venezuelan facility on Dec. 26. This string of events at the end of the year underscores the president’s focus on foreign policy during his second term, The Hill’s Brett Samuels reports.

The president, now in his last term, is seeking to establish his legacy around the world as a dealmaker, and as a peacemaker.

▪ The Hill: Trump shows foreign policy focus to end 2025

NETANYAHU MEETING: Trump and Netanyahu on Monday were in lockstep during their after-meeting news conference, The Hill’s Filip Timotija and Colin Meyn report.

Trump said Israel had lived up to its ceasefire commitments “100 percent,” despite the U.S. reportedly scolding Netanyahu for killing a top Hamas military leader earlier this month.

A main focus was pressure on Hamas to disarm, with Trump saying the militant group would be “wiped out” if it refused to abide by its commitments in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan.

Trump also expressed support for U.S. strikes against Iran for Tehran’s purported extension of its ballistic missile program as well as for Israel’s potential military action against the country. Despite the language, he reiterated the U.S. is open to holding discussions with Tehran regarding its nuclear program.

The president also said he and Netanyahu have an “understanding regarding Syria,” adding that he was “sure” Israel and Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, would get along, Timotija and Meyn report.

Trump also discussed a potential pardon for Netanyahu’s fraud and bribery charges, saying that Israeli President Isaac Herzog was on board. Herzog denied that claim.

▪ The Hill: Trump backs Israeli strikes on Iran if ballistic missile tests continue.

With this year’s focus on foreign policy and solving international disputes, many of the president’s allies have said he is deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize, with Trump himself even quipping that he deserves it during an earlier meeting with Netanyahu.

But not everyone in the president’s party agrees with Trump’s foreign policy work, including Greene, who has said the president should be more focused on domestic issues. The Georgia Republican is an outlier, however, as she’s broken with the president publicly many times recently.

Polling has shown voters, too, have not necessarily rewarded Trump for his focus on foreign affairs.

A Quinnipiac University poll published earlier this month found Trump’s overall approval was at just 40 percent, while 54 percent of survey respondents disapprove. The poll found that 41 percent approved of his handling of foreign policy, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.

US ATTACKS FACILITY IN VENEZUELA: Few details are known about an attack that Trump has said “knocked out” a “big” facility in Venezuela as the administration continues to put pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Trump said this during a Friday appearance on the “Cats & Cosby” show on New York’s WABC radio and lauded the attacks on purported drug-smuggling boats in the region, The Hill’s Filip Timotija reports.

“We just knocked out — I don’t know if you read or you saw — they have a big plant or big facility where they send the, you know, where the ships come from,” the president told hosts John Catsimatidis and Rita Cosby. “Two nights ago, we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard.”

On Monday, Trump shed some more light on the attack, saying the U.S. personnel hit an “implementation” area.

“We hit all the boats and now we hit the area, it’s the implementation area. That’s where they implement. And that is no longer around,” the president said at Mar-a-Lago while taking questions alongside Netanyahu.

Trump said there was a “major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” adding it took place “along the shore.”

If confirmed, it would be the first land strike in Venezuela since the Trump administration began a pressure campaign against Maduro and since U.S. forces started striking alleged drug-trafficking boats in September.

ISSUES REMAIN IN UKRAINE PEACE TALKS: The president on Monday said thathe had spoken with Putin but that there were still “very thorny issues” to get through before solidifying a peace plan with Ukraine, Samuels reports.

Trump was expected to call the Russian leader following his Sunday meeting with Zelensky. And, though the exact details of which issues were the most difficult to negotiate with Putin are unclear, it is known that land ownership is a particular sticking point.

Additionally, Trump expressed frustration at Ukraine for claims from Russian officials saying that a Ukrainian drone attacked one of Putin’s residences, something Kyiv has denied, The Hill’s Ellen Mitchell reports.

“It’s one thing to be offensive. It’s another thing to attack his house. It’s not the right time to do any of that. … I was very angry about it,” Trump said, adding that he learned of the alleged attack during his call with Putin.

Also, following Sunday’s meeting to discuss the Ukrainian president’s 20-point peace plan, Zelensky said Monday that he asked Trump for the U.S. to commit to security guarantees for decades, and that Trump said he would consider it.

BIGGEST EDUCATION STORIES OF 2025: Education news in 2025 was dominated by Trump’s crusade against higher education and the U.S. Department of Education, The Hill’s Lexi Lonas Cochran reports. From the president consolidating his power over education institutions to immigration affecting K-12 students, here are just a few of the main education stories of the past year:

Trump dismantles Education Department

Since taking office Trump has singled out the Department of Education as something to get rid of. And Education Secretary Linda McMahon began the process in March when she laid off half the employees at the federal agency.

The president then signed an executive order ordering the department to be dismantled as much as legally possible.

“The department’s useful functions … will be preserved, fully preserved,” he said at the time, referring to Pell Grants, Title I funding and programs for students with disabilities. “They’re going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments.”

Programs hit hardest include the Institute of Education Sciences, Federal Student Aid and the Office of Civil Rights, which recently brought back some employees because of case backlogs, Lonas Cochran reports.

Immigration crackdown

Trump has always had a firm line on immigration policy, but many students were still surprised to see so many international students with ties to pro-Palestinian campus movements arrested.

The administration has said these students are a threat to the foreign policy of the United States and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio could order their deportation.

The administration has added new rules for foreign students, most notably adding a check on students’ social media accounts when they apply for a visa.

As a result, the crackdown has led to a drop in international students’ interest in attending school in the U.S., and K-12 districts with high immigrant populations have seen a decline in attendance.

Student loan changes

Trump is handling student loan repayment much differently from former President Biden, who advanced new measures to reduce student loan debt.

Notably, the Trump administration recently announced the end of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) income-driven repayment option, which is almost guaranteed to raise the rates for 7 million borrowers who will need a new plan.

Republicans’ massive spending package, which passed earlier this year, also included changes to the student loan system that will drop the number of repayment options to two by 2028. One option is a standard repayment plan expecting payment within 10 to 25 years, and the other is a plan that requires 30 years of loan payments before they are forgiven.

The administration has also said it wants to remove some employers from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, as well.

Poor reading scores

Reading scores have been down since the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 was no different. Twelfth-grade reading scores from 2024 were at the lowest level since before 1992.

And at the beginning of the year, the Nation’s Report Card showed reading scores for fourth and eighth graders continued to plummet.

“These results are both heartbreaking and tragic,” Alicia Levi, president and CEO of Reading is Fundamental, said at the time. “We need to take action. … We are calling on, leaders from all sectors, public and private, to join us in this fight.”

But, as Lonas Cochran reports, the reading crisis is affecting older adults as well. A 2020 Gallup study found the reading crisis was costing the U.S. $2.2 trillion annually, with the problem likely getting worse over five years.

IOWA STATE SENATE ELECTION: Voters in Iowa will vote Tuesday in a special state Senate election that could allow Republicans to regain a supermajority in the upper chamber. The GOP already has one in the state House, but if they can win the West Des Moines-area seat formerly held by a Democrat, they can regain their tight grip on state government, The Hill’s Julia Mueller reports.

Republicans held a supermajority in the state Senate until Democrats broke it during an August special election, which added to national Democrats’ optimism during the 2025 off-year elections. Democrats in Iowa and at the national level are looking to hold on to current trends and keep their momentum going ahead of the 2026 midterms.

The race is between Renee Hardman (D) and Lucas Loftin (R), who are running against each other for the District 16 seat following the death of state Sen. Claire Celsi (D). Republicans currently enjoy a 33-16 seat advantage over Democrats in the state Senate, just one voting member shy of being able to override the governor’s veto outright.

Democrats won an August election to break the state Senate supermajority and have made Tuesday’s election a priority. And the odds are in their favor.

Celsi won the district by 16 percentage points against a Republican after redistricting in 2022 and went on to win reelection by 40 percentage points over a Libertarian Party competitor. Though Trump won Iowa last fall, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won the District 16 area by 17 percentage points.

Hardman, the first Black woman elected to the West Des Moines City Council, is currently the West Des Moines mayor pro tempore. Loftin, a political newcomer, is a longtime employee of an environmental services company and is active on boards related to homeschooling.

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee has called the race a “must-win” to protect the party’s “hard-won progress” after Iowa marked the sixth time Democrats broke a state legislature GOP supermajority in the last two years.

Democrats have enjoyed a year of expected and unexpected wins and seek to continue the trend going into 2026.

The Closer

And finally … It’s time to add Gonzaga men’s basketball coach Mark Few to the list of people disappointed with the sport’s current situation.

Coaches across college sports have lodged complaints as student-athletes are now able to receive name, image and likeness (NIL) compensation and transfer multiple times without penalty, The Hill’s Max Rego reports.

Concerns came to a head last week when 21-year-old James Nnaji, a former NBA draft pick, committed to Baylor University and was given four years of eligibility by the NCAA.

“Our lack of leadership has really shown,” Few told reporters Sunday after his team beat Pepperdine University 96-56, according to The Spokesman-Review. “Now it’s probably time to get some help from Congress, but they’re more screwed up than the NCAA.”

Few added that leaders “need to start listening to coaches” on relevant topics.

Nnaji, who was the 31st pick in the 2023 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons, has not played on an NBA or G League team. Instead, he has spent the past two-plus years playing professionally in Spain and coming to the U.S. to compete in the NBA Summer League, retaining his collegiate eligibility.

But Nnaji’s decision, and Baylor’s decision to put him on the team, has been met with condemnation by some coaches.

Michigan State University head coach Tom Izzo joined Few and slammed collegiate athletics leaders for allowing this to happen.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Leading-Walz_120425_AP_Steve-Karnowski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 18:12:24.363533

There are sixteen smaller proposed warehouses, including one in Highland Park, according to the Post's reporting.","A Michigan lawmaker says she is looking into rumors circulating online about a detention center potentially coming to Highland Park.

State Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) says she is in contact with the mayor of the Detroit-adjacent community after reporting last week identified plans by the Trump administration to build large holding centers to speed up deportations.

Chang, who represents neighborhoods including those in Highland Park, said the community was on the list of potential cities where one of these warehouses would be built.

What they're saying:

""We know that a few days ago, there was an article in the Washington Post that listed out a number of cities across our whole country — places that are going to host huge detention centers, places that are going to hold smaller detention centers and Highland Park was on that list,"" said Chang.

The state senator told FOX 2's Roop Raj she had been in touch with the local state representative and mayor of the city in hopes of getting more answers about the plans.

""We were trying to figure out if this was accurate. I still don't have the answer to that question, but it has definitely raised the alarm,"" she said. ""None of us want an ICE detention center in Highland Park.""

She said residents have reached out to her office, saying they have no interest in a facility like the one allegedly proposed by ICE being brought to Highland Park.

The backstory:

Reporting in the Washington Post on Dec. 24 found efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul the country's immigrant detention center in favor of a plan that uses industrial warehouses that hold tens of thousands of immigrant detainees at a time.

The Post cited a ""draft solicitation"" that included plans for large warehouses in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia, and Missouri.

There are sixteen smaller proposed warehouses, including one in Highland Park, according to the Post's reporting. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security could not confirm the reporting.

FOX 2 has also reached out to the White House for comment, but has not heard back.

Dig deeper:

The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations is part of the president's agenda that he outlined throughout his campaign.

Since taking office, the U.S. has seen its Immigration and Customs and Enforcement agency ramp up efforts at detaining immigrants in a bid to remove them from the country.

The Post cited reporting out of Arizona in which the agency's acting director advocated for treating deportations more like a business.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.
“This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.” The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger.
According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.
Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.","Dec 30 (Reuters) – The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging a Virginia law that makes immigrants in the country illegally eligible for reduced in-state tuition and financial aid at the state’s public colleges and universities.

Monday’s lawsuit marked the latest in a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which restricts states’ ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

“This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country.”

The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar “tuition equity” laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in California said in his ruling that the federal government can legally share ""basic biographical, location, and contact information"" with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ruling will take effect on Jan. 6, according to court documents.

The development comes months after 20 states, including California, sued in July to prevent the federal government from sharing with ICE data obtained by the Department of Health and Human Services about immigrants receiving Medicaid benefits.

""We are disappointed in the court’s decision allowing for the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE,"" said a statement from the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta, one of the nearly two dozen Democratic officials who sued to block the information-sharing effort.

Chhabria noted in his ruling that while basic Medicaid information can be shared with ICE, the injunction still applies to other information, including data about immigrants legally in the country.

""Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decision making process,"" Chhabria wrote.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the ruling was ""a victory for the rule of law and American taxpayers.""

Undocumented immigrants are largely ineligible for federal health benefits, and they do not qualify for comprehensive Medicaid coverage.

But some undocumented immigrants can receive treatment for life-saving procedures in emergency rooms through Emergency Medicaid, and some states – including California – allow people to receive other state-funded benefits regardless of their immigration status.

The Trump administration has pushed for agencies across the federal government to share more information with immigration authorities to power the president's deportation agenda. Judges have blocked several of those efforts.

In September, a federal judge in California temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Agriculture from collecting data about recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. In November, a federal judge in Washington, DC blocked the IRS from sharing tax return information with ICE.

Virginia law extends eligibility to individuals who established residence in the state at least a year prior, and a student may not be disqualified based on their immigration status.

“This is not only wrong but illegal. The challenged act’s discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over citizens is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law,” the 13-page complaint states.

The DOJ filed its lawsuit in federal district court in Richmond, Va. A judge has not yet been assigned.

It adds to legal challenges the Trump administration has filed against other states over similar policies that provide migrants access to in-state tuition and education benefits.

The administration in June first sued Texas before bringing subsequent lawsuits against Kentucky, Oklahoma, Illinois and California. DOJ has reached agreements with the three red states, while Illinois and California continue to fight their lawsuits.

The Virginia suit comes as Democrats prepare to take over the state’s governor’s mansion and attorney general post next month after a series of victories in the recent elections.

The Hill has reached out to the office of Jason Miyares, Virginia’s current Republican attorney general, for comment.

The Justice Department’s lawsuit alleges Virginia’s law runs afoul of the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause by violating federal immigration law, which prohibits states from providing migrants in the country unlawfully with postsecondary education benefits denied to citizens.

""Well said… Merry Christmas,"" Bovino said, adding he would follow her X account.

When another critic brought up Swalwell’s alleged relationship with a Chinese spy named Fang Fang — which the congressman denies – Bovino quipped, ""Oh yes, how could I forget to mention that.""

Other commentators slammed Swalwell for appearing to misstate the underlying facts of why Joseph and Mary had gone to Bethlehem and why they fled to Egypt soon after Jesus Christ’s birth — a storyline immigration activists sometimes use to counter pro-border security arguments.

DHS FIRES BACK AFTER DEM LAWMAKER CLAIMS SHE WAS 'PUSHED ASIDE AND PEPPER SPRAYED' DURING ICE RAID

One cited a passage from the Gospel of Luke, which recounts that Caesar Augustus ordered a census across the Roman Empire, requiring each man to return to his ancestral town. Joseph, a descendant of King David, therefore traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem, David’s birthplace.

Per the Gospel of Matthew, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to take his family and flee to Egypt, as King Herod was seeking to kill young Jesus.

Observers often debate the connection, if any, that biblical passages have to contemporary immigration policy arguments.

Immigration hawks often cite Egypt as being a province of the Roman Empire, meaning the Holy Family did not immigrate to another country as refugees in a legal sense, but to escape Herod’s rule as a provincial king installed by Rome; similar to a governor; until his death made it safe to return to Judea.

Others dispute that characterization.

ICE DELIVERS 'GREATEST GIFT OF ALL' WITH CHRISTMAS ARRESTS OF CONVICTED CRIMINALS ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES

""Eric – Mary and Joseph were legal immigrants complying with the rules of the Roman Empire,"" conservative activist Robby Starbuck responded to the congressman.

""Rome ordered a census and Joseph had to be counted because Bethlehem was his city; basically the opposite of illegal immigration. Lying about this is Christophobic,"" he said.

Starbuck added that in the Book of Acts, God ""marked out … boundaries of their lands,"" which the commentator said was proof that secure borders have scriptural grounding.

U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley’s order does not reflect the underlying legal merits. It is intended to ensure the migrants can remain in the country until the judge considers the case more fully.

“Because of the serious consequences at stake, both for the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, the Court finds an administrative stay appropriate, as it would ‘minimize harm,’ while allowing the assigned District Court Judge the time this case deserves,” Kelley wrote in her four-page ruling.

The judge will issue a new decision after receiving written briefing through Jan. 13.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows migrants to stay in the U.S. and receive work authorization when they are from a country experiencing armed conflict, environmental disaster or other extraordinary conditions.

South Sudan was first designated for the program in 2011 as it gained its independence and became Africa’s youngest country. It has been plagued with war, and a State Department advisory urges Americans to avoid travel to the country.

Roughly 232 South Sudanese are currently TPS recipients, court filings indicate.

President Trump’s second administration has looked to shrink the program by revoking various countries’ TPS designations. Lawsuits remain ongoing over changes to the program regarding Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced she had conducted a review of conditions in South Sudan and the administration was terminating the country’s TPS status after Jan. 5.

It sparked a lawsuit from individual South Sudanese TPS holders and African Communities Together, an immigrant rights organization. They claim Noem acted unlawfully by acting with racial animus against nonwhite immigrants, failing to consult with appropriate agencies and not having good reason for the decision.

Kelley, an appointee of former President Biden who serves in Boston, will consider those arguments next month. But her ruling keeps TPS in place in the meantime, ensuring recipients do not become eligible for deportation as early as next Tuesday.

The plaintiffs pleaded with the judge for the immediate intervention, warning they will otherwise face “irreparable harm, including deadly harm.”

The Trump administration urged the judge to deny the request, criticizing the plaintiffs for waiting more than six weeks after Noem’s announcement to sue and insisting an administrative stay should only serve to briefly freeze legal proceedings.

“It should not serve to directly enjoin Executive agency action, which is what Plaintiffs’ requested administrative stay would accomplish,” the Justice Department wrote in court filings Monday.

The judge rejected those arguments. She wrote that the government’s proposed approach could imminently result in some individuals’ deportations.

“Further, if their TPS expires and is eventually restored following a full consideration of the merits, any gap in immigration status for South Sudanese nationals could result in ineligibility for future relief,” Kelley wrote.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25310446835020-e1767108543803.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 11:58:52.879418

By Darmin Bachu

TiE New York has formally responded in court to the lawsuit brought by charter member Kesav Dama, arguing that the case reflects an internal dispute rather than actionable misconduct and urging the court to allow the organization’s governance activities to proceed uninterrupted.

The response, filed as an opposition to an Order to Show Cause, marks the first detailed public articulation of TiE New York’s position since the litigation became public — after multiple board members, including former president Jignesh Patel and secretary Vaibhav Parikh, declined to comment for prior reporting.

At the center of the latest development is the court’s interim ruling lifting a previously issued temporary restraining order that had briefly restricted certain TiE New York governance actions.

Justice Karina E. Alomar of Queens County Supreme Court declined to extend the TRO after reviewing the parties’ submissions, allowing TiE New York to resume routine operations while the broader lawsuit continues. The ruling does not dismiss the case or resolve the merits of the allegations, but it signals that the court was not prepared—at this preliminary stage—to impose emergency restraints on the organization’s leadership.

Legal analysts note that lifting a TRO is procedurally significant but not dispositive. “It reflects the judge’s assessment that immediate irreparable harm was not sufficiently established for interim relief,” said one nonprofit litigation attorney familiar with similar cases. “It does not mean the underlying claims lack substance.”

TiE NY’s argument

In its opposition papers, TiE New York and the individual defendants characterize the lawsuit as an attempt to judicialize an internal governance disagreement. The filing argues that:

The board followed established procedures in addressing complaints;

An internal subcommittee was formed to review the allegations;

No emergency circumstances justified court-imposed restraints on elections, finances, or leadership decisions; and

The plaintiff failed to demonstrate irreparable harm warranting extraordinary relief.

DefendantsOppositionToShowCause

The defendants further contend that granting the requested relief would improperly interfere with the autonomy of a New York not-for-profit corporation and set a precedent for courts to manage internal disputes better handled through organizational processes.

As part of TiE New York’s response, former president Jignesh Patel submitted a sworn affidavit denying allegations of threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority. Patel asserts that communications cited in the complaint were taken out of context and that his actions were consistent with his duties as an officer of the organization.

The affidavit also challenges the plaintiff’s credibility and motivations, framing the dispute as a reaction to disagreements over governance and decision-making rather than misconduct.

TiE New York’s filings rely heavily on a report prepared by a board-appointed subcommittee, which concluded that the complaints did not warrant disciplinary action against Patel. The report describes interviews, document review, and deliberations undertaken by select board members tasked with evaluating the allegations.

Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the subcommittee, noting that its members were drawn from the same board accused in the lawsuit of failing to act. Those concerns are likely to feature prominently as the litigation proceeds.

Despite filing extensive court papers, TiE New York leadership has not offered on-the-record comment to the press. Patel, Parikh, and other board members again declined to respond to questions for this follow-up article, referring inquiries to court filings or offering no response at all.

The absence of public explanation has drawn criticism from some members, who argue that transparency is particularly important for a nonprofit organization that positions itself as a steward of ethical leadership and entrepreneurship.

What the ruling does — and does not — resolve

The lifting of the TRO allows TiE New York to continue operations, including governance and administrative functions, while the case advances through motion practice and potential discovery. It does not resolve:

Whether fiduciary duties were breached;

Whether the board acted in good faith in responding to complaints;

Whether internal processes were adequate or conflicted; or

Whether damages or injunctive relief may ultimately be warranted.

Those questions remain before the court.

With emergency relief denied but the lawsuit intact, the case now enters a more conventional litigation phase. Observers expect motions to dismiss, possible document discovery, and further judicial scrutiny of board conduct.

For TiE New York, the immediate operational threat may have eased, but the reputational and legal challenges persist. As one nonprofit governance expert noted, “A lifted TRO buys time—but it doesn’t end the conversation. In many ways, it just begins the real examination.”

Baltimore protest calls for ICE to leave Maryland in wake of Glen Burnie Christmas Eve shooting

""Put pressure on lawmakers to stop collaborating with ICE — abolish the agency altogether. Put the money toward something good.""According to witnesses, ICE agents followed the driver, identified by authorities as Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins, from a nearby Walmart.Agents caught up with him in a parking lot while he was playing a game on his phone, authorities said.ICE officials said Sousa-Martins is an undocumented immigrant from Portugal. Agents said Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquivel, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, was in the passenger seat.ICE officials said agents approached the vehicle and instructed the driver to turn off the engine. The driver refused and attempted to flee.

Protesters gathered Monday at the ICE Field Office in Baltimore in response to a Christmas Eve shooting involving ICE agents in Glen Burnie.

Authorities said ICE agents shot and wounded the driver of a vehicle they claimed rammed into their vehicle.

The protest, organized by the People's Power Assembly, called on getting ICE out of Maryland — and everywhere else, for that matter.

""We consider that our duty to be out here, speak up against what's happening,"" said one protester. ""Put pressure on lawmakers to stop collaborating with ICE — abolish the agency altogether. Put the money toward something good.""

According to witnesses, ICE agents followed the driver, identified by authorities as Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins, from a nearby Walmart.

Agents caught up with him in a parking lot while he was playing a game on his phone, authorities said.

ICE officials said Sousa-Martins is an undocumented immigrant from Portugal. Agents said Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquivel, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, was in the passenger seat.

ICE officials said agents approached the vehicle and instructed the driver to turn off the engine. The driver refused and attempted to flee. ICE said the driver weaponized his vehicle and began ramming his van into several ICE vehicles.

The People's Power Assembly (PPA) organized the protest in direct response to the ICE officer shooting that happened in Glen Burnie on Christmas Eve. In that incident, ICE maintains its officers only acted in self-defense.

While one of the protesters' goal was to raise awareness of ICE's activity locally, PPA organizers told WJZ they want to pressure state leaders to act.

Calling for an end to ICE enforcement

Protesters gathered on the corner of Hopkins Place and Baltimore Street, which is near where the ICE Baltimore Field Office, holding signs and calling for ICE to be abolished.

They chanted, ""ICE out of Baltimore! ICE out of Maryland!""

""All they had on the [people involved in Glen Burnie] was they were suspected of being [undocumented] immigrants. We reject that,"" said PPA organizer Andrew Mayton.

In a statement, ICE said officers shot Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins -- who the agency says is an undocumented Portuguese immigrant -- when Sousa-Martins tried to ram other vehicles and the officers.

ICE said the officers first tried to get him to turn off the engine, which he refused to do. Solomon Antonio Serrano-Esquival, who ICE has identified as a Salvadoran undocumented immigrant, was in the passenger seat with Sousa-Martins.

PPA organizers hopes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and other state lawmakers move to ban cooperation agreements some counties have with ICE, as well as 287(g) agreements.

287(g) agreements are where ICE gives local law enforcement the authority to perform some immigration officer enforcement duties.

A bill to ban 287(g) agreements failed to reach Gov. Moore's desk in the 2025 legislative session, but several lawmakers have expressed interest in introducing another similar bill in the upcoming session.

""ICE is its own department, there is no other kinds of collaborative efforts similar to this. All it does is put communities in danger,"" Mayton said.

WJZ reached out to ICE for any updates to the investigation into the Christmas Eve shooting, but didn't hear back. ICE issued a statement on the day of the shooting that called on ""extremist rhetoric"" against the agency to stop.

""The incident, which is still under investigation, comes as the extremist anti-ICE rhetoric and outright lies of politicians, the news media, activists, and violent agitators continue to fuel a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against ICE officers,"" the agency said.

Sousa-Martins and Serrano-Esquival were taken to area hospitals and, at last check, are stable.

Local ICE activity

The Christmas Eve shooting is one of the latest local showings of President Trump's ramped up immigration enforcement.

Another recent case making headlines is the detainment of 22-year-old Dulce Consuelo Morales Diaz. She was taken into ICE custody when she was on her way home from a Taco Bell in Baltimore, despite saying she's a U.S. citizen.

Her lawyer, Victoria Slatton, has gone viral for her TikToks about Morales Diaz. She posted a TikTok Sunday reporting Morales Diaz has been transported to a third detention facility. She'd previously been detained in Louisiana and Texas.

Slatton has said she has Morales Diaz's birth certificate, immunization records, and other documentation proving her client's U.S. citizenship. The government has maintained Morales Diaz is an undocumented immigrant, and that she claimed to be a Mexican citizen to border patrol when she was at the Arizona-Mexico border in 2023.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/29/99d2e872-3ba8-4afa-a7fc-2d5889e10d95/thumbnail/1200x630/3ed72be8a269e18668e2183df3ca9567/iceprotest.png,N,,2025-12-30 11:59:07.701148

The big picture: The judge's order permits sharing of basic biographical, contact and location information, a win for the Trump administration's effort to use Medicaid data in its immigration crackdown — an arrangement that critics said raised privacy concerns.

Context: Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federal Medicaid coverage.

But emergency Medicaid dollars pay hospitals for care provided to those who meet eligibility requirements regardless of immigration status, per KFF. And some states provide state-funded coverage to some who are ineligible for federal funds.

Driving the news: U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, a California-based Obama appointee, said in his Monday order that sharing basic biographical, location and contact information is ""clearly authorized by law.""

However, he strictly limited what kinds of data could be shared.

The Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can provide citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID for those illegally living in the United States.

Chhabria did block broader data sharing, writing that ""the new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be.""

State of play: Chhabria pointed to government filings outlining the policy and legal background on such information sharing, including one that said CMS would provide ICE the ""minimum required information.""

But that policy said CMS may share other information beyond immigration status, location and phone numbers ""on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law.""

Chhabria wrote that many questions remain and that the memos fail to address ""why a more narrowly tailored policy, focused on the basic biographical information discussed above, would not suffice for immigration enforcement purposes.""

Catch up quick: The judge blocked the Trump administration in August from using the information for immigration enforcement purposes, finding a ""reasoned decisionmaking process"" did not precede the policy change.

That prior preliminary injunction will remain in place until next Monday.

The criminal charges against McIver stem from a conflict at Delaney Hall, a recently reopened, 1,000-bed immigrant detention facility in Newark. The facility — located just miles from New York City — plays a key role in the Trump administration’s deportation efforts in the region.

Julian “Vicente” Ortiz Velazquez was taken into custody on Nov. 4 after leaving the Lowe’s parking lot in Puyallup with a truck full of lumber. His wife, Shauna, said unmarked vehicles surrounded him as he pulled onto South Fruitland.

“They started asking him about his legal status,” Shauna said. “And he said, ‘I have the right to remain silent, can you please tell me why you’re detaining, what did I do wrong?’”

Two days before Christmas, video captured the moment his family embraced him for the first time in more than two months. A federal judge had ruled he should be released from custody while his case continues.

“Every day you just sit in there and think about how your family is surviving on the outside,” Shauna said, translating what her husband said. “When you’re the main source of income…it feels like every day is an eternity.”

In a statement to KING 5, ICE said:

“ICE arrested Julian Ortiz Velazquez Nov. 4 because he is in the United States illegally in violation of federal law as written by Congress. He has been returned to Mexico on three separate occasions in 2021 and will be detained at an ICE detention facility pending immigration proceedings and will be afforded due process before a federal immigration judge.”

Shauna said Vicente does not have a criminal history and was working to obtain legal status — both through an asylum claim and through his marriage to her. The couple has been married for three years, and she is a U.S. citizen.

Despite his release, Vicente now wears an ankle monitor and is restricted from leaving the state.

“It’s not necessarily house arrest — he can go anywhere he wants, just can’t leave the state,” Shauna said.

His arrest comes amid reports that top Trump officials have encouraged ICE to increase arrest numbers by targeting places like Home Depot, Lowe’s and 7-Eleven — locations where day laborers often gather.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump adviser Stephen Miller directed agents to “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens” and specifically suggested big-box retail locations.

KING 5 also witnessed ICE agents arrest another father outside a Home Depot in Redmond in October.

Shauna describes her husband as hardworking and devoted.

“He would literally give someone his shirt off his back to make sure they weren’t cold,” she said back in November.

Their daughter said losing him so suddenly has been painful.

“I never thought the whole father-daughter relationship…was something I was going to get, and he made it possible for me,” Alexandrea Ortiz said.

Deploying National Guard

One of the most prominent cases involved the topic of deploying the National Guard to Portland.

In September, President Donald Trump described Portland as ""war ravaged"" in a social media post, following protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.

Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced he was sending troops to Portland, protesters and ICE agents came face to face with minor clashes. KATU witnessed one get detained by officers.

The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit, arguing that the president lacked the authority to invoke Title 10 and deploy the National Guard without proving a rebellion, invasion, or inability to enforce federal law.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and the president had a tense text message exchange over his invoking of Title 10 and authorizing the troops to go to Portland.

Judges ultimately sided with Oregon, ruling that the protests did not meet these criteria. The Trump administration appealed the decision, until a judge permanently blocked the deployment in early November.

Gender-affirming care penalties

Another high-profile case saw Oregon Attorney General Rayfield suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over Secretary RFK Jr.'s declaration that providers could be barred from Medicaid if they allowed gender-affirming care for children.

Rayfield contends that RFK Jr. lacks the authority to define professional standards of care. The case is ongoing.

Imposing tariffs

Other states also joined Oregon in challenging President Trump's tariffs, including a 145% tariff on most Chinese products.

Experts estimated these tariffs could increase the cost of living for Oregonians by about $4,000 annually.

Rayfield argued that only Congress has the authority to impose taxes and tariffs, as outlined in Article 1 of the Constitution. The federal court sided with Rayfield, but the Trump administration has since appealed.

Federal funds

Earlier this year, Oregon sued the Trump administration over the freezing of federal funds.

The administration had announced a freeze to audit overspending, affecting nonprofits working on social issues like domestic violence.

The court ruled in favor of Oregon, stating that the president could not impose new conditions on already awarded funding.

SNAP data

In the summer of this year, Rayfield and Wash. Attorney General Nick Brown were among AGs from 20 other states suing the Trump administration over its efforts to obtain data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.

According to the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was improperly attempting to gather sensitive personal information from low-income families who use food stamps. The requested information included Social Security numbers and home addresses.

In December, a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from fining states millions of dollars over their implementation of SNAP under new federal government guidelines.

Around that time, the Trump administration reversed its guidance, saying that noncitizens living in the country legally remained eligible for the food assistance program.

The guidance included refugees, asylum seekers and permanent residents, also known as 'green card"" holders.

That order, however, is temporary and prohibits the administration from penalizing the states as the states’ lawsuit is considered by the courts.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.
“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego.
“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said.
HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.","SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — HBO has begun airing a documentary about the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández-Rojas, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who died while at the hands of Border Patrol agents at the San Ysidro Port of Entry.

The film is called “Critical Incident: Death at the Border,” which details accounts of the Border Patrol’s involvement in Hernández’s death and the ensuing investigation, which has been described as a “cover up” by Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a human rights advocacy group.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.

“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego. He had a wife, five U.S. citizen children born here and was a member of the community,” Guerrero said.

Hernández encountered the Border Patrol agents after trying to enter the country illegally; he had been deported days prior to the incident.

“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said. “Unfortunately, that was only the first part of the story — the second part was the cover-up.”

According to Guerrero, the Critical Incident Team that was sent to investigate Hernández’s death tried to exonerate U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the agents involved of any civil and criminal liability.

“After he died, after he stopped breathing, they went up onto the pedestrian bridge and took the video cameras off and they erased those videos,” Guerrero said. “They also cleared the crime scene of any evidence … then they went to the hospital and removed all the Taser wires. … They were shadow units, they were cover-up units clear and simple.”

Guerrero stated they came across the investigation results while researching legal measures against the agents and discovered these criminal incident teams had been involved in other border-related incidents over many years.

In 2022, CBP disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the matter while recognizing that Hernández’s human rights had been violated.

“The HBO documentary is so timely because it exposes what unchecked power looks like at the largest law enforcement agency in the country and it reminds us what the consequences are,” said Guerrero.

HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.

“That’s not just a documentary, but it’s also investigative journalism,” Guerrero said.

Neither CBP nor Border Patrol provided comment about the HBO film, which began airing on Monday.

In May 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the units “were widespread — used in seven of nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors, including San Diego, on the southwest border — and operated for years with little to no oversight.” The GAO’s report suggested that CBP take additional steps to strengthen its response to incidents involving its personnel.

In response to the 2024 GAO report, CBP issued a statement saying in part: “CBP continually evaluates and improves upon its policies, practices, and procedures to ensure they are consistent with the law, and adhere to the highest standards. CBP has made tremendous strides improving oversight and training, and in reducing incidents involving the use of force.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/12/cit-hbo.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-30 11:59:03.790817

Chhabria's order notes that basic information is something that the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that governs ICE, has always had the authority to request.
“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” he wrote.
But in June, CMS began sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and in July, CMS and ICE ""entered into a formal data-sharing agreement,"" Chhabria wrote in background about the case.
The previous ruling that barred sharing information will be in effect until next Monday, which was its previous expiration date, ""solely for administrative purposes,"" Monday's ruling says.","A federal judge in California ruled Monday that the federal government is allowed to share basic information about Medicaid participants with Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid a government push to locate people it believes are in the country unlawfully.

The plan to share information from the federally backed program had been blocked by a preliminary injunction that applied to 20 states that sued, including California.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria partly denied the states' request for a preliminary injunction Monday, writing that “basic biographical, location, and contact information” is legal under the law.

But he also granted the injunction as it pertains to any information beyond that.

“We are disappointed in the court’s decision allowing for the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE,” the office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement Monday.

“Though we are gratified that the court enjoined DHS’s broader efforts to obtain more sensitive health data; data of citizens, lawful permanent residents, and other people with lawful status; and data from other CMS administered health programs,” Bonta’s office said, referring to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Monday's order notes that the Medicaid services agency, CMS, has said in a notice that it ""will share the minimum required information,” such as “citizenship and immigration status, location, and phone numbers.”

Immigrants unlawfully in the United States are largely not eligible for Medicaid.

All states are required to offer emergency Medicaid — temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms — to anyone, regardless of immigration status.

Emergency Medicaid spending accounts for less than 1% of the program’s expenses, according to a study published in October in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Chhabria's order notes that basic information is something that the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that governs ICE, has always had the authority to request.

Chhabria also said in his partial order that there are many unanswered questions.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” he wrote.

His order grants a preliminary injunction against sharing information of broader categories.

Chhabria cited questions about whether DHS may request information about lawful citizens or lawful permanent residents, including in mixed households in which some are lawfully in the country and others are not.

“The new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be,” he wrote.

Medicaid is a federal and state joint program that has about 79 million enrollees across the country. In California, it is called Medi-Cal.

The California attorney general’s office said Monday that participants expected privacy.

“When individuals signed up for Medi-Cal, they did so with the understanding that their data would not be used for purposes unrelated to administering the program,” it said.

CMS has long had a policy of not sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and since at least 2013, ICE has had a policy of not using that data for immigration enforcement, Chhabria wrote in a ruling in August.

But in June, CMS began sharing data about Medicaid patients with ICE, and in July, CMS and ICE ""entered into a formal data-sharing agreement,"" Chhabria wrote in background about the case.

The lawsuit was against the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security and others.

Those agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday evening.

Federal agents fanned out in Minneapolis on Monday for a “massive investigation on child care and other rampant fraud,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

Noem posted the update about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions on X and said “more coming.”

The post shows agents wearing jackets with large white letters, “HSI,” for Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE — interviewing people at storefronts.

Homeland Security posted a separate notice saying that agents were “going DOOR TO DOOR at suspected fraud sites.”

“The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found. Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS is working to deliver results,” a Monday X post said.

About $9 billion has been lost to fraudulent claims in Minnesota’s federal-assistance programs, federal authorities have estimated. Dozens of people have been arrested, charged and convicted since 2022 in at least three major scandals, with more arrests expected as additional scandals are probed, federal prosecutors have said.

In other recent action, the Small Business Administration announced it was cutting off $5.5 million in federal funds because Minnesota state officials haven’t effectively safeguarded federal tax dollars, said Kelly Loeffler, the head of the agency.

Although the scandals are now drawing national attention, concerns over programs being defrauded on a large scale date back to at least 2018. Some whistleblowers raised alarms as early as 2009.

Minnesotans said that contributing factors include the state’s generous, progressive social-welfare policies, lax enforcement, and the “Minnesota Nice” attitude: A willingness to help others with few questions asked.

In addition, whistleblowers said they were reluctant to come forward because they suffered retaliation and claims of “racism” or “Islamophobia” for reporting allegations against Somali immigrants, who are Black and Muslim.

Patel: FBI Surged Resources to Minnesota Early in Investigation

FBI Director Kash Patel on Sunday confirmed that his office had surged resources to Minnesota to investigate claims of fraud exploiting federal services and programs.

Federal officials have so far indicted 78 people and convicted 57 individuals in a $250 million fraud scheme in Minnesota, Patel said in a post on X. Charges included wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and more.

“The FBI is aware of recent social media reports in Minnesota,” Patel wrote. “However, even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs. Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide.”

The FBI director also said that the recent arrests are “just the tip of a very large iceberg.”

“We will continue to follow the money and protect children, and this investigation very much remains ongoing. Furthermore, many are also being referred to [immigration] officials for possible further denaturalization and deportation proceedings where eligible.”

The fraud scheme, Patel wrote, resulted in the stealing of “federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during COVID” including “sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network.”

“These criminals didn’t just [engage] in historic fraud, but tried to subvert justice as well,” he said.

Patel noted a case in which a defendant and others have been “charged for attempting to bribe a juror with $120,000 in cash.”

“Those responsible pleaded guilty and were sentenced, including a 10-year prison term and nearly $48 million in restitution in related cases,” he said.

The FBI chief’s announcement was made after a viral video posted online showed a day care in Minneapolis that allegedly obtained millions of state-backed funding, even though it was largely inactive. Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., called for Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office to investigate.

Vice President JD Vance called the fraud allegations in the state “a microcosm of the immigration fraud in our system.”

“Politicians like it because they get power. Welfare cheats like it because they get rich,” Vance wrote on X on Saturday. “But it’s a zero sum game, and they’re stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.”

Joe Thompson, first assistant U.S. attorney, told reporters earlier this month that the scale of fraud in Minnesota-run programs is astronomically high. Fraud was found in programs involving services such as child nutrition, housing services, and autism, he said.

“I’m sure everyone is wondering how much of this $18 billion was fraud,” Thompson told reporters. “That’s the $18 billion question.”

In response to the investigations, Walz in October ordered a third-party audit and paused payments to the 14 programs for 90 days. One program has since been shut down entirely. Walz says the state aggressively increased resources for fraud detection and prevention and recently appointed a statewide director of program integrity to oversee those efforts.

Aside from Patel’s statement, the White House has sounded the alarm for fraud among Minnesota’s Somali community. On Thanksgiving, President Donald Trump described the state as “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” and noted that he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota.

Walz has been critical of Trump and the White House’s statements about Somalis in his state, saying in an NBC interview in late November that administration officials are “demonizing an entire community.”

The county’s seen numerous deportation operations kick off throughout the region since June, raising a host of concerns from some residents, local officials, state legislators and congressional representatives.

A series of protests kicked off shortly after the raids began in June, with protestors railing against ICE sweeps in downtown Santa Ana, near the federal buildings.

Not long after that, the National Guard came to town and were posted by federal buildings in Santa Ana, including the Ronald Reagan federal courthouse.

[Read: Orange County Grapples With Federal Occupation]

The raids have also spurred the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana to roll out immigrant aid funds for people impacted by ICE raids – helping with things like legal representation and rent payments.

Some local elected officials throughout OC warned that creating such immigrant aid programs could jeopardize critical federal funding for things like housing assistance.

Other city council members called on their local police departments to work with ICE, with the Huntington Beach City Council voting to disregard state law and direct officers to assist in deportation efforts.

While the roving deportation tactics were temporarily put on hold by a federal judge, a majority of U.S. Supreme Court Justices ultimately blocked that restraining order as the lawsuit plays out in lower court.

Who Got Caught Up in ICE Sweeps?

Beginning in early June, federal agents began detaining people throughout the county – from courthouses to Home Depots.

[Read: Orange County Braces For ICE]

“We all I guess were under the impression that the presence of ICE was going to be to target dangerous, violent criminals. But what we’re seeing, and what I woke up to yesterday, were day laborers looking for work that were being detained, tackled with excessive force by Homeland Security officers and ICE,” Orange County Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento said at a June 10 county supervisors’ meeting.

The deportation efforts also reached neighborhoods, like in Santa Ana and Irvine.

Shortly after the raids kicked off, Congressman Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) criticized federal agents for not going after criminals.

“From what I saw, I don’t believe those are serious violent criminals,” Correa said at a June news conference . “I saw a couple individuals that looked like they got pulled off a job painting somewhere.”

“Why did you pick up working individuals? They’re not violent serious criminals to my knowledge,” he said.

In the coming months, immigrant advocates and volunteers have told Voice of OC that federal officials restructured immigration policies, turning once documented immigrants into undocumented immigrants.

“It’s not criminals, it’s the most vulnerable of the immigrant population that are being made undocumented. Immigration has their information because they’re applying, they’re trying to do it the right way and they’re being targeted,” said volunteer and a federally accredited immigration legal representative, Bethany Anderson, in a late October interview.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly told Voice of OC throughout the year that agents have done their due diligence and have conducted “highly targeted” deportation enforcement.

According to data from the Department of Homeland Security, a large majority of the over 5,700 people in ICE detention facilities throughout California are considered “no ICE threat.”

As of Nov. 28 – the latest available data – 67% of the people in ICE facilities are “no ICE threat” while 33% are considered ICE threats.

One Orange County case made national news after federal agents violently arrested Narciso Barranco, a 48-year-old Tustin landscaper who’s a father of three U.S. Marines.

It kicked off a series of protests, vigils and calls for immigrant aid programs.

[Read: Tustin Landscaper Violently Arrested in Deportation Sweeps Says Hope Lives]

Barranco, who was arrested in Santa Ana in June, has since been released and is working his way through the immigration system.

His son, Marine veteran Alejandro Barranco, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration in July.

“My father is a human being but was not treated with the dignity he deserves. He has always made sure to do his best in giving back and supporting this country like we all do. That is who he is – that is who this country punched, threw in detention and is trying to deport,” Alejandro Barranco told the committee.

“I am here today because I want other people who have had family members like my dad taken away to know they’re not alone. Thousands of families like ours are being ripped apart and their stories matter. I want this committee to understand the human impact of the immigration policies

A Wave of Protests

A wave of protests began June 9 – the same day deportation sweeps kicked off – in Downtown Santa Ana, the heart of Orange County.

In the coming days, thousands of demonstrators railed against ICE raids and called on elected officials to take stands against the operations.

But concerns immediately began surfacing on how local police departments responded to the protests, namely in Santa Ana.

It spurred Santa Ana City Councilman Johnathan Hernandez to ask for a public accounting of how police officers responded, including information like what types of non-lethal rounds were used and how many times such tactics were deployed.

The protestors also focused on Mayor Valerie Amezcua, who was largely silent on the ICE raids in June.

[Read: Santa Ana’s Response to ICE Protests Prompt Questions for Police & Mayor]

At a June city council meeting, numerous residents sounded off at the public podium – criticizing the city’s response to the raids.

[Read: Santa Ana Residents Demand Mayor Resign, Citing Weak Response to ICE Raids, Protests]

During a November police oversight commission meeting, Santa Ana Police Department officials said the response was textbook and that officers targeted bad actors among the protestors.

Yet many who were at those protests, like Hernandez, dispute that characterization of events.

There were also large-scale demonstrations in Anaheim and Santa Ana – as part of the nationwide “No Kings” protests – where a diverse group of residents voiced numerous concerns against federal policies, especially the ICE raids.

In June, thousands of people gathered at Anaheim’s La Palma Park for the “No Kings” protest.

And in October, thousands gathered in Santa Ana’s Centennial Park to rail against deportation sweeps and other federal policies, like cuts to food stamps.

ICE Sweeps Spur Immigrant Aid

The raids spurred a roundtable of state legislators and community organization leaders over the summer, when Assemblymembers Sharon Quirk-Silva (D-Fullerton) and Avelino Valencia (D-Anaheim) detailed how much the raids were impacting Orange County’s local economy.

[Read: Orange County Feels Economic Fallout of ICE Raids]

The community organizations also told the state legislators they needed resources from the state so they could continue helping people impacted by the deportation sweeps.

Recently, Valencia announced state legislators carved out a $1.5 million state grant to Catholic Charities OC in an effort to get more legal resources for the immigrant community and help people become legal residents and citizens.

[Read: More OC Immigrants Could Get Citizenship, Visas Under $1.5 Million State Grant]

In the meantime, the cities of Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Santa Ana created immigrant aid funds for their residents – helping people with things like groceries, rent and legal assistance at a time when many are too frightened to go to work or the grocery store.

[Read: Immigration Legal Aid Funds Grow in Orange County]

OC Supervisor Sarmiento and various community organizations also helped establish a $1.5 million fund aimed at helping people through the immigration legal system.

Like Correa, Sarmiento said that President Donald Trump’s administration hasn’t been targeting criminals like what federal officials promised early in the year.

“You have now Homeland Security, Border Patrol and ICE officers staged at some of the immigration courts throughout Southern California and here in Santa Ana, which I’ve personally seen, that are ready to detain immediately after a summary dismissal,” Sarmiento said in a September phone interview.

A Flashpoint in Garden Grove

Orange County saw one of the most thorough debates on the deportation sweeps at a Garden Grove City Council meeting in October as officials there considered a resource webpage for residents – a portion of the city website that directs people to things like legal aid and other resources.

During the Oct. 28 council meeting, Councilwoman Arianna Arestegui successfully got a majority of her colleagues to support creating the resource page.

“We need to have this conversation together,” Arestegui said during the meeting. “A lot of these provisions are things that are being enacted by other cities in our region that are major stakeholders in this issue as well and Garden Grove is the third largest Hispanic community in Orange County.”

But Councilman George Brietigam said the issue should be tackled at the state level and blamed California’s sanctuary law for the deportation raids – a law that largely curbs local law enforcement from aiding deportation efforts.

“The state is responsible. Not the federal government, the state – they created sanctuary state laws,” Brietigam said. “The sanctuary state laws made it so ICE has to go out in the community and chase people down. And it looks terrible, it scares people. It scares kids. This is what the state created.”

[Read: Garden Grove Becomes Flashpoint of Immigration Debate in Orange County]

Brietigam, who said immigrants should go through the citizenship process instead, voted against the resource page.

Mayor Stephanie Klopfenstein, who abstained on the vote, warned the resource page could land Garden Grove on the federal government’s radar – potentially jeopardizing federal funding.

“I don’t want to have to look somebody in the face and say your rental assistance has been taken from you.”

The government had argued that the plaintiffs should pursue other legal avenues, including habeas corpus petitions, to challenge their treatment.
“The ‘inherently transitory’ exception thus no longer applies to Mr. Hernandez Torres, rendering his claims moot,” the judge wrote.
Representatives for the plaintiffs, ICE and the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","(CN) — Carmen Sequen faced a dilemma familiar to thousands of immigrants across the country: appear for her hearing and risk arrest by ICE agents or stay away and lose her chance to make a legal case to remain in the United States.

On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge P. Casey Pitts of the Northern District of California ruled that such concerns warrant judicial examination. He rejected the government’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit challenging policy change implemented by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Justice Department’s immigration court system.

The decision allows Sequen and two other plaintiffs to continue their challenge against policies they say have fundamentally altered immigration enforcement. This includes Yulisa Alvarado Ambrocio and Ligia Garcia.

“In general, there is a strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action,” Pitts, a Joe Biden nominee wrote in his order.

In May, ICE issued final guidance allowing its agents to make civil immigration arrests in or near courthouses on a case-by-case basis whenever they believe a noncitizen will be present, easing earlier restrictions that generally limited such arrests to national security threats, imminent danger or other exceptional circumstances.

The plaintiffs say the policy shift has led to more absences at immigration hearings as they weigh the risk of arrest against appearing for their cases. Pitts found that the plaintiffs had reasonably argued that the government didn’t provide sufficient justification for the changes.

“Plaintiffs plausibly allege that each of the challenged policies is arbitrary and capricious,” she wrote.

The plaintiffs also challenge ICE’s elimination of a longstanding 12-hour limit on detention in short-term holding facilities. The agency now permits detention in these facilities for up to 72 hours or longer under what it terms exceptional circumstances.

In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs describe conditions at ICE’s San Francisco field office that include overcrowded rooms with open toilets, limited access to hygiene products and showers, and inadequate sleeping arrangements.

Pitts expressed concern about the policy’s internal contradictions.

“Providing for overnight or multi-night detention in hold rooms while preserving a prohibition on ‘sleeping apparatus’ is not just likely but certain to lead to violations of noncitizens’ due process rights to be free from punitive conditions of confinement,” he wrote.

The government had argued that the plaintiffs should pursue other legal avenues, including habeas corpus petitions, to challenge their treatment. Pitts rejected that argument, explaining that such petitions have limited scope.

“Habeas petitioners may challenge only the fact or duration of particular detainees’ confinement,” she wrote. “Plaintiffs could not use habeas to challenge ICE’s failure to provide a reasoned basis for its overall policy of permitting detention longer than 12 hours in short-term hold rooms.”

Pitts granted the government’s motion to dismiss claims brought by Martin Hernandez Torres, who was removed to Mexico and no longer faces the prospect of detention by ICE.

“The ‘inherently transitory’ exception thus no longer applies to Mr. Hernandez Torres, rendering his claims moot,” the judge wrote.

The decision allows claims by Sequen, Ambrocio and Garcia to move forward. The court has already issued preliminary orders staying the courthouse arrest policies within ICE’s San Francisco area of responsibility, which covers Northern California, Hawaii, Guam and Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands, and requiring ICE to address conditions at its holding facility on Sansome Street.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided unauthorized immigrants in-state tuition.
Texas became the first state to offer in-state tuition to unauthorized students in 2001, according to the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.
In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that the provision illegally favors unauthorized immigrants living in Virginia over U.S. citizens who reside outside the state and would not be eligible for the reduced in-state tuition.
In 2020, Ralph Northam, a Democrat and then the Virginia governor, signed legislation allowing unauthorized immigrants in Virginia to receive in-state tuition.","The Justice Department sued Virginia on Monday over its policy of granting unauthorized immigrants in-state financial aid at public colleges and universities, saying that the assistance violates federal law because it discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states.

The complaint came as Virginia’s term-limited Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, prepares to leave office next month. He will be succeeded by the state’s Democratic governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger. It is the latest in a series of lawsuits from the Trump administration aimed at blocking states from extending tuition benefits to unauthorized immigrants.

In November, the administration sued California over a similar tuition policy, and in September it brought a case against Illinois over its financial aid program for unauthorized immigrants.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided unauthorized immigrants in-state tuition.

Texas became the first state to offer in-state tuition to unauthorized students in 2001, according to the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group.

The case in Virginia centers on a section of the state’s legal code that allows students who have lived in Virginia for at least two years to qualify for in-state tuition at public universities.

In its complaint, the Justice Department argued that the provision illegally favors unauthorized immigrants living in Virginia over U.S. citizens who reside outside the state and would not be eligible for the reduced in-state tuition.

“This is not only wrong but illegal,” the lawsuit said. “The challenged act’s discriminatory treatment in favor of illegal aliens over U.S. citizens is squarely prohibited and pre-empted by federal law.”

Governor Youngkin’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the state’s attorney general, Jason Miyares, another Republican who is due to leave office next month. The Virginia Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As of September, at least 14 states offered financial aid to students without regard to immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center, another advocacy group. But many states’ policies are shifting.

In 2020, Ralph Northam, a Democrat and then the Virginia governor, signed legislation allowing unauthorized immigrants in Virginia to receive in-state tuition. At the time, Mr. Northam said the law underscored that the students were “Virginians, in every sense of the word, except for the immigration status,” according to WTOP-FM.

State Senator Jennifer B. Boysko, a Democrat who cosponsored the legislation, said in an interview Monday night that she was unsurprised by the lawsuit, saying that she expected the Trump administration to move to penalize the state as Democratic leadership takes over.

Seeing it first hand, Muhammad Haseeb Ahmad is anxiously awaiting word on whether he can obtain permanent residency.

“It's like just waiting and waiting — frustration at its pinnacle,"" he said.

The 25-year-old from Pakistan completed his master's in applied computing in artificial intelligence (AI) from the University of Windsor in October 2024. He applied to an immigration stream that catered to master's and PhD graduates, and has been waiting ever since.

Ontario changing its system as Ottawa cuts caps

The prog ram he a pplied to falls under Ontario's Immigrant Nominee Program (OINP). A partnership with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the program provides a fast-track to permanent residency for workers and international students with skills in specific areas seen as a benefit to the overall Canadian economy.

The Ontario government is looking at changes to the program. Already, a skilled trades stream has been cancelled, and the government is considering going from nine entry categories (based on skills and profession) to a proposed four.

An Ontario government webpage seeking feedback on the proposed changes says the plan would simplify the process for applicants and their employers, f acilitate access for ""priority health-care applicants"" and add a path for entrepreneurs.

There will also be fewer spaces. Ottawa has reduced the number of provincial nominee applications accepted by about half, as the federal finance minister says Canada wants to bring immigration to ""more sustainable"" levels.

Ahmad said he and his friends worry that their stream will get suspended as proposed, though they may still be eligible under a different proposed stream for “exceptional talent.”

Amid that uncertainty, he said, his plan to pursue a PhD in medical AI from University of Toronto or University of Waterloo — paperwork for which is already prepared — is now on hold.

Ahmad said he still hopes things will work out.

“After every darkness, there's a hope. After every night, there's a light. I'm hopeful I will get nominated and get my permanent residence.”

International student permit cuts are pushing away prospective students, experts say

Ahmad has time on his work permit until fall 2027 and if nothing works out, he said he would pursue his PhD in New Zealand instead.

“We are not sure what those new requirements going to be. So far, it's totally unclear,” he said.

Skilled trades stream axed

For a London, Ont., man, six years of efforts to attain permanent residency in Canada have gone down the drain and he said he's returning home follow ing the suspension of the skilled-trades stream under OINP.

“I am done with Canada. I've done everything I could do fo r this economy. And then, if this is how I'm going to be treated, then I'm sorry, no thank you. I'm a human too,” Ankit Kumar Patel said.

CBC spoke with the 29-year-old soon after the announcement of the suspension and, a month later, he says going back home is his only option. Patel came to Canada in 2019 as an international student from India after completing his mechanical engineering degree.

After studying at Fanshawe College, he secured a three-year work permit and worked as a computer numerical control operator for manufacturing companies.

In October 2024, with three months left on his work permit, Patel applied to the OINP for permanent resident status under the skilled-trades category.

Move to suspend parts of Ontario immigration program leaves London man in limbo

Immigrant workers say future in limbo as government ranking system scores soar

More than a year later, on Nov. 14, the provincial government, in an update posted an on the ONIP web page, announced the indefinite suspension of the program's skilled trades stream due to fraudulent applications in the system.

“I feel betrayed. If I knew that it's going to end up this way, then I would’ve pursued something else and not waste my time working three years in a trade.”

Patel said it’s unfair the province is treating all applicants with the same broad stroke.

“It's like a broken promise… If they didn't need us in the first place, they should not have invited us,” he said.

Patel and hundreds impacted by th e suspension of the trades stream staged protests last month outside the OINP's office. CBC spoke with some of them, who say the province’s decision has thwarted their years of hard work and hopes of becoming Canadians.

In an emailed statement, the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development said the move is in line to better meet current and future labour market needs in Ontario.

“This decision was made following a comprehensive review that found evidence of systemic misrepresentation or fraud in applications to the skilled trades stream,” the statement said.

“Examples of these systemic compliance and enforcement concerns include falsified information relating to work experience claims, including manufactured payroll records, inaccurate or falsified income documentation, and forged employer reference letters.”

The ministry said prior to the suspension, it had approved 59 applicants from the stream for a nomination but all other applications in the stream remain closed.

NDP calls for reopening of applications

Alexa Gilmour, Ontario NDP critic for the OINP file, said the wider OINP overhaul and restructure from nine to four immigration streams could be “a jobs disaster.""

She said there were 2,600 applicants under the now-suspended trades stream. She called on the government to reopen the applications and give them ""due process.""

“[The workers] did everything right … then the rug was pulled out from under them on November 14th. These workers were not only betrayed, but painted unfairly,” she said.

The employers and the communities that depend on those workers need them, she said. In northern Ontario, Gilmour said, whole communities are counting on these trades workers.

Expect more immigration scrutiny, lawyer says

Lou Janssen Dangzalan, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, said misrepresentation and fraud has plagued OINP with “unsavory agents or ghost consultants and sometimes even licensed representatives” padding applications with problematic documentation.

But Dangzalan said it is still a “disruptive and drastic” move to the applicants and the businesses to cancel the trades stream entirely.

“This is purely a political policy choice,” he said.

“I do applaud the Ontario government for acknowledging that there's a problem, but I'm not sure if basically using a hammer to kill a fly would be a good idea in a house of glass.”

Dangzalan said realistically, applicants should start planning for a possible future where they may need to leave Canada.

“But that doesn't mean that their PR journey is necessarily over right there. Leaving Canada doesn't mean that you're already automatically excluded from the Canadian experience class.”

He said if people have to leave and wait in their home countries for PR, they can work toward gaining skilled work experience there, which can bump their scores, and boost language scores, including by learning French.

“So, 2026 is going to be tough for a lot of people… 2026 is going to be a year of enforcement… IRCC’s going to scrutinize every single application with more diligence than they ever did before.”

“From a large policy perspective, this is a crisis… There's still an immigration arms race. A lot of candidates are available who are very fantastic candidates and Canada is going to need this, especially at a time where Canada is trying to wean itself away from its dependence from the United States.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/8a1f7bf8-4157-4447-82b8-4630596d64ac,1766434178580/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C222%2C4032%2C2268%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-30 02:57:31.120880

Twenty-one states asked the court to block enforcement of an October ICE policy memo that rescinded a 2019 rule barring the use of health care information for immigration enforcement.

“The Trump administration’s effort to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement is a violation of their trust and will lead to fewer people seeking vital health care, harming the overall health of our communities and increasing public health costs to the state.”","SAN FRANCISCO (CN) — A federal judge on Monday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy permitting the agency to obtain basic information of certain Medicaid patients for immigration enforcement purposes.

U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria ruled that the sharing of Medicaid data that is “the primary focus of the new policies” — including basic biographical, location and contact information — is “clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

However, the Barack Obama appointee blocked the agencies from sharing any information beyond the specified categories.

“The new policies are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be,” he said in the seven-page order released Monday.

Twenty-one states asked the court to block enforcement of an October ICE policy memo that rescinded a 2019 rule barring the use of health care information for immigration enforcement.

The new policy allows ICE to request and use data from the Department of Health and Human Services for “any and all law enforcement activities that ICE is authorized to pursue as a matter of federal law.”

Chhabria rejected many of the states’ arguments against the data-sharing policies, ruling that the Department of Homeland Security has broad statutory authority to obtain data from other agencies to “pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives, like immigration enforcement,” and that Congress requires agencies to comply with legitimate data requests from DHS.

The judge also rejected the states’ claims that the data-sharing policies violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, the Affordable Care Act and the Social Security Act, finding the policies “do not restrict ICE from obtaining Medicaid data pertaining to the basic biographical, contact and location data of unlawfully present aliens.”

However, Chhabria sided with the states regarding data beyond basic information, echoing concerns raised at the Dec. 9 preliminary injunction hearing about what additional information DHS could request on a “case-by-case basis,” whether data about citizens or lawful permanent residents could be sought, and whether the policies would allow HHS to share sensitive medical information about Medicaid patients with DHS.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decision-making process,” Chhabria said, adding that the “government failed to provide satisfactory answers to these and other questions based on the contemporaneous record” at the Dec. 9 hearing.

The new preliminary injunction temporarily bars HHS and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from sharing information received from the plaintiff states with DHS or ICE, unless it is limited to the citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID of individuals who are not in the country legally.

Chhabria added that if such basic information is “not severable” from data the agencies are prohibited from obtaining, including information about U.S. citizens or sensitive medical records, it may not be disclosed.

Representatives for either party did not respond to a request for comment.

The states sued the Trump administration in July, claiming that the health information of millions of individuals — including their immigration status — was shared with DHS, which oversees ICE, without their consent and in violation of federal law.

On Aug. 12, Chhabria granted the plaintiff states’ initial request for a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking DHS from using Medicaid data obtained from the plaintiff states for immigration enforcement purposes, including data they already acquired.

The previous preliminary injunction will remain in effect until Jan. 5, 2026.

The California Attorney General’s Office told Courthouse News it is disappointed in the judge’s decision to allow the sharing of some Medicaid data with ICE.

“When individuals signed up for Medi-Cal, they did so with the understanding that their data would not be used for purposes unrelated to administering the program,” a spokesperson said. “The Trump administration’s effort to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement is a violation of their trust and will lead to fewer people seeking vital health care, harming the overall health of our communities and increasing public health costs to the state.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/06/doctors-in-operating-room.jpg/w=800,h=600,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-29 22:56:58.766032

During a live interview with KFOX14/CBS4, Escobar highlighted issues with subcontractors failing to deliver services at Camp East Montana, a tent detention facility for migrants, which reportedly cost taxpayers $1.24 billion.

RELATED: Human rights groups reiterate allegations of abuse at Fort Bliss detention site

""Subcontractors who are supposed to deliver laundry services... are not doing it,"" Escobar said, noting that detainees are reporting that they themselves are washing their clothes in their sinks while the subcontractor continues to receive payment for these services.

Escobar also pointed out that janitorial services, meant to be daily, are reportedly only performed once every 10 days.

Escobar emphasized the need for oversight, despite Democrats being in the minority.

""I have visited Camp East Montana four times now. And, and just for context, I think it's really important for El Pasoans to know that this is part of the job that members of Congress are supposed to do,"" Escobar said, adding that it is important to make sure that taxes are being spent appropriately.

However, Escobar noted that she believes it has been difficult to get her colleagues from across the aisle to get on board with scrutinizing the camp, as she said, ""Unfortunately, not everyone believes that we should provide humanitarian care to human beings in our custody.""

Escobar said she has tried to appeal to Republican colleagues on fiscal grounds, arguing that while people lose healthcare and joblessness rises, the government pays billions for inadequate services at Camp East Montana.

""Republicans do not seem at all bothered by the fact that American taxpayers keep dishing out billions of dollars for services that are not being delivered,"" Escobar said.

From introducing the ""Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act,"" which calls for the establishment of oversight over these types of centers, to sending letters and testimonies from detainees to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has categorically denied allegations that conditions in Camp East Montana are inhumane.

A DHS official dismissed the claims as ""fearmongering clickbait,"" asserting that detainees receive proper meals, medical treatment, and opportunities to communicate with lawyers and family members.

Below is DHS's full statement:

This is fearmongering clickbait. As our brave ICE law enforcement is facing a more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them, KFOX14 is choosing to smear them with anonymous allegations. Here are the facts: any claim that there are 'inhumane' conditions at ICE detention centers are categorically false. No detainees are being beaten or abused. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, access to showers, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States. Get a grip.

These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people. If you break our laws and come to our country illegally, you could end up in any number of third countries. President Trump and Secretary Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens out of American communities and out of our country.

Aboud suggested that those speaking out have their own motivations, saying, ""They’re always going to complain because they hate Republicans. Lawyers are paid to find reasons to complain.""

The film is called “Critical Incident: Death at the Border,” which details accounts of the Border Patrol’s involvement in Hernández’s death and the ensuing investigation, which has been described as a “cover up” by Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, a human rights advocacy group.

Alliance San Diego has been seeking justice for Hernández and his family ever since he was killed.

“Anastasio was a long-time resident of San Diego. He had a wife, five U.S. citizen children born here and was a member of the community,” Guerrero said.

Hernández encountered the Border Patrol agents after trying to enter the country illegally; he had been deported days prior to the incident.

“Anastasio was tragically tortured, beaten, kicked, stomped, and killed by border agents,” Guerrero said. “Unfortunately, that was only the first part of the story — the second part was the cover-up.”

According to Guerrero, the Critical Incident Team that was sent to investigate Hernández’s death tried to exonerate U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the agents involved of any civil and criminal liability.

“After he died, after he stopped breathing, they went up onto the pedestrian bridge and took the video cameras off and they erased those videos,” Guerrero said. “They also cleared the crime scene of any evidence … then they went to the hospital and removed all the Taser wires. … They were shadow units, they were cover-up units clear and simple.”

Guerrero stated they came across the investigation results while researching legal measures against the agents and discovered these criminal incident teams had been involved in other border-related incidents over many years.

In 2022, CBP disbanded the Critical Incident Teams, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held a hearing on the Hernandez-Rojas case, ultimately calling for the reopening of the matter while recognizing that Hernández’s human rights had been violated.

“The HBO documentary is so timely because it exposes what unchecked power looks like at the largest law enforcement agency in the country and it reminds us what the consequences are,” said Guerrero.

HBO reached out to Alliance San Diego a few years ago about conducting its own investigation, according to Guerrero.

“That’s not just a documentary, but it’s also investigative journalism,” Guerrero said.

Neither CBP nor Border Patrol provided comment about the HBO film, which began airing on Monday.

In May 2024, the U.S. Office of Government Accountability Office issued a report stating that the units “were widespread — used in seven of nine U.S. Border Patrol sectors, including San Diego, on the southwest border — and operated for years with little to no oversight.” The GAO’s report suggested that CBP take additional steps to strengthen its response to incidents involving its personnel.

In response to the 2024 GAO report, CBP issued a statement saying in part: “CBP continually evaluates and improves upon its policies, practices, and procedures to ensure they are consistent with the law, and adhere to the highest standards.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.”

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation’s third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

“The ruling confirms what we’ve long believed, that members of Congress are entitled to visit federal facilities without notice.
Congress must be able to exercise its oversight authority at ICE facilities, just like any other federal agency.","SAN DIEGO (KGTV) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's policy requiring congressional members to give seven days advance notice before visiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, ruling the restrictions interfere with Congress's oversight responsibilities.

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a Colorado congressmember. It comes after San Diego's Democratic congressional delegation was twice denied access to an ICE holding facility inside the federal building downtown over the past two months.

In late November, the delegation finally gained access to the facility after being turned away on previous attempts. The congress members were told they needed to provide seven days advance notice under a Department of Homeland Security policy announced in June.

""We will never know whether they cleaned it up for us because we had to give them all sorts of notice,"" Rep. Scott Peters said during their eventual visit.

Rep. Juan Vargas expressed frustration with the changing requirements during their second denied attempt.

""They told us the 48-hour rule. We followed that. The seven-day rule, we followed that. And yet, once again, they say no,"" Vargas said.

The federal judge in Washington D.C. ruled the advance notice requirements were ""contrary to law"" and described the restrictions as causing ""tangible harm"" that interferes with Congress's oversight role. The ruling temporarily blocks the policy while the case proceeds.

San Diego's four Democratic congress members were unavailable for interviews Monday, but Peters issued a statement reacting to the ruling.

“The ruling confirms what we’ve long believed, that members of Congress are entitled to visit federal facilities without notice. It’s part of our oversight responsibilities. Nevertheless, we tried our best this fall to cooperate with the administration but even after we gave them plenty of notice we were twice denied entry. Fortunately, that won’t happen again,"" said Peters.

Congressman Levin also issued a statement Monday saying: “Earlier this year, following reports that ICE was violating its own detainment standards, my colleagues and I attempted to conduct oversight at the ICE facility inside the Edward J. Schwartz United States Courthouse in San Diego, only to be blocked by ICE.

Congress must be able to exercise its oversight authority at ICE facilities, just like any other federal agency. The American people deserve to know how detainees are being treated and how their tax dollars are being spent.

Blocking these visits has nothing to do with security and everything to do with hiding the truth and avoiding accountability.

This court ruling is a step in the right direction. Oversight isn’t optional, and NO agency gets to operate in the shadows.”

ICE did not respond to requests for comment but has previously defended the policy as necessary to maintain operational security and safety at facilities. In a past statement, ICE called the oversight visits a ""publicity stunt.""

The Trump administration is expected to appeal the judge's ruling.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/611fb27/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fausw2%2Fslices%2Fafe%2F790551469ef2448fbb6dfa541303db12%2Fafe03e2b95764e13a0b1fa1d673d650a%2Fposter_bbfa504046a54627bf925c8fa60598ab.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 21:11:56.900274

Because Democrats are in the minority, they cannot call an official congressional hearing. But throughout Mr. Trump’s second term, Democratic lawmakers have held informal events meant to draw public attention to their criticisms of the administration.

In a letter sent Monday to the Democratic caucus, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, said the hearing, set for Tuesday of next week, would highlight Mr. Trump’s broad clemency to rioters seeking to reverse his loss in the 2020 election, some of whom have been rearrested on other charges. He also said that lawmakers would explore “ongoing threats to free and fair elections posed by an out-of-control Trump administration.”

But with Democrats preparing for midterm elections in which they seek to win control of the House, Mr. Jeffries made clear that the hearing was meant to counter Republicans’ efforts to sanitize the storming of the Capitol.

“In the years since that disgraceful day, far-right Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attempted to rewrite history and whitewash the events of Jan. 6,” Mr. Jeffries wrote.

The mob of Trump loyalists that attacked the Capitol that day caused millions of dollars in damage, injured more than 140 police officers and, for the first time in U.S. history, interrupted the certification of a presidential election.

Next Tuesday’s hearing will be led by Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, who led the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the attack, held widely viewed hearings in 2022 and issued a report on Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn his election loss.

But the coming hearing, held by a party with little power to conduct oversight or compel action, will likely demonstrate just how much the dynamics around Jan. 6 have shifted in the year since Mr. Trump returned to power.

Though he once disavowed the rioters, Mr. Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign increasingly called them patriots and suggested they had been unfairly treated by the Justice Department.

The president opened his second term by granting clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack, including those who had assaulted police officers as they tried to disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power.

Earlier this year, Speaker Mike Johnson announced a new Republican-led subcommittee that would again investigate the attack and counter “false narratives” about it, part of a larger Republican project to recast the riot.

That panel, led by Representative Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, has yet to hold a hearing. But Mr. Loudermilk has said one of its targets would be the once-stalled investigation into the planting of pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters in Washington the night before the attack.

Earlier this month, officials arrested a Virginia man in connection with the pipe bombs, which had been at the center of right-wing conspiracies.

According to court documents released on Sunday, the man, Brian J. Cole Jr., told federal agents that he felt the need to “speak up” after he began to believe that the 2020 election had been tampered with.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/29/multimedia/29trump-news-j6-hearing-mptk/29trump-news-j6-hearing-mptk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 21:11:59.776917

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director Brian Nesvik, who was confirmed in August, has advocated delisting the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear and said both the bear and gray wolf populations have recovered.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., was the sponsor of the latest congressional effort to reduce protections. On the last day before leaving for the holiday break, the House passed her bill that would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue a rule that rescinded Endangered Species Act protections for the gray wolf.

The Trump administration finalized the gray wolf’s delisting in November 2020, but the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated it in February 2022 after finding that the Fish and Wildlife Service didn’t demonstrate that the population could be sustained outside of certain areas of the western Great Lakes and northern Rocky Mountains.

The ruling effectively reinstated protections for the wolf population in the lower 48 states. The decision made an exception for the northern Rocky Mountains, where the wolf was delisted by a 2011 act of Congress. Montana, Idaho and Wyoming state officials manage the population in those states.

By requiring the Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue the rule from the first Trump administration, Boebert said her bill would allow all states to set their own management policies.

Supporters of the delisting say the wolf population has sufficiently recovered and that management should be returned to the states. They say wolves, grizzly bears and other predators make it difficult to prevent human-wildlife conflict.

“We can no longer put farmers, ranchers, and even our pets in harm’s way by using taxpayer dollars to protect a species that has been fully recovered,” Boebert said on the House floor. “It’s time for the federal government to get out of the way and allow the state and tribal wildlife agencies to manage the species.”

Congressional Republicans have taken action before to remove endangered species protections for some species.

The House passed a bill in the last Congress identical to Boebert’s, and Rep. Harriet M. Hageman, R-Wyo., sponsored a bill that would delist the Greater Yellowstone population of grizzly bears that the House Natural Resources Committee approved in a 20-19 party-line vote in July.

Other bills and riders in appropriation measures have sought to either delist or prevent the listing of both predators and other species, such as the lesser prairie-chicken, whose listing impacts industry activity.

Supporter of delisting

But the second Trump administration has given congressional Republicans an agency ally in the push to delist predators.

Nesvik was previously director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, where he advocated delisting the Greater Yellowstone grizzly bear and said both the bear and gray wolf populations have recovered.

Nesvik also told the House Natural Resources Committee in 2023 that human-wildlife interactions were on the rise because the increasing number of bears has caused them to move into “non-suitable habitats,” including farms and backyards.

He intervened in October in a program to import wolves from British Columbia to reintroduce the species to Colorado, an initiative that was approved in a 2020 statewide referendum. Nesvik told Colorado Parks and Wildlife the importation violated an agreement between the state agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Mike Leahy, senior policy director for wildlife, hunting and fishing at the National Wildlife Federation, said he has been pleased that the Trump administration “hasn’t come down too hard on predators yet.”

But the Trump administration will have to decide whether to once again attempt to delist grizzly bears and gray wolves.

“How they handle the pending decision regarding grizzly bears will be interesting and telling,” said Leahy. “I think if they were to propose delisting grizzly bears nationwide, that would be a big mistake and probably lose pretty easily in court.”

Leahy said that instead of legislation to force the delisting of predators, Congress could instead focus on increasing appropriations for programs intended to compensate ranchers, such as the Wolf Livestock Loss Demonstration Project Grant Program.

The Senate’s fiscal 2026 Interior-Environment Appropriations bill would keep the same funding level of $1 million for the program, while the House (HR 4754) would increase it to $2.5 million.

In addition to delisting specific species, Republicans are eyeing further changes to the underlying law. A bill from House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., includes changes to the law that would limit courts’ abilities to review delisting decisions.

Westerman’s committee approved the bill, 25-16, on Dec. 17.

He said he hoped to bring the bill to the floor in 2026 or reach a bipartisan agreement with the Senate on changes to the law.

Neither the NOPD nor Murrill’s office have provided details on how the immigration policy might be altered.
The NOPD’s longstanding immigration policy was recently taken down from the department’s online policy manual.","New Orleans community groups and civil rights organizations are urging the city’s leadership to include them in drafting changes to the New Orleans Police Department’s immigration policy, which has been in place for nearly a decade but is currently under review following pressure from top officials in state government.

In letters addressed to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick and New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, organizations, including Familias Unidas en Acción, ACLU of Louisiana and the Vera Institute of Justice, expressed concern at recent reports that top NOPD officials have been working with Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill on a revised version of the department’s immigration policy. That policy, adopted in 2016, generally prohibits officers from inquiring about immigration status or directly participating in federal immigration enforcement efforts.

The department adopted the policy — and a number of others — under court order, as part of a long-running federal consent decree and has long been criticized by Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, both of whom are Trump allies and immigration hardliners.

Murrill has argued that local policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration agencies, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, run afoul of recently enacted state laws meant to bolster federal-local partnerships.

A federal judge lifted the consent decree last month. On Dec. 5, WWL-TV reported that Kirkpatrick had submitted a revised version of the immigration policy to Murrill for review. Then, on Dec. 18, Murrill announced on social media that she had met with Kirkpatrick and other NOPD officials “about keeping New Orleans residents and everyone who visits safe.”

“We certainly understand that recent changes in state law have created pressure on the New Orleans Police Department to change its policies,” reads the Dec. 17 letter to Kirkpatrick signed by more than 30 groups. “However, we are concerned that those changes appear to be taking place without community consultation.”

A second letter addressed to Moreno, sent Monday, echoed those concerns.

“We are concerned that Superintendent Kirkpatrick has chosen to engage in this process behind closed doors with an Attorney General whose values do not align with those of our city nor consider the families [that] will be separated by the policy,” reads a letter to Moreno, dated Monday, Dec. 29.

In the letters, the civil rights groups requested meetings with Kirkpatrick and Moreno to address how NOPD officers will engage with immigrants and with federal immigration enforcement agencies moving forward.

Neither the NOPD nor Murrill’s office have provided details on how the immigration policy might be altered. The NOPD did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. Murrill’s office pointed to previous statements she has made, which do not detail specific changes being contemplated.

The letters come amid a stepped up immigration enforcement effort —called operation Catahoula Crunch — that has sent hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents to southeast Louisiana. Just after that effort launched, Murrill told Kirkpatrick that the NOPD could be in violation of a 2024 state law prohibiting so-called “sanctuary policies” that limit local cooperation with ICE and Border Patrol.

The NOPD’s longstanding immigration policy was recently taken down from the department’s online policy manual. Asked for comment on Monday, an NOPD spokesperson said that Kirkpatrick was on leave, adding that the department might not be able to provide details on the policy discussions until she was back on duty.

When asked for a comment from Murrill, spokesperson Lester Duhé, directed Verite News to the letter that she had addressed to Kirkpatrick regarding cooperation with federal immigration agencies and to the post on X. Moreno’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite the groups’ allegations that community groups have been left out of the revision process, last week, community organizers and immigrant rights attorneys met with Kirkpatrick to provide input on a new immigration policy, according to people who attended. However, according to one attendee, Kirkpatrick was less than forthcoming about the new language under consideration.

In a phone interview with Verite News, Leticia Casildo, executive director of Familias Unidas en Accion, a local nonprofit that supports immigrant communities in the greater New Orleans area, said Kirkpatrick “took a really defensive posture,” during the meeting, telling the group they were addressing their concerns to the wrong person and that she did not believe community members should be involved in drafting the new policy.

“When we asked her to present the policies that were being re-written, she flat out denied us,” Casildo said. “That for us is so worrisome because we know that [Gov. Jeff Landry] has this agenda to hurt the immigrant community.”

Earlier this year, Murrill sued the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office over its immigration policy — also the result of a federal consent judgement — that blocks the agency from honoring voluntary requests from federal immigration agents to hold immigrants already booked into the parish jail past their release dates. These requests are called immigration detainers. That case is ongoing.

Casildo was part of a large effort to pass the OPSO policy, — which stemmed from a 2011 federal court case that alleged that two foreign-born construction workers were held for months beyond their release dates at the request of ICE. The policy was put into effect in 2013 as a settlement in the case.

“Those were not policies that some lawyer made in an office,” Casildo said. “They were fought hard for with blood and sweat and tears.”

Jeremy Jong, an attorney at national immigrant support nonprofit Al Otro Lado, who was at the meeting with Kirkpatrick last week, said he worries about the NOPD jumping too hastily into partnerships with federal immigration agencies without strict legal guidance to guard against abuses.

“You don’t know how to keep whatever cooperation that you’re going to do with ICE in legal bounds,” Jong said, pointing to a recent $112 million verdict against the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office in New York over allegedly improper ICE holds.

“If in the end there has to be a change – obviously we want a policy that cooperates with ICE to the least extent possible,” Jong said. “The details of that, I think personally, should be between the people most impacted and the police department.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the date of a letter to NOPD Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick and the date of a social media post by Attorney General Liz Murrill.

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federal Medicaid programs, but California and other blue states — Illinois, Colorado, New York, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, as well as Washington, D.C. — allow some people to receive state-funded benefits through their Medicaid implementation programs regardless of immigration status.

Chhabria’s order is narrowly tailored to six categories of “basic” personal information: citizenship, immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth and Medicaid ID.

The Trump administration is only allowed to share Medicaid data about people unlawfully living in the United States, meaning ICE can’t access personal information collected from other immigrants receiving Medicaid.

ICE and HHS remain barred from sharing personal health records and other potentially sensitive medical information for immigration enforcement under a preliminary injunction. Chhabria said the agencies did not provide a compelling reason for exchanging such information, which California and other states argued would violate health privacy laws.

“Beyond the basic information discussed above, the policies are totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process,” Chhabria wrote.

California sued the Trump administration following reports that HHS was sharing personal data collected from undocumented immigrant Medicaid enrollees with immigration officials at the Department of Homeland Security.

Chhabria in August temporarily barred the Trump administration from sharing such information for immigration enforcement purposes, but left the door open for data transfers to resume. His decision to revise the injunction comes after ICE and HHS published formal notices in November detailing how they planned to use Medicaid data in immigration cases.

The Trump administration has been less successful in seizing personal information from other government databases. Judges in recent decisions have blocked the White House’s attempts to share taxpayer data and food aid recipients’ information with immigration officials.

In May of this year, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a tribunal within the Organization of American States, found that what those officials did to Hernández Rojas amounted to torture, and that the U.S. government worked to cover up what happened. His widow Maria Puga said she will keep pushing until the people involved are in jail.

“This fight that had so much help from organizations, the community, people who saw me in the street and said, ‘That’s good, ma’am. You will succeed,’ it keeps going,” Puga said in Spanish.

The person who was in charge of the San Diego Sector of Border Patrol at the time of Hernández Rojas’ death is now running Custom and Border Protection for the Trump administration.

Even before President Donald Trump took office, in January, we saw El Centro Border Patrol agents make mass arrests in Bakersfield, far from their normal area of operation in El Centro, Calexico and Imperial. Since then, Border Patrol agents, under the leadership of Commander Gregory Bovino — a promotion from his previous position running the El Centro Sector — have gone from city to city, conducting raids and often violent arrests.

Violent arrests have also happened in the border region itself.

For example, in late January, immigration officials showed up at the door of a Croatian woman in San Diego. Their interaction left her visibly bruised. Months later, officials detained her until an attorney was able to get her out using a writ of habeas corpus petition, a federal court filing that argues the government has someone in custody unlawfully.

Though the Supreme Court has long given border officials the ability to conduct warrant-less searches at the border in certain contexts, it expanded their power this year in a decision after attorneys and advocates challenged Border Patrol agents’ use of racial profiling as they roamed Los Angeles and other parts of California. When that decision came down, Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S./Mexico Border Program, predicted in an opinion piece for CalMatters that the state violence that had long been in the border region would only keep growing on the interior of the country.

We’ve seen U.S. citizens who document immigration raids as they are happening arrested by federal officials, as in the case in Linda Vista in July when several were charged with assaulting a federal agent and held overnight at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. Charges against the immigrant who was initially arrested and against one of the U.S. citizens have been dropped. The other two cases are still pending.

In San Diego in particular, immigration officials have methodically expanded their reach in official spaces — from court hallways to green card appointments.

Since a reporting trip to Nicaragua in 2019, I’ve thought a lot about my peers there who have had to navigate covering an increasingly hostile authoritarian regime. Most, if not all, Nicaraguan journalists have had to flee, but they continue to cover what’s happening in their country as they live in exile.

This year, human rights groups and journalists have turned to their Latin American peers to have conversations about how to navigate their work as state violence increases. The Washington Office on Latin America hosted a panel in April about enforced disappearances after the Trump administration sent more than 200 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, where they were imprisoned.

“If there’s one thing we have learned in Latin America, the consequences, the impact of enforced disappearances are profoundly human,” said Carolina Jiménez Sandoval, president of WOLA, during the panel. “Sadly when a person or a group of people disappear, their relatives, their families, the community, the society to which the disappeared person belongs to suffers greatly. In Latin America, we know this feeling of agony. Unfortunately we know it too well.”

In November, the Knight Center for Journalism at University of Texas at Austin hosted a conversation with journalists living in exile.

“When all freedoms have been eliminated, when there is no freedom of reunion, freedom of mobilization, electoral freedom, religious freedom, the last reserve of freedom is journalism in exile,” said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, founder of Nicaraguan outlet Confidencial, during the panel.

As we look ahead to 2026, I know I will be keeping these conversations in mind as I continue to document how state violence plays out in the border region and beyond.",https://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trisha_20-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 17:57:09.307715

Deploying National Guard

One of the most prominent cases involved the topic of deploying the National Guard to Portland.

In September, President Donald Trump described Portland as ""war ravaged"" in a social media post, following protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.

Less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump announced he was sending troops to Portland, protesters and ICE agents came face to face with minor clashes. KATU witnessed one get detained by officers.

The state of Oregon filed a lawsuit, arguing that the president lacked the authority to invoke Title 10 and deploy the National Guard without proving a rebellion, invasion, or inability to enforce federal law.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and the president had a tense text message exchange over his invoking of Title 10 and authorizing the troops to go to Portland.

Judges ultimately sided with Oregon, ruling that the protests did not meet these criteria. The Trump administration appealed the decision, until a judge permanently blocked the deployment in early November.

Gender-affirming care penalties

Another high-profile case saw Oregon Attorney General Rayfield suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over Secretary RFK Jr.'s declaration that providers could be barred from Medicaid if they allowed gender-affirming care for children.

Rayfield contends that RFK Jr. lacks the authority to define professional standards of care. The case is ongoing.

Imposing tariffs

Other states also joined Oregon in challenging President Trump's tariffs, including a 145% tariff on most Chinese products.

Experts estimated these tariffs could increase the cost of living for Oregonians by about $4,000 annually.

Rayfield argued that only Congress has the authority to impose taxes and tariffs, as outlined in Article 1 of the Constitution. The federal court sided with Rayfield, but the Trump administration has since appealed.

Federal funds

Earlier this year, Oregon sued the Trump administration over the freezing of federal funds.

The administration had announced a freeze to audit overspending, affecting nonprofits working on social issues like domestic violence.

The court ruled in favor of Oregon, stating that the president could not impose new conditions on already awarded funding.

SNAP data

In the summer of this year, Rayfield and Wash. Attorney General Nick Brown were among AGs from 20 other states suing the Trump administration over its efforts to obtain data from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.

According to the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was improperly attempting to gather sensitive personal information from low-income families who use food stamps. The requested information included Social Security numbers and home addresses.

In December, a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from fining states millions of dollars over their implementation of SNAP under new federal government guidelines.

Around that time, the Trump administration reversed its guidance, saying that noncitizens living in the country legally remained eligible for the food assistance program.

The guidance included refugees, asylum seekers and permanent residents, also known as 'green card"" holders.

That order, however, is temporary and prohibits the administration from penalizing the states as the states’ lawsuit is considered by the courts.

TALLAHASSEE — Alligator Alcatraz. Guns. Social media.

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: The immigrant-detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed. Two other pending lawsuits target Escambia County School Board decisions to remove or restrict access to books.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or re-enter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social-media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.

WETLANDS: In a case closely watched by conservation and business groups, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is considering whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2020 improperly shifted permitting authority to Florida for projects that affect wetlands. A U.S. district judge sided with conservation groups that challenged the shift. Florida and business groups have defended giving authority to the state.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, VenezuelaImmigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole programSeparately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influentialThis is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0332836/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2018x1059+0+99/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2F21%2F70c112ca4639a4bbaa2b6c1897c6%2Fvenezuelans-tps-051925.png,N,,2025-12-29 18:57:20.989144

Therefore, AB 288 was rendered temporarily moot, at least until the Board is again unable to act.
The next NLRB Board Member to have his/her term expired is David Prouty in August of 2026.
Therefore, unless President Trump fires another NLRB Board Member in the next eight months, the NLRB will have a 3 person quorum through late August.
Two of the five NLRB Board positions remain open.","AB 288, enacted by the California Legislature in September (which CDF reported on in September and October of this year), mirrors a similar New York law and authorizes California’s Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to enforce provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the private sector when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) declines or is unable to act.

More specifically, AB 288 encourages and empowers private-sector unions and employees to take their disputes to PERB if the NLRB fails to act within statutory timeframes. Under AB 288, when the NLRB does not have a quorum or is otherwise not functioning, workers could petition PERB to:

Decide unfair labor practice cases that the NLRB has not resolved within six months;

Certify a union as the exclusive bargaining representative;

Order employers to bargain, reinstate terminated workers, or participate in binding mediation; and

Impose civil penalties, with funds earmarked for PERB’s enforcement efforts.

In short, the bill attempts to create a parallel state enforcement process for rights already guaranteed under the federal NLRA.

Shortly after enactment of AB 288, the NLRB filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court for the Eastern District of California seeking to enjoin enforcement of the statute on the grounds that it is preempted by the NLRA pursuant to the Garmon preemption doctrine. On Friday, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District, Judge Troy L. Nunley , ruled on the preliminary injunction and issued his decision granting the injunction and finding that AB 288 is preempted under Garmon.

Judge Nunley held that the court is “unable to consign the notion that Congress’ interest in the NLRB’s independence when it enacted the NLRA was so strong that that in its absence, Congress intended the NLRB to be stripped of its authority.” Judge Nunley went on to find that Congress’ foremost interest in enacting the NLRA and establishing the NLRB was “uniformity and avoidance of inconsistency.” Based on these findings, the Court issued its Order enjoining enforcement of AB 288 finding it to be preempted by the NLRA.

What Does This Mean For California Employers?

AB 288 only takes effect when the NLRB is unable to act (e.g., when the Board lacks a three member quorum or if there is a federal government shutdown). Although the NLRB was without a quorum and unable to process cases for almost eleven months, that all changed in mid-December. As we recently reported, with the appointment and the confirmation of Scott Mayer and James Murphy, the NLRB now has a quorum. Therefore, AB 288 was rendered temporarily moot, at least until the Board is again unable to act.

The next NLRB Board Member to have his/her term expired is David Prouty in August of 2026. Therefore, unless President Trump fires another NLRB Board Member in the next eight months, the NLRB will have a 3 person quorum through late August. Two of the five NLRB Board positions remain open. If a new Board member is not nominated and confirmed before August 27, 2026, the NLRB will again be without a quorum. Judge Nunley’s decision (unless overturned on appeal) confirms that should that occur, or should there be another extended federal government shutdown, unions and employees will be unable to obtain relief from the California PERB for private sector employer disputes and matters.",https://www.cdflaborlaw.com/_images/content/CDF-OG-logo.png,N,,2025-12-29 15:57:14.028757

“They do not want to have people have the ability to apply for asylum in the United States.” But the administration official countered that anyone who genuinely fears persecution should only be concerned about their safety.
In a federal lawsuit filed that year — revived this September — asylum seekers and immigration groups argued the agreements were unlawful.
“No one who has passed through other countries where they’re not being persecuted should get asylum [in the United States].
Since Trump returned to office, the White House has aggressively targeted the asylum system and tried to accelerate deportations.","“Asylum was not designed to provide people a backdoor way to get to a country of their choosing,” said a senior administration official, granted anonymity to discuss internal thinking about the strategy. “If the United States is confident that they can be successfully removed to another country where they will not be threatened, then there’s no reason or expectation that they should be allowed to remain here.”

The Trump administration’s strategy was bolstered in October when the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, an administrative body that oversees immigration courts, said judges should weigh third-country removal before an asylum case is considered in the U.S. The endorsement turbocharged the effort, and in November, DHS attorneys asked judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases, more than twice the amount in October and four times the amount in September, according to a recent analysis of immigration court data. It is not clear that all 5,000 were because DHS wanted to send someone to a third country.

In exchange for accepting migrants, these other countries have usually received less U.S. condemnation for alleged human rights abuses and greater security assistance.

Immigration attorneys and advocates, alarmed by the latest trend, argue that it’s a further erosion of the U.S. asylum system in the United States.

“The administration wants to demolish our humanitarian protection system,” said Rebekah Wolf, a staff attorney with the immigration justice campaign and policy department of the American Immigration Council. “They do not want to have people have the ability to apply for asylum in the United States.”

But the administration official countered that anyone who genuinely fears persecution should only be concerned about their safety.

“They shouldn’t care about what specific location,” the official said. “Many [immigration groups] somehow think that it’s bad to be doing this — that everyone should get a hearing, no matter anything else. But the reality from our perspective is, it is the law. And you may disagree with the law, but the way to address that is through Congress.”

DHS’s strategy provides another example of how President Donald Trump’s team learned from and built upon efforts of his first term. In 2019, DHS and the Justice Department issued an interim final rule allowing the U.S. to enter into third-country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — barring migrants from applying for asylum in the U.S. if the administration determined they could do so safely in one of the other nations. In a federal lawsuit filed that year — revived this September — asylum seekers and immigration groups argued the agreements were unlawful. Administration officials expect other lawsuits to be filed against their latest strategy.

This term, the White House has not only expanded efforts to strike these agreements with less stable nations, but has also cut other deals with countries willing to accept migrant deportees. For months, the administration has deported migrants to African nations, including South Sudan and Eswatini. The administration also sent more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they were detained in the country’s mega-prison for months.

And this month, Palau, an archipelago of roughly 350 small islands in the Pacific Ocean, inked a deal with the Trump administration to take up to 75 migrants in exchange for aid, another example of how the White House is looking to third-countries to accelerate deportations of people who cannot be returned to their home countries.

As for asylum protections, supporters of the administration argue that the system has long been abused, and they are simply course correcting to bring the program in line with its original intent.

“No one who has passed through other countries where they’re not being persecuted should get asylum [in the United States]. If you’ve passed through other countries, you’ve effectively ignored other opportunities to claim asylum,” said Mark Krikorian, head of the Center for Immigration Studies think tank, which favors restrictions on immigration. “It’s a way to deter bogus asylum claims.”

A DHS spokesperson said the agency is working to remove all unauthorized immigrants from the United States, while “ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.”

“Asylum Cooperative Agreements,” as DHS calls them, “are lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims” the spokesperson said. “DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system.”

DHS said last month that the Trump administration is on pace to shatter deportation records, projecting nearly 600,000 removals by the end of the president’s first year, surpassing the 400,000 deportations that marked the peak for the Obama administration.

Since Trump returned to office, the White House has aggressively targeted the asylum system and tried to accelerate deportations. That has included an aggressive effort to shrink the case backlog in the immigration courts, which EOIR says has now dropped to less than 3.75 million cases from 4.18 million in January.

“The Trump administration knows that the backlog at the immigration courts is a huge obstacle to their mass deportation campaign,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration lawyer who works as an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. “They’re trying to speed up and close out as many of those cases as they can.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2F5b%2F21fbe7184081acd0c3be5da95154%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2232569993,N,,2025-12-29 14:57:09.942963

Lawyers Weekly Staff,,,,,https://masslawyersweekly.com/2025/12/29/immigration-u-visa-removal/,"On August 20, 2023, Ms. Oliveira was robbed and sexually assaulted on the streets of Boston, Massachusetts.
For Ms. Oliveira, the prospect may have been exceptionally daunting because she was then the subject of immigration proceedings.
“Under the VTVPA, cooperating victims like Ms. Oliveira are entitled to apply for what is known as a U visa.
“On January 30, 2025, DHS abruptly eliminated that benefit when Immigration & Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) announced that it would no longer ask its DHS-sister agency, U.S.
Each of these would constitute an independent basis to conclude that the issuance of the 2025 Policy was arbitrary and capricious.","Where a complaint has been filed challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s change in policy regarding the removal of “U Visa” applicants, a request by the plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction should be granted because their Administrative Procedure Act claim is particularly strong.

“Congress implemented the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (‘VTVPA’) to ‘strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence [and] sexual assault.’ …

“Plaintiff Lucia Goncalves Moreira Oliveira presents a tragic success story for the VTVPA. On August 20, 2023, Ms. Oliveira was robbed and sexually assaulted on the streets of Boston, Massachusetts. For any survivor of such an ordeal, the decision of whether to call the police is often fraught with difficulty, both because of the intense emotional charge of the situation and because of the considerable challenges in prosecuting crimes of that nature. Indeed, from 2020-2023, only 13% of sexual assaults in urban areas were ever reported. For Ms. Oliveira, the prospect may have been exceptionally daunting because she was then the subject of immigration proceedings. Many in her position might have felt understandably apprehensive about inviting law enforcement into the most sensitive parts of their life. But rather than let her attacker disappear into the night, Ms. Oliveira did the right thing: she contacted the authorities and has since fully cooperated with law enforcement. By doing so, she contributed to our collective safety. Indeed, a Boston Police detective has signed an affidavit attesting to Ms. Oliveira’s ongoing, active participation in their investigation.

“Under the VTVPA, cooperating victims like Ms. Oliveira are entitled to apply for what is known as a U visa. As set forth above, U visas serve a dual purpose: providing humanitarian relief to victims of abuse and facilitating those victims’ participation in criminal investigations, much to the benefit of our communities. And while an annual cap on U visas has unfortunately meant a years-long backlog of applications, the Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) has, until recently, ensured that qualifying individuals would not be removed while waiting for final relief.

“On January 30, 2025, DHS abruptly eliminated that benefit when Immigration & Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) announced that it would no longer ask its DHS-sister agency, U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (‘USCIS’), to decide whether a U visa application is ‘bona fide’ — meaning whether it satisfies the prima facie requirements for relief, plus national security and public safety background checks for the applicant — before executing the applicant’s order of removal. As a result, individuals with bona fide, yet unadjudicated, U visa applications — ‘victims of crimes committed against them in the United States, including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage,’ and more—suddenly find themselves unprotected from removal. Indeed, this is the exact position in which Ms. Oliveira finds herself. Ms. Oliveira’s U visa application was submitted to USCIS ten months ago, almost quintuple what Congress imagined as an appropriate length for deciding interim relief. Nevertheless, it has not been enough, and Ms. Oliveira’s application continues to be outstanding.

“Through their complaint, Ms. Oliveira and her husband ask the Court to find that the rescission of ICE’s prior policy and the institution of its new policy (hereinafter, the ‘2025 Policy’) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (‘APA’) and the Due Process Clause. In the interim, Plaintiffs ask the Court preliminarily to enjoin ICE from applying the 2025 Policy in their case. …

“On the merits, Plaintiffs’ APA claim is particularly strong. ICE’s announcement of the 2025 Policy summarily states that ‘it is the policy of the United States to achieve the ‘total and efficient enforcement of [immigration] laws.” But the VTVPA (including the availability of interim relief) is part of our immigration laws. It is thus unclear how its implementation could ever be at odds with DHS’s purported goal. Moreover, neither the announcement, nor the Executive Order it cites, gives any indication that DHS has considered how its new policy will impact the VTVPA’s law-enforcement and humanitarian aims, let alone the ‘serious reliance interests’ with which all agencies are required to reckon. …

“The other preliminary injunction factors weigh likewise in favor of relief. …

“For these reasons, and those stated herein, the Court will grant Plaintiffs’ motion and enjoin DHS from relying on the 2025 Policy in the administration of their removal. …

“The Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed, at a minimum, on their APA claim. The Court’s federal-question jurisdiction is not withdrawn under section 1252(g), and Plaintiffs are likely to show that the issuance of the 2025 Policy, including the rescission of the 2021 Policy, was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. …

“Plaintiffs assert that DHS’s issuance of the 2025 Policy was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. … Defendants make no meaningful counter. Nonetheless, the Court tests Plaintiffs’ APA claim and finds it substantial. …

“For purposes of this preliminary injunction, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs will be able to show that the 2025 Policy constitutes final agency action. …

“Finally, the Court turns to whether DHS’s decision to issue the 2025 Policy, rescinding the 2021 Policy, was arbitrary and capricious. As noted above, the announcement succinctly stated that ‘it is the policy of the United States to achieve the “total and efficient enforcement of [immigration] laws.”’ In turn, it cited an Executive Order more generally addressing ‘threats to national security and public safety’ and the ‘economic well-being of Americans.’ …

“Here, the record currently before the Court indicates that DHS ‘entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,’ … indeed one that was specifically and explicitly addressed by Congress through the VTVPA and subsequent legislation — that ‘women and children who are victims of [violent and sexual] crimes committed against them in the United States must be able to report these crimes to law enforcement and fully participate in the investigation of the crimes committed against them and the prosecution of the perpetrators of such crimes.’ Nowhere does DHS seem to recognize, let alone address, that withdrawing protections might chill non-citizen cooperation and ‘[weaken] the ability of law enforcement.’ …

“DHS highlights its interest in the ‘total and efficient enforcement of [immigration] laws,’ yet seems to forget that the VTVPA is one of those laws. …

“Based on the preliminary record, the Court finds that the 2025 Policy does not follow from DHS’s stated rationale. Moreover, it ignores congressional findings and closes its eyes to the effects on people like Plaintiffs. Each of these would constitute an independent basis to conclude that the issuance of the 2025 Policy was arbitrary and capricious. …

“The Court finds that, in the absence of an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm, including the lost opportunity to receive U visa interim relief. Defendants fault Plaintiffs for their delay in filing this suit. …

“The Court likewise finds that the balance of equities and public interest weigh in favor of relief. …

“For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction is granted. Pursuant to Rule 65(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court hereby preliminarily enjoins Defendants, their agents, and anyone acting in concert or participation with Defendants from implementing, instituting, maintaining, or giving effect to the 2025 Policy, including its rescission of the 2021 Policy, in any form with respect to Plaintiffs until further order issued by this Court.”

Alligator Alcatraz. Guns. Social media.

Legal battles about those and myriad other Florida issues remain unresolved heading into 2026. Here are 10 big legal issues to watch in the coming year:

ALLIGATOR ALCATRAZ: The immigrant-detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” has spawned a series of court battles since Florida opened the facility this summer. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in April in a case that alleges violations of a federal environmental law. Other cases involve issues such as detainees’ access to attorneys and whether the state has withheld public records.

BOOK FIGHTS: Publishing companies, authors and parents are challenging state and local education officials in federal lawsuits after books were removed from school libraries because of alleged improper content. For instance, a case at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a 2023 state law that led to books being removed. Two other pending lawsuits target Escambia County School Board decisions to remove or restrict access to books.

GUNS: Nearly eight years after the measure passed following the mass shooting at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether to take up the National Rifle Association’s challenge to a law that prevents people under age 21 from buying rifles and other long guns. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier has taken the unusual step of refusing to defend the law.

IMMIGRATION: A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in October about a law that created state crimes for undocumented immigrants who enter or reenter Florida. The state appealed after a U.S. district judge issued a preliminary injunction, ruling the 2025 law was likely preempted by federal immigration authority. It remains unclear when the appellate panel will issue a decision.

MARIJUANA: After falling short in 2024 of passing a constitutional amendment to allow recreational marijuana, the political committee Smart & Safe Florida wants to take the issue back to voters in 2026. But first, it needs to submit enough signatures and get Florida Supreme Court approval of the proposed ballot wording. The court review could turn into a fight, as Gov. Ron DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier oppose allowing recreational marijuana.

SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS: A U.S. district judge in 2026 is expected to rule on the constitutionality of a 2021 Florida law that placed restrictions on social media platforms, such as preventing the sites from banning political candidates. Tech industry groups challenged the law, which passed after Facebook and Twitter, now known as X, blocked President Donald Trump from their platforms after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

SOCIAL MEDIA RESTRICTIONS: Saying social media was harming children’s mental health, Florida lawmakers in 2024 passed a measure to prevent children under age 14 from opening accounts on certain platforms. Parents would have to give consent for 14- and 15-year-olds to have accounts on the platforms. Industry groups filed a First Amendment challenge and were backed by a district judge. The issue is pending at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

TRANSGENDER ISSUES: DeSantis’ administration and lawmakers in recent years have approved a series of measures aimed at transgender people, sparking legal battles. For example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the constitutionality of a state law and regulations that restrict treatments for people with gender dysphoria. It also is considering a challenge to a ban on Medicaid coverage for hormone therapy and puberty blockers.

UTILITY RATES: The state’s Office of Public Counsel and two consumer groups have gone to the Florida Supreme Court to challenge a decision by utility regulators to approve Tampa Electric Co. base-rate increases that began to take effect in 2025. Meanwhile, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups have indicated they likely will also challenge a November decision by regulators to approve a Florida Power & Light base-rate settlement.

WETLANDS: In a case closely watched by conservation and business groups, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is considering whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2020 improperly shifted permitting authority to Florida for projects that affect wetlands. A U.S. district judge sided with conservation groups that challenged the shift. Florida and business groups have defended giving authority to the state.

David Courvelle, 56, entered a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays.

Courvelle was a contract detention officer at the facility in Evangeline Parish managed by the GEO Group between Jan. 1 and July 30, according to court records.

Around Jan. 1, Courvelle allegedly began a personal, romantic and consensual relationship with a Nicaraguan ward at the detention center.

Between May and July 30, the document states, Courvelle had sexual contact multiple times with the detainee. He purchased gifts and food for the detainee, and gave her photographs of her daughter.

Courvelle allegedly arranged for other detainees to serve as lookouts while he and the detainee with the initials C.H. met in a janitorial closet, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Johnson said in court.

On July 16, Johnston said, staff at the detention center saw Courvelle and C.H. exiting the janitorial closet. Courvelle was transferred to another detention block and resigned after learning there were recordings of calls between him and C.H.

In a September interview with ICE representatives, Johnson said, Courvelle denied the activity, but about 30 minutes later admitted he had a relationship with C.H.

Courvelle is set to appear April 10, 2026, before Summerhays for sentencing.

He was released Monday on a $10,000 unsecured appearance bond.

Summerhays said Courvelle could face up to 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, supervised release of up to 3 years and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment.

The petitioners’ proposed group — ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ — is not meaningfully different from prior groups we have rejected that are defined by economic status or perceived wealth.
Instead, Lopez argues that her identity as a small business owner is an immutable characteristic core to her identity because it allowed her to escape the discrimination she suffered due to her dismembered finger and because the hardware business was a family business.
Because we affirm the BIA’s holding as to the asylum claims, we also reject the petitioners’ withholding of removal claims.","Where the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed an immigration judge’s order denying applications for asylum, the BIA’s decision should be upheld because the petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is based on a protected ground.

“Edwin David Ramos-Hernandez, his wife Sheyly Cristabel Lopez, and their minor daughter D.Z.R.L. petition for review of a December 11, 2024, decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’), which affirmed an Immigration Judge’s (‘IJ’) order denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (‘CAT’). … We deny the petition and explain why the agency’s ruling was supported by substantial evidence and committed no error of law. …

“Ramos-Hernandez, Lopez, and D.Z.R.L. are citizens of Guatemala who entered the United States on September 8, 2021. …

“We turn first to the petitioners’ asylum applications. …

“Substantial evidence supports the IJ’s determinations against the petitioners. The petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is on account of a protected ground, so their asylum claims must fail. …

“The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ’s determinations that ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ is not a cognizable [particular social group (PSG)] and that the petitioners had failed to show a nexus between the harm they experienced and their second proposed PSG, ‘the Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez nuclear family.’ …

“This court has held that proposed PSGs similar to ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ are not cognizable because they are overly broad and do not implicate an immutable characteristic. …

“We reject the petitioners’ arguments that they fall into exceptions to these rulings. The petitioners’ proposed group — ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ — is not meaningfully different from prior groups we have rejected that are defined by economic status or perceived wealth. The petitioners do not address this caselaw. Instead, Lopez argues that her identity as a small business owner is an immutable characteristic core to her identity because it allowed her to escape the discrimination she suffered due to her dismembered finger and because the hardware business was a family business. However, the record does not compel the conclusion that being a small business owner was fundamental to Lopez’s identity because she studied to be and initially sought employment as a teacher in Guatemala, and she has since worked at a daycare and as a house cleaner in the United States. The petitioners further argue that if their identities as small business owners were not immutable, they ‘would not have operated the business, even as the extortion demands and threats began.’ This argument is circular and, in any event, they testified that they did close down the business shortly after the extortion began.

“Substantial evidence also supports the IJ’s determination that the petitioners failed to establish a nexus between their experienced harm and their membership in the ‘Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez nuclear family.’ The record reflects that the family was extorted because they operated a successful hardware business, not because of kinship itself. Lopez’s own testimony confirms this point, as she was concerned about returning to Guatemala because there ‘have been a lot of attacks happening’ and ‘there is a lot of violence’ — not because of her status as a Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez family member. As our caselaw has repeatedly established, the mere fact that members of the same family were harmed does not establish that the family connection was a central motivation for the suffered harm. …

“Additionally, the agency did not err in finding that the petitioners had not been targeted on account of their anti-gang political views. …

“The BIA also did not err in affirming the IJ’s determination that petitioners failed to establish past persecution. …

“Here, the evidence consists of two to three relatively vague threats and one physical attack that may or may not have been connected to those threats. The IJ had reason to believe that the attack against Ramos-Hernandez was not necessarily related to the prior extortion, particularly given the inconsistency in the record over when the incident occurred and the lack of evidence regarding motive. This court has found that even more severe situations did not constitute persecution. …

“Similarly, substantial evidence supports that the petitioners failed to establish a well founded fear of future persecution. … Given that the petitioners closed their store and remained in Guatemala for approximately two years after receiving the threats with no further incidents, they have not presented credible, direct, and specific evidence supporting a fear of individualized future persecution. Because they have not established membership in a PSG, the petitioners also have not shown a pattern or practice of persecution of a similarly situated group on account of a protected ground. …

“… The petitioners here have not presented additional specific evidence explaining why they cannot relocate, beyond general conditions of corruption and violence in Guatemala. …

“The burden of proof required for withholding of removal is higher than that for asylum. Therefore, ‘a noncitizen who cannot meet the lower asylum standard will necessarily fail to make out a counterpart claim under the higher standard for withholding of removal.’ López-Pérez v. Garland, 26 F.4th 104, 111 (1st Cir. 2022). Because we affirm the BIA’s holding as to the asylum claims, we also reject the petitioners’ withholding of removal claims. …

“As to their CAT claims, the agency correctly determined that the petitioners did not meet their burden of presenting a preponderance of the evidence showing that if they returned to Guatemala, they ‘would be subject to torture by or with the acquiescence of a government official.’ … Substantial evidence supported the IJ’s conclusion that there was no objectively reasonable basis to believe that the petitioners would be harmed at all upon their return to Guatemala, given that they lived peacefully without incident for more than a year after closing their business. In light of that finding, the record does not compel the conclusion that the petitioners would face torture by anyone upon their return. Similarly, the IJ’s factual finding in the context of the petitioners’ asylum claims that they had failed to establish that relocation in Guatemala would be unreasonable also supports denial of their CAT claims. …

“For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the decision of the BIA is denied.”

While community defense efforts in large urban metropolises such as Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and Portland have attracted the most media coverage, anti-ICE activity is also thriving in Republican-controlled states like Texas and North Carolina.

Many grassroots groups in conservative-leaning states are documenting their own work on Instagram, using social media accounts as hubs to update local communities on ICE activity, recruit volunteers, and announce trainings. They may face a more challenging terrain than those organizing in Democratic-controlled states, given the active collaboration of law enforcement agencies with ICE.

While red state anti-ICE organizing may be less likely to feature whistles, bullhorns, and other confrontational tactics seen in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, common themes are emerging, consistent with organizing in liberal cities. The anti-ICE playbook in red states involves creating a hotline for residents to report ICE activity, “Know Your Rights” sessions that give people legal advice on what information they should withhold when confronted by ICE, and ICE-watch trainings for observers documenting arrests. Many groups are also ensuring that the families of those arrested and detained have legal and financial support.

This non-comprehensive roundup of anti-ICE activities is an indication of how widespread resistance to fascism became in 2025.

North Carolina

In North Carolina cities such as Raleigh and Charlotte, a grassroots organization called Siembra NC is leading efforts to protect community members from ICE. Siembra NC was founded in 2017 in direct response to the first Trump administration and offers a hotline for residents reporting ICE arrests, as well as abusive employers and landlords. If ICE agents attempt to enter people’s home or car, Siembra NC advises locking the door and starting a livestream on social media to document the interaction.

In an Instagram post in mid-November, Siembra NC also documented its members showing up outside grocery stores in Charlotte when ICE agents arrested shoppers. Volunteers who were trained as part of Siembra NC’s “Safe to Work, Safe to School” patrols ensured that those being arrested were informed of their right to remain silent and knew not to sign any documents.

In a piece for Teen Vogue, Siembra NC’s co-executive director Nikki Marín Baena explained how her organization began training people in the parking lots of immigrant neighborhoods on how to identify ICE agents. “After a volunteer confirmed an officer’s identity, they would alert neighbors to the agent’s presence, and our dispatch team would send a text message to our contacts in the area,” she wrote. Siembra NC’s efforts are effective. According to Baena, “in every case we worked on, when the agents realized they were being watched, they abandoned their stakeout.”

Having learned how to respond to anti-immigrant attacks in Trump’s first term, Siembra NC has published a downloadable playbook as part of its “Defend and Recruit” campaign, and on July 23, held a virtual event specifically designed for organizers in red states engaged in ICE-watch activities.

Pennsylvania

The People’s Defense Front (PDF) in Northern Appalachia, which is located in central Pennsylvania, offers community defense trainings against “police violence, landlord cruelty, white supremacists and abusive bigots.” Its Instagram account documents the August 19 arrests of 26 workers by ICE agents and state troopers. Labeling the effort as “Know Your Enemy,” PDF published photos of those armed agents and asked community members for help in identifying them.

PDF offers a Centre County Rapid Response Network hotline for community members to report ICE activity, and recruits volunteers to sign up for and get trained in conducting anti-ICE patrols. “We patrol every morning and night,” said the group in an online post, and “maintain close contact with workers and the community.”

PDF is also collaborating with the Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) in State College where Penn State’s campus is located, and where ICE activity was documented in July 2025. SCDS explained in a post that, “In confronting ICE through our patrols, we raise the cost of ICE’s violence with the aim to undercut their power and deter their presence in the area.”

Texas

In Dallas and Fort Worth, Vecinos Unidos DFW is holding “Know Your Rights” and ICE-watch trainings, and organizing people by neighborhoods. “People who know both how to defend their rights and how immigration agents are operating nearby are less likely to be separated from their families,” said the group on Instagram. Like many other organizations, they have a community defense hotline that people can call to report ICE activity.

Vecinos Unidos DFW also began a court watch program after immigrants were arrested when they showed up to their court dates. The grassroots organization is calling on local residents to be present at immigration hearings. “With ICE activity picking up in our area,” said Vecinos Unidos DFW on Instagram, “it’s crucial to stay vigilant and learn our rights to protect ourselves and our neighbors.” The group is also organizing people to prevent Dallas police from cooperating with ICE agents, and raising funds as mutual aid for immigrant families who have been separated by detention and deportation.

Alabama

The Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, along with other organizations local to Birmingham, has set up an ICE-watch program called Bham Migra Watch, alerting local communities of the locations, times, and dates of ICE arrests.

In September 2025, after dozens of people were arrested in Russellville, Franklin County, on their way to work, the group urged people to call their hotline with any information or requests for legal and other help.

Bham Migra Watch also informs residents of their rights if they are approached by ICE agents, and recruits volunteers to sign up for trainings for “all Birmingham friends interested in fighting against ICE aggression,” and for those located in Montgomery and Montevallo to “fight for the community around you.”

Florida

Defensa Gulf Coast is a Florida-centered effort in and around Pensacola, describing itself as a group “formed to defend our immigrant neighbors against the racist deportation machine.” Operating out of the “Pensacola Liberation Center,” Defensa Gulf Coast has participated in efforts to shut down the notorious immigrant jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” and, like other groups, established a hotline to report ICE sightings.

Tennessee

An effort centered in Nashville called Music City Migra Watch is encouraging local residents to carefully document ICE activity and send it to them. The group conducts ICE-watch and court-watch trainings “meant to empower our community, build safety, and support those who need it most.” It also supports trainings in surrounding localities including Springfield, Murfreesboro, and Mount Juliet. Beyond local community defense, Music City Migra Watch is leading a boycott of Avelo Airlines, a company known for collaborating with ICE to transport arrested immigrants.

Looking Toward Resistance in 2026

Given the increasing number of U.S. citizens caught in ICE’s dragnet, organizers are warning that attacks on immigrants are just the beginning. Siembra NC’s Baena issued a challenge to those who want ICE out of their communities, saying, “How many of us would it take to put the focus on the attacks that will touch nearly every American, not simply those terrorizing immigrants?”

After a year of ICE violence, groups like hers are bracing themselves for increased staffing at the federal agency and a greater armed presence on city streets. The 2025 “Know Your Rights” sessions and trainings on anti-ICE defense offer a strong foundation for local communities to ramp up activism in many forms. “We are more ready than ever if ICE accomplishes its goal of hiring 600 percent more officers,” said Baena.

And readiness means expanding activities from the streets to the halls of power. “In 2026 we are going to switch from ‘defense’ to ‘offense,’ ensuring we don’t simply watch out for ICE agents but create the conditions necessary to hold elected officials accountable for guaranteeing dignity for everyone in our state,” Baena promised.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2246351093.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:57:12.372348

Shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Doan, a staunch Democrat, lost his job as a software engineer with a company that produces video game competitions.","How has President Trump done over the course of 2025?

For some voters, 2025 was a great year for the country. For others, it was a depressing, unaffordable slog. And one person definitely regretted his vote.

The Times asked voters whom we have followed over the last 18 months just what they thought of the last year.

Almost everyone agreed that the year was big and chaotic. After that, they splinter in some interesting and surprising ways.

The mayor of the small border town of Roma, Jaime Escobar Jr. said he believes Mr. Trump has made strides in his first year in office to control border crossings.

Mr. Escobar, a longtime Democrat, voted for Mr. Trump after years of what he described as chaos at the border.

“I think Trump is doing a good job,” he said. “He just needs more time.”

When it comes to the economy, he said he is confident that Mr. Trump can improve affordability if Republicans can keep control of Congress after the midterms. Gas prices, he said, have already come down.

“I see steady progress,” Mr. Escobar said.

Mr. Escobar is not without criticism.

“I’ve always been very pro-law enforcement,” he said. But he added that he is troubled by some of the videos and photographs of ICE agents aggressively detaining migrants. He hopes to see more humane treatment of migrants with long ties to the United States who do not have criminal records.

— Edgar Sandoval

“The only thing that matters to him is himself.”

Erwin McKone, 55, Flint, Mich.

Erwin McKone, who works in agribusiness sales, voted for Mr. Trump last November, a bit reluctantly. He describes himself as a moderate who felt Democrats had failed to control the southern border.

But he is alarmed over Mr. Trump’s actions in 2025.

Mr. McKone said he thinks the administration’s approach to border security has been needlessly draconian.

His top concerns, however, are the president’s rhetoric, narcissism and the transactional nature of his politics, he said. “The only thing that matters to him is himself,” he said. “And then maybe the people who pay the bills.”

He worries about what the years ahead may bring. “There are times that I struggle to remain positive when I look at this administration and how the United States and our Constitution and Congress and the Senate are changing,” he said.

— Ernesto Londoño

Matthew Dugie, a union construction worker, agonized over his vote before casting his ballot for Kamala Harris. He regretted it almost immediately.

“I wasted a vote,” he said.

He is a rare voter — a 2020 Trump supporter who voted for Ms. Harris in 2024.

But he is largely happy with Mr. Trump’s approach to his second term. He gives Mr. Trump credit for imposing tariffs to try to bring back domestic manufacturing, and said he feels that a bold chief executive is now running the country.

“He’s got answers, and he’s got direction, and he’s more of a leader,” Mr. Dugie said.

He disagrees with Mr. Trump’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean and does not want to see the United States start a war in Venezuela.

But he has plenty of construction work from hospitals and data centers, and says his retirement account is up about 11 percent since last year.

And this year, he said, he even indulged in a four-day trip to Las Vegas.

— Jack Healy

“I think it’s going to be a long three years.”

Sharon Reed, 78, with her husband, Bob Reed, 79, Central Pennsylvania

For Bob and Sharon Reed, both retired schoolteachers, the issue with Mr. Trump all along has been less about what he plans to do and more about how he does it.

They are Republicans, and mostly agree with the president’s goals, like shrinking the government and strengthening the border. That is why they voted for him, with reservations.

But it’s Mr. Trump’s bulldozing style that is their problem: the scale and speed of his actions, the rhetoric that accompanies them and the turmoil that inevitably follows.

The Reeds, for instance, support weeding out government fraud, but Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency “didn’t go after the fraud,” Ms. Reed said. “They just fired people.”

They support strengthened immigration enforcement, but not ICE’s aggressive tactics that meant “some innocent people get swept up with it,” Mr. Reed said.

Their list goes on.

Still Mr. Reed is, on balance, pleased enough. “I think he’s trying to work for the betterment of the country,” Mr. Reed said.

Ms. Reed is not so pleased.

She does not regret her vote, given her options, but she just keenly hopes for better choices the next time around.

“I think it’s going to be a long three years,” she said.

— Campbell Robertson

Though she voted for Kamala Harris, Veronica McCloud believed Mr. Trump deserved support from all Americans and she was willing to give him a chance.

Ms. McCloud, a retired English teacher, said she even found herself agreeing with some of the president’s decisions. But his manner was the issue. Ms. McCloud, for instance, supported trimming government waste, but thought the widespread firing of federal employees was callous and reckless. She believes in securing the country’s borders and deporting criminals, but the images of ICE agents aggressively rounding up immigrants, including children, left her heartbroken.

“So much fighting and pointing fingers,” she said. “And the president is always blaming Biden, always looking backward.”

“I am disappointed, particularly with the way he speaks to women and women of color,” she added. “The name calling has to stop.”

She said she has been most affected by the rising cost of food. She rarely buys beef now.

“Going to the grocery store is miserable,” she said. “I find myself going aisle by aisle and saying ‘I will wait on this for the next paycheck.’”

“I wish we could have a president that is doing what Trump is doing, but one that is not so divisive.”

Perry Hunter, 56, Sellersburg, Ind.

Perry Hunter, a high school teacher who voted for Mr. Trump, has been pleased with nearly all of the president’s decisions, including the aggressive way he has handled deportations, his demolition of the East Wing of the White House and his attacks on Venezuelan boats allegedly carrying drugs.

And he said that Democrats just don’t want to agree with Mr. Trump on anything.

“If he said drinking Drano was bad for you, there would be people going on to drink Drano, just to prove him wrong,” he said.

But he doesn’t like that Mr. Trump has been rude — especially when commenting about the killing of the filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.

“I wish we could have a president that is doing what Trump is doing,” he said, “but one that is not so divisive.”

— Juliet Macur

Annabelle Collins, an independent who supported Ms. Harris, has mixed feelings about the past year. “Not every aspect was horrible,” she said.

As a Venezuelan immigrant who moved to the United States as a child, she is against the Trump administration’s tactics for detaining undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for decades.

“There has to be a better way to do those things,” Ms. Collins, 37, said.

At the same time, she said, President Trump’s aggressive immigration policy has helped her husband, who is a border patrol agent.

“I know he’s in a safer place,” she said.

— Christina Morales

“It’s been slow change.”

Charles Vaughters, 25, Laramie, Wyo.

Charles Vaughters, a Marine veteran and college student who considers himself conservative, says that the country has improved — but just “marginally.”

“It’s been slow change,” he said. “It takes a long time to steer the ship.”

He said Mr. Trump could do a better job at deporting migrants who arrived in the country illegally and that ICE “needs to ramp up its numbers.”

He also does not support Mr. Trump’s decision in September to continue H-1B visas, meant for foreign workers who fill specialized roles, even with a new $100,000 fee per worker.

He thinks the program should be ended. His friends who are computer science majors, he said, are worried about finding jobs.

“I don’t think Trump’s ever going to do that,” he said, “because he has a lot of friends in big tech who benefit immensely from that program.”

— Juliet Macur

When asked what words sum up the first year of the second Trump term, Sam Consiglio did not hesitate.

“Uncertainty, confusion and disorderly,” said Ms. Consiglio, 22, a moderate Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. “In the past year, we don’t really know what to expect as citizens.”

On top of that, she added, “a lot of the problems that we had a year ago are still problems today,” citing the price of groceries.

But the tone from the White House troubles her most. To Ms. Consiglio, a president should be a steadying force: “One who calms those nerves,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s behavior, however, is “very different from what you would expect from a president.”

— Kurt Streeter

For Thien Doan, there is no doubt that life feels much worse than it was a year ago. Shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Doan, a staunch Democrat, lost his job as a software engineer with a company that produces video game competitions. To save money, he rented out his condo and moved in with family. It took him about six months to land a new position, but he still has not moved back into his own home.

“The job market out there is just really, really bad.”

The lawmakers warned that the proposed rule would create widespread fear and confusion within immigrant communities, leading families to avoid medical care, nutrition assistance and housing support even when they qualify under federal law.
The lawmakers cited recent legislation, including the 2025 reconciliation law, which deliberately preserved access to key public programs for specific immigrant populations.
For these reasons, the legislators urged the Trump administration to abandon the proposed rule and retain the 2022 regulations that align with congressional intent, protect public health and ensure that families are not punished for accessing lawful, life sustaining assistance.
Several New York City agencies have also publicly condemned the proposed rule, citing concerns about its potential impact on public health, housing stability and immigrant well being.","Senior immigration leaders in the United States Senate and House of Representatives have strongly criticized a proposed rule by President Donald Trump that would penalize Caribbean and other immigrant families for lawfully accessing health care, food assistance and housing support.

In a formal regulatory comment submitted to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the lawmakers opposed the proposed Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility rule, warning that it unlawfully rewrites longstanding immigration law and would discourage immigrant families from using essential public benefits to which they are legally entitled.

The comment was submitted by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security and Enforcement, Congressman Robert Scott, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Senator Dick Durbin, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Alex Padilla, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden.

The lawmakers argued that the proposal seeks to bypass congressional authority by altering the definition of public charge, a term that for more than one hundred and thirty five years has applied only to individuals who are primarily dependent on government assistance for subsistence. They warned that a public charge determination can directly affect an immigrant’s eligibility to enter or remain in the United States.

According to the legislators, the Trump administration’s proposal would penalize immigrants for using supplemental benefits such as health care, nutrition assistance and housing programs that Congress intentionally made available to support working families. They stated that the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to administratively redefine public charge in violation of congressional intent, despite repeated legislative decisions rejecting such changes.

The members noted that Congress has revised immigration law multiple times without ever expanding the definition of public charge to include the lawful use of non cash benefits. They emphasized that federal agencies have long recognized programs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and housing assistance as tools that promote public health, food security and housing stability, enabling families to remain economically self sufficient.

The lawmakers warned that the proposed rule would create widespread fear and confusion within immigrant communities, leading families to avoid medical care, nutrition assistance and housing support even when they qualify under federal law. They noted that the Department of Homeland Security itself acknowledged in the proposed rule that the policy could result in poorer health outcomes, increased poverty, housing instability and greater reliance on emergency rooms for basic care. These impacts, they said, would extend beyond immigrant households to affect communities across the United States.

They further stated that Congress has consistently determined immigrant access to public benefits through eligibility rules rather than by penalizing individuals for adjusting their immigration status based on lawful benefit use. The lawmakers cited recent legislation, including the 2025 reconciliation law, which deliberately preserved access to key public programs for specific immigrant populations.

For these reasons, the legislators urged the Trump administration to abandon the proposed rule and retain the 2022 regulations that align with congressional intent, protect public health and ensure that families are not punished for accessing lawful, life sustaining assistance.

Zachary Segal, a BU undergraduate student, became the target of harassment after posting on X that he contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to report what he believed to be violations of federal immigration law.

There is nothing unlawful about reporting suspected violations of federal law. Yet, thousands of individuals, including fellow BU students, sent Mr. Segal threatening messages and covered campus with posters labeling Segal a “racist and fascist.” One poster displayed across the campus states that people like Segal have “no place” on BU’s campus.

Mr. Segal received multiple death threats, including messages stating, “If I ever see you i’m [expletive] killing you and leaving ur dead body on the sidewalk”; “I’ll be waiting outside your little event tonight”; and “We’re coming for you.” One message referenced the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, threatening, “Here’s to hoping you’re the next to get Kirked.”

Rather than defend Segal, Boston University instructed Segal not to attend classes and placed the burden on him to arrange academic accommodations himself, effectively admitting it could not ensure his safety on campus. At the same time, BU officials issued critical public statements and refused to condemn the threats or announce concrete safety measures.

Boston University’s response violates its duty of care under Massachusetts law and contradicts its own published commitments to protect free expression and protect students from harassment. Because the University has acknowledged it cannot safely accommodate Mr. Segal in Boston, AFL has demanded a reasonable accommodation — allowing him to transfer to Boston University’s Washington, D.C. program for the remainder of his education.

“Universities cannot claim to support free speech while allowing students to face death threats for expressing political opinions,” said Emily Percival, Senior Counsel at America First Legal. “Boston University must protect its students, not force them into hiding.”

America First Legal will continue to fight for accountability when institutions abandon their legal obligations and allow intimidation to quell free expression.

The Trump administration has appealed the California and Oregon rulings to the 9th U.S.","The Supreme Court last week decided not to overrule a lower court decision that blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.

Justices on Dec. 23 declined the Trump administration’s emergency request to overturn the earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry. In her ruling, Perry said the Trump administration had no power to use troops to support its immigration crackdown.

Last Tuesday’s ruling was the second defeat for the president’s effort to send troops to assist in its anti-immigration campaign. An appeals court earlier also refused to overturn Perry’s ruling.

Justices heard arguments in the case more than two months ago. The high court order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.

“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the high court majority wrote.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, said he narrowly agreed with the decision to keep the Chicago deployment blocked.

Three conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — publicly dissented.

The outcome was a rare Supreme Court setback for Trump, who had won repeated victories in emergency appeals since he resumed residence in the White House in January.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker applauded Tuesday’s decision as a win for the state and country.

“American cities, suburbs, and communities should not have to face masked federal agents asking for their papers, judging them for how they look or sound, and living in fear that the President can deploy the military to their streets,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended Trump’s decision to activate the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property from “violent rioters.”

Alito and Thomas said in their dissent that the court had no basis to reject Trump’s contention that the administration needed the troops to enforce immigration laws. Gorsuch said he would have narrowly sided with the government based on the declarations of federal law enforcement officials.

The administration originally sought the order to allow the deployment of 300 troops from Illinois and 200 from Texas.

The Trump administration argued that the troops were needed “to protect federal personnel and property from violent resistance against the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

In her ruling, Perry wrote that she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois and no reason to believe the protests there had gotten in the way of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Perry initially blocked deployment for two weeks. But in October, she extended the order indefinitely while the Supreme Court reviewed the case.

The Illinois case is the first one of several state legal challenges over National Guard deployments to be ruled on by the high court.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb is suing to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen in the nation’s capital.

A federal judge in Oregon has permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there, and all 200 troops from California were being sent home from Oregon, an official said.

A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis.

In California, a lower court judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal.

The Trump administration has appealed the California and Oregon rulings to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",https://southwestregionalpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thumbnail-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:57:42.700414

Our Investment Funds Team breaks down the potential impact of the Court’s decision on funds and market participants.

The ruling could increase litigation risk for funds and fund sponsors

Investors could challenge a wide range of fund contracts, including governance and advisory arrangements

The lack of clear time limits could expose older agreements to renewed challenges

On December 10, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund Ltd. to resolve a circuit split over whether investors have a private right of action under Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The case centers on closed-end fund bylaws adopting Maryland “control-share” voting limitations and has broad implications for funds that fall, directly and indirectly, under the 1940 Act.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether Section 47(b) of the 1940 Act includes an implied private right of action allowing private litigants to seek rescission of contracts that allegedly violate the 1940 Act. The question comes to the Court following decisions in the Second Circuit that recognize a private right of action, in contrast to decisions from the Third and Ninth Circuits, which have found no private right of action under Section 47(b).

By resolving this circuit split, the Court’s decision could materially affect investors’ ability to sue funds directly over allegedly unlawful contracts.

Litigation Background

The dispute stems from challenges brought by Saba Capital to several closed-end funds organized under Maryland law. Those funds adopted bylaws opting into certain voting rights provisions under the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act (MCSAA). Under the MCSAA, once a shareholder acquires at least 10% of a fund’s shares, the shareholder is prohibited from voting shares above that threshold unless two-thirds of the remaining shareholders affirmatively approve the additional voting rights.

Saba Capital filed a declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of New York, asserting that the voting rights provisions violated Section 18(i) of the 1940 Act, which requires that every share of stock issued by a fund subject to the Act be a voting stock with equal voting rights.

Before Saba’s suit, the Second Circuit held as an issue of first impression in Oxford University Bank v. Lansuppe Feeder LLC that the 1940 Act contains an implied private right of action for rescission under Section 47(b). Relying on that precedent, the district court granted summary judgment in Saba’s favor, rescinded the challenged contracts, and found that the voting rights provisions violated the 1940 Act. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, creating a split with the Third and Ninth Circuits.

Key Legal Issues Before the Court

The Supreme Court granted review to decide whether Section 47(b) of the 1940 Act contains an implied private right of action for rescission.

Recent Supreme Court precedent has closely scrutinized statutory language and required unambiguous congressional intent to create a private right of action. The Court may also address the applicability of its decision in Transamerica Mortgage Advisors v. Lewis, which found an implied right of action for rescission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a statute enacted with the 1940 Act.

The parties and amici have advanced competing views on whether Section 47(b) supports a private right of action.

Potential Implications for Market Participants

A decision recognizing a private right of action under Section 47(b) could materially expand funds’ litigation exposure. As amici, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have argued to the Supreme Court, with an implied private right of action, private litigants would likely have the opportunity to challenge a vast array of an investment company’s contracts, including governance documents and bylaws, advisory and sub-advisory agreements, securities issuances, and contracts with service providers and other third parties.

The decision could also affect shareholder engagement dynamics for closed-end funds and business development companies (BDCs) and could indirectly affect private fund structures if 1940 Act provisions are implicated. Because Section 47(b) does not contain a statute of limitations, there is a significant risk that companies could face retrospective rescission and related collateral consequences. For long-standing companies, assessing this risk may require examination of its internal structures, investment history, and contractual arrangements.

Bottom Line

The Supreme Court’s decision in FS Credit Opportunities could significantly reshape the enforcement landscape under the 1940 Act by either opening or closing the door to private rescission claims under Section 47(b). Registered funds, BDCs, private fund complexes, and their counterparties should consider proactively assessing contractual portfolios, governance frameworks, and disclosure practices to prepare for either outcome and be ready to implement responsive measures once the decision is issued.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:26.329973

I ...,Guardian staff,,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/filipino-healthcare-workers-immigration-trump,"The large number of Filipinos in healthcare work includes undocumented people, who fill workforce gaps and care for ailing people.
Amid heightened levels of immigration arrests, many Filipino healthcare workers say they are providing essential care while in the grips of anxiety over their own safety.
She understands intimately the fear and vulnerabilities of the undocumented community.
By the 1970s, Filipino healthcare workers were being trained and exported to the US as skilled labor, said Valerie Francisco-Menchavez, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University and author of Caring for Caregivers: Filipina Migrant Workers and Community Building During Crisis.
‘We care about people’ Healthcare workers know better than anyone what it means to live on borrowed time.","In the Philippines, she spent three years providing end-of-life care for a family’s grandmother. When the grandmother died, family members told the healthcare worker to arrange her own way to the United States, where they operated home healthcare facilities.

In California, they promised, she would have a place to stay and a stable job. They would look after her just as she had cared for their grandmother.

In 2018, the caregiver – who asked to be identified as Bella – arrived in Los Angeles on a tourist visa. She imagined herself working in healthcare facilities tucked in verdant hills or in beach communities.

Instead, Bella, 57, said she landed in a shadow network of home healthcare jobs. She was shuttled among multiple facilities to avoid compliance checks and paid a fraction of a living wage. One job lasted eight months, she said, and paid $30 a day for 24-hour patient care.

“I’m thinking: ‘How could I live with that situation?’” said Bella. In Filipino culture, the concept of utang na loob, or a deep-seated sense of obligation to repay kindness, kept Bella tied to the family that she said ultimately exploited her labor and left her undocumented in the US.

To break free, Bella lived in a church for months. Many in the same situation fall deeper into the cracks of a system ripe for abuse, but Bella eventually joined a workers’ rights group that provided immigration and social services. She now earns just enough as a part-time independent home caregiver to pay taxes and rent a small room with a one-window view.

That fragile sense of stability has been shaken by news of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arresting people who look like her at workplaces and at immigration check-in appointments.

“It’s too much,” Bella said about the anxiety of the ICE arrests. She limits trips outside of home for essentials – which include work – because patients rely on her care.

In the US healthcare system, Filipinos make up a large percentage of the workforce – 4% of registered nurses are of Filipino descent, which is more than double the Filipino American population, according to National Nurses United.

The large number of Filipinos in healthcare work includes undocumented people, who fill workforce gaps and care for ailing people. Approximately 2% of undocumented immigrants in the US are from the Philippines, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.

Amid heightened levels of immigration arrests, many Filipino healthcare workers say they are providing essential care while in the grips of anxiety over their own safety.

ICE agents have walked past Veronica Velasquez, a physical therapist, in the hallways of the Los Angeles hospital where she works. Her heart raced each time. The Philippines native was brought to the US when she was 11 years old and granted temporary protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. She understands intimately the fear and vulnerabilities of the undocumented community.

“This is a hospital that’s supposed to be for the community, and it does not feel safe,” said Velasquez, 33. “This is supposed to be a healing space. This is supposed to feel like a space where I should feel safe. This is my place of work, and it 100% does not feel that way.”

A history written in care

The presence of Filipinos in the US healthcare industry is part of a centuries-long history tracing back to the US occupation of the Philippines.

In the mid-20th century, nursing education exchange programs were set up between the US and the Philippines. By the 1970s, Filipino healthcare workers were being trained and exported to the US as skilled labor, said Valerie Francisco-Menchavez, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University and author of Caring for Caregivers: Filipina Migrant Workers and Community Building During Crisis.

Many schools and universities in the Philippines today offer nursing programs that help graduates find healthcare jobs in other countries. In the US, Filipino caregivers are part of the backbone of a healthcare system facing critical labor gaps, said Aquilina Soriano Versoza, founder and executive director of the Pilipino Workers Center of Southern California.

“[Caregivers] wouldn’t be coming here if there weren’t the need for the labor,” said Versoza.

Some immigrate on skilled worker visas or, like Bella, overstay tourist visas. Both paths leave caregivers vulnerable, especially since many support families back home.

Christina Fadriga knows the trade-offs. To provide for her four children, she made the solo journey to the US in 2006 to work as a caregiver.

“I’m proud to be a caregiver in America,” said Fadriga, 60. But lately, the ICE raids have put her caregiving community on edge. As a green card holder, Fadriga is required to split her time between the US and the Philippines to maintain her permanent resident status. Her children are grown now, but she always feels torn about her nomadic existence – especially now.

There’s a lot of fear in the community, said Fadriga. Fed by news and social media posts about ICE arrests and detentions – which have included permanent residents and US citizens – friends advised her not to return to the US.

Others urged her not to be afraid.

“But how can you not be afraid?” said Fadriga.

‘We care about people’

Healthcare workers know better than anyone what it means to live on borrowed time.

“Today you’re sick. Tomorrow, it could be someone else. The next day, it could be my mom or me,” said Angelica Mateo, a licensed vocational nurse and a contract specialist with SEIU-UHW at Kaiser Permanente’s Los Angeles area clinics.

Mateo, who immigrated as a child and became a US citizen in 2021, said her immigrant background made her especially attuned to patients’ anxieties.

“We got into this career because we care about people,” said Mateo, 39. “We never did it with the mentality of, like: ‘I’m going to be the best nurse for citizens only.’”

Almost 60,000 people are in ICE detention, according to federal data. In one case, a longtime green card holder was detained at a Seattle airport after visiting the Philippines.

Such stories ripple quickly through the Filipino American community, where being undocumented has its own unofficial name in Tagalog: “TNT” – tago ng tago, or “always hiding”.

Velasquez, the LA physical therapist, tries to be a reassuring presence for this community in hiding. She posts videos explaining patients’ rights and how to seek support if treating patients under ICE detention.

“We are human beings, just like any other citizen or non-citizen,” said Velasquez. “We are just here trying to survive, just like everyone else.”

Living and working in the grips of heightened immigration enforcement has taken a toll on Bella’s mental health, especially in hiding. Sometimes she imagines speaking directly with leaders in charge of immigration policies.

In those times, she imagines asking a simple question: do you have elderly parents or children who need care?

If so, chances are, in those homes, domestic workers just like her are performing most of the household care duties.

So, where is the utang na loob or sense of obligation to repay kindness for this kind of essential work?

“Most of the caregivers who are here, we are not here to harm America,” said Bella. “We are a help in this country.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80f0cecb67b81c6ae7571782c25a19e4a1884cf8/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71bf6fe789bd4050bf4797aa7227cee8",N,,2025-12-29 11:12:10.457576

Much recent commentary has suggested that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power – especially under President Donald Trump. The Niskanen Center, for example, contends that the court “is enabling Trump’s executive authority,” while the Brennan Center argues that the court has given “the president the power of a king.” But is this narrative supported by the empirical record? At the very least, is the Roberts court more deferential to presidential power than past courts? Our preliminary answer, like much else having to do with this court, is that it’s complicated.

What we looked at

The Supreme Court’s treatment of cases involving the presidency has long interested scholars of separation of powers. Indeed, research shows that justices who were appointed by the current president tend to favor that executive at higher rates than other justices. Other work examines how the court responds to perceived presidential overreach, finding that institutional constraints on executive power vary with the court’s composition.

This is in line with what is known as the attitudinal model, which suggests that judicial behavior reflects ideological preferences rather than neutral legal reasoning; in other words, that justices vote in favor of presidents with whose political ideology they agree. Along those lines, recent empirical work has demonstrated that partisan polarization affects judicial decision-making, with the justices increasingly dividing along party lines in politically salient cases.

This analysis builds on these foundations by examining support for the United States as a party on the merits docket. Support rates are calculated as the percentage of votes cast in favor of the United States’ position based on underlying data from the Supreme Court Database. Specifically, the analysis examines these rates across chief justice eras, by the political party of the appointing president, and by individual justices through the end of the 2024-2025 term.

Historical patterns: the long view

Figure 1, below, shows the number of cases involving the United States per term from 1803 through 2024. The pattern reveals dramatic growth through the early 20th century, peaking at 79 cases in the 1891 term during the court of Chief Justice Melville Fuller (1888-1910). This expansion reflected the growing reach of federal power and the court’s expanding docket. The mid-20th century saw continued high volumes, with the court of Chief Justice Earl Warren (1953-1969) often having over 40 such cases per term. Since the early 1980s, however, the overall number of cases has declined substantially as the court has reduced its total docket, although cases involving the United States remain a significant portion of the court’s work.

Figure 2, below, displays the total number of cases involving the United States by chief justice. Fuller’s dominance reflects both his relatively long tenure (of over two decades) and, again, the explosion of federal litigation in the late 19th century. The Warren court comes second with 619 cases, followed by the court of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White (1910-1921) with 526. Among recent chief justices, William Rehnquist (1986-2005) presided over 330 cases while John Roberts has seen 250 such cases through the 2024 term. As noted above, however, the Roberts court’s lower count likely reflects the court’s generally smaller docket rather than any reduced federal government presence.

Support for the United States by chief justice era

The next figure presents support rates for the United States across chief justice eras. The modern pattern shows considerable variation. The courts of White and Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (1864-1873) led with 70.4% and 70% support for the United States, respectively, followed by the court of Chief Justice William Howard Taft (1921-1930), himself a former president, at 66.33%. Fuller, despite deciding the most cases, supported the government at 64.74%. Among more recent courts, that of Warren E. Burger (1969-1986) supported the United States 64.09% of the time, while Rehnquist’s was at 63.01%.

The famously liberal Warren court is notable for its 52.74% support rate – among the lowest of any chief justice era. This makes some sense: this relatively low rate came during a period of significant expansion in individual rights and skepticism toward government power. The Roberts court falls even nearer the bottom, however, at 49.39%.

Finally is the court under Chief Justice John Marshall (1801-1835). Given Marshall was generally considered a proponent of federal power, it is of some surprise that his court shows a historically low 40.74% support rate for the United States. That said, this may reflect the limited scope of federal authority in the early republic and the nascent state of executive power during that era more than anything else.

The partisan dimension

The next chart breaks down support for the United States by chief justice and the party of the appointing president. The analysis is limited to chief justices since 1900 in order to focus on the modern era of more developed executive power.

As the data reveals, when one party held a durable edge in appointments, the court’s support for the United States tended to be higher. For example, in the early 1900s (the Fuller, White, and Taft courts), the bulk of the justices were Republican appointees, reflecting that party’s dominance of the presidency for long stretches around the turn of the century. It’s thus unsurprising that the court frequently voted in favor of the administration during this period. What’s more striking is how high the U.S. win rate was under Democratic administrations even with a Republican-appointed bench, such as in the White court era – an indicator that, during this period, the court’s general receptiveness to federal power often outweighed any simple party alignment.

These percentages decreased during the court of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (1930-1941). This era began with a bench still heavily shaped by earlier Republican administrations, but which rapidly became a Roosevelt-appointed court after the late 1930s (and FDR’s successive terms). By the time of the courts of Chief Justices Harlan Fiske Stone (1941-1946) and Fred M. Vinson (1946-1953), the story is more straightforward: the overwhelming majority of the justices were Democratic appointees (almost all entirely appointed by FDR, in Stone’s case), during Democratic terms.

That brings us to the Warren era. Although the Warren court is remembered as liberal, its roster was mixed – containing many Roosevelt/Truman appointees, but then supplemented by Republican Eisenhower appointees (including Warren himself) alongside later Kennedy/Johnson picks.

For the Burger and Rehnquist courts, the figure shows a clearer correlation between the party of the appointing president and the court’s support for the presidency than is present in the early-mid century: Both eras feature higher pro–U.S. rates under Republican administrations than Democratic ones. That pattern is broadly consistent with the reality that, over the long run of each court, Republican appointees held a durable edge in the voting coalitions that most often formed majorities. But the gap is also modest, especially under Rehnquist, where even a court with a Republican-appointed tilt still delivered substantial executive wins under Democratic presidents.

By the time Roberts became chief, the partisan structure is clearest. The bulk of the court is Republican-appointed and has been so since Roberts’ appointment as chief justice. There, a noticeably higher win rate for the United States under Republican administrations is consistent with the conventional wisdom about a Republican-appointed majority court.

Stepping back, the trend looks like a shift from weak partisan sorting to stronger partisan sorting over time. In the early 1900s and much of the mid-century, appointing-party composition helps explain some variation, but high United States win rates under both parties point to a court whose baseline posture toward federal power often dominated partisan alignment. Over time – especially by the late 20th century and then more sharply in the Roberts era – the relationship between the party of the appointing president and differential success for Republican versus Democratic administrations becomes more pronounced. The most plausible interpretation is that the docket and the parties’ legal agendas became more ideologically sorted: Modern Democratic and Republican administrations more often defend positions that map onto the court’s ideological cleavage, so the appointing-party composition has come to increasingly predict which administration will fare better in contested, high-salience government cases.

Individual justices and the current Roberts court

The voting patterns of current Roberts court justices deserve closer examination given contemporary debates about executive power. The following figure shows the overall top and bottom 15 justices by their support rate for the United States among those with at least 25 votes in such cases.

Among the current justices, none appear in the top 15. At the bottom there is a mix of the court’s conservative and liberal wings. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, often viewed as part of the court’s liberal wing, voted for the government 43.16% of the time. This places her just a touch above fellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan, who voted in favor of the government 42.29% of the time and significantly ahead of Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the more conservative justices, who supported the government’s position less than 37% of the time, perhaps in line with his libertarian instincts. (The average support for the government across all justices with 25 or more votes was 55.82%.)

Further focusing on the current justices we see the following:

With the exception of Gorsuch, the conservative justices, led by Justice Samuel Alito, provide the highest support for the government. Roberts is right in the middle at 51.43%.

Moving to support for Republican versus Democratic administrations, across the Roberts court every justice shown is more likely to vote for the United States when a Republican administration is in office, though the size of that gap varies, as demonstrated by the chart above. The largest partisan swings appear for Kagan (a Democratic appointee with a relatively low pro-United States rate under Democratic administrations but, interestingly, a much higher rate under Republican ones) and Gorsuch (a Republican appointee whose pro-United States rate jumps sharply under Republican administrations). Roberts and Sotomayor also show sizable gaps favoring Republican administrations.

At the same time, the chart underscores that party alignment isn’t a complete explanation. Alito, who is a Republican appointee and considered strongly conservative, is highly pro-United States under both parties, just markedly more so under Republican administrations – consistent with a justice who is broadly receptive to government authority or law enforcement positions but especially aligned with conservative stances. The votes of Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, also all Republican appointees, reflect a baseline willingness to side with the government but less so than Alito. (Jackson, a Democratic appointee, appears only under Democratic administrations here.) While the pattern may fit conventional expectations for a court with a durable Republican-appointed majority in which Republican administrations benefit more often, the magnitude depends on each justice’s jurisprudential commitments and the ideological content of the government’s positions in the cases that actually reach the merits docket.

So what does this tell us?

The data present a more nuanced picture than recent commentary might suggest, and especially those who contend that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power. Indeed, this court’s 49.39% support rate for the United States is below the historical average and substantially lower than the courts led by Fuller, Taft, Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist – that is, all the courts since 1900.

The partisan analysis also reveals some interesting patterns. Republican-appointed courts since 1900 have generally supported the government at higher rates during Republican presidencies, though the Roberts court shows lower overall support rates than its predecessors regardless of which party controls the White House. This could reflect polarization in case selection, with more controversial executive actions reaching the court, or genuine changes in judicial philosophy about executive power.

That said, several important limitations must be acknowledged. First, and perhaps most significantly, this analysis excludes the shadow docket. Emergency applications and stays have become increasingly important in recent years, particularly for cases involving significant issues relating to immigration, pandemic response, and other executive actions. The shadow docket may tell a separate story about deference to executive power, and analyzing it requires accounting for different legal standards and procedural postures.

Second, we have excluded cases involving agency deference where the United States was not directly a party. We have also not examined cases where the president or a cabinet member’s name is in the case caption instead of the United States (such as those over presidential immunity) or where other government officials may be a named party. I plan to do so in a follow-up study.

Third, the analysis does not distinguish between Trump’s two presidencies. During Trump’s first term, the Roberts court decided numerous cases involving his administration. The current term remains in its early stages with limited data. Separating these periods might well reveal different patterns.

Fourth, the analysis treats all cases involving the United States equally, without accounting for issue area, case importance, or the strength of the government’s legal position. Criminal cases, civil litigation, and constitutional challenges might present different voting patterns, and a more granular analysis could reveal that the court is deferential in some domains but not others (and might also help explain why even certain Democratic-appointed justices favor the United States in Republican versus Democratic administrations – something quite notable but beyond the scope of the current article).

Finally, examining whether support is Trump-specific or party-specific requires additional work. The clustering of current justices around similar support rates suggests that partisan differences may be less pronounced than in earlier eras, but this could also reflect the types of cases reaching the court or the strength of legal arguments presented. Additionally, since the sample size for the current court composition is still relatively low, comparisons between this court and previous eras will become clearer as the justices work through more cases.

The bottom line

Despite claims to the contrary, the Roberts court, rather than showing exceptional deference to executive power, actually falls below the historical average in its support for the federal government when it appears as a party on the merits docket.

But perhaps what most emerges from a historical analysis is a complex picture that resists simple narratives. The court’s relationship with executive power varies across eras, reflects changing understandings of federal authority, and appears influenced by both partisan considerations and broader jurisprudential trends. At the very least, this initial analysis provides a foundation for deeper examination of these patterns and their implications for the separation of powers in these politically fraught times.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PXL_20231002_1955025892-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:33.511303

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of ICE detention data made available by the Deportation Data Project through mid-October finds the number and rate of self-deportations among detainees booked into Broadview appears to have soared during the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz.
The analysis focused on detainees who were initially booked into the Broadview facility, which appears by name as “Broadview Service Staging” in the data.
However, a department spokesperson strongly denied that there are “subprime conditions” or barriers to legal counsel for detainees at Broadview.
The analysis indicates recent arrestees who began their ICE detention at Broadview were sent to facilities all over the country, more than 57 facilities in 14 different states.","In just a few months, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in west suburban Broadview has transformed from an immigration holding center that rarely booked more than 10 people a day to a de facto detention center processing dozens of detainees during almost all hours of the day.

People held there have described a litany of inhumane conditions: overcrowded and unsanitary holding cells; not enough food and water; and freezing conditions at night.

They were also signing a form to voluntarily leave the country — to self-deport — at alarmingly high rates, according to a WBEZ and Chicago Sun-Times analysis of recently released federal data. Legal experts said, in many cases, detainees at Broadview were coerced into signing paperwork before even speaking to a lawyer.

“They’re agreeing to voluntary departure, but the voluntary part is not accurate,” said Samuel Cole, chief immigration litigation counsel at ACLU Illinois. “They’re not knowingly and truly voluntarily agreeing to give up the rights to fight their case.”

Cole said some detainees sign the voluntary departure form to escape difficult conditions in Broadview and don’t understand what legal options are available to them.

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of ICE detention data made available by the Deportation Data Project through mid-October finds the number and rate of self-deportations among detainees booked into Broadview appears to have soared during the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz.

From Sept. 8 through Oct. 15, at least 154 people who were initially booked into Broadview have self-deported, more than nearly every other ICE detention facility in the nation during that time.

That’s about 36% of all detainees booked into Broadview during that period who were no longer in ICE detention as of Oct. 15, faster than the 11% self-deportation rate during Trump’s second term before the immigration blitz began and much faster than a rate of 6% during the last year of the Biden administration.

The self-deportation rate among those booked into Broadview during the first five and a half weeks of the Chicago-area immigration enforcement campaign was also faster than it was nationwide. Among all detainees initially booked into any ICE facility from Sep. 8 to Oct. 15, the rate of self-deportations was about 19%, nearly half of what it was for those initially detained at Broadview.

WBEZ and the Sun-Times defined individuals as self-deportees if the data indicated they had left ICE detention, had a date they departed the country and had “3-Voluntary Departure Confirmed” as their case status. The analysis focused on detainees who were initially booked into the Broadview facility, which appears by name as “Broadview Service Staging” in the data.

Questions about DHS provided data

Data released this month was a result of a lawsuit won by the Deportation Data Project and offers the first detailed data about those detained at Broadview during the first five and a half weeks of the feds’ Chicago-area immigration enforcement blitz. ICE collects data on every person it arrests, detains and deports, but the agency stopped regularly publishing metrics in January.

Still, some advocates are also concerned about the accuracy of data published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for ICE.

“Some data on the number of people who were detained in Broadview just doesn’t match, for example, how many sandwiches were ordered,” said Cole with the ACLU. “There are significant differences.”

Why are self-deportations up?

Cole, who served as a federal immigration judge for nearly 10 years before formally stepping down this fall, said the use of voluntary departure has significantly shifted under the Trump administration.

Before, an immigration judge would determine if a person was “removeable,” and then offer the option of voluntary departure. Now, people are getting arrested and almost immediately “coerced” into signing voluntary departure paperwork, Cole said.

People are presented with forms before even talking to a lawyer and often in a language they don’t understand, Cole said. And these could be people who have valid ways to stay in the country but do not know it.

They’re told their options are to sign the papers and leave or wait in detention, potentially for weeks, until a judge can hear their case, according to Cole.

“The end result is people feel that they’re being forced to take voluntary departure without having an ability to talk to a lawyer, without having their case presented to an immigration judge,” Cole said.

By design, the conditions inside Broadview have also forced some to quickly self-deport, according to Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office.

“The administration’s deportation machine was built with cruel intentions and complete disregard of humanity,” said Van Brunt in a written statement to WBEZ and the Sun-Times.

“By subjecting detainees to intolerable conditions and by using tactics of coercion and misrepresentation, people are self-deporting instead of being held in ICE facilities. It’s clear that this administration is more interested in meeting its arbitrary, self-imposed deportation quotas instead of giving detainees an opportunity to make their case in U.S. courts,” wrote Van Brunt.

DHS did not respond to a request to clarify the data. However, a department spokesperson strongly denied that there are “subprime conditions” or barriers to legal counsel for detainees at Broadview.

“All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in an email to WBEZ. “No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees.”

Last week, DHS also announced a $3,000 stipend and a paid one-way plane ticket for people who chose to self-deport through a government app before the end of the year.

“We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right legal way to live American dream. If not, you will be arrested and deported without a chance to return,” McLaughlin wrote.

Detainees held at Broadview increased sharply during the blitz

During the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz, 1,854 people were booked into Broadview, more than almost every other facility in the country. Only hold rooms in Dallas and Montgomery, Ala., took in more detainees during that time.

Broadview was never designed to serve as a detention center. The processing center, which contains four holding rooms, was intended to hold people picked up by immigration authorities for no more than 12 hours.

In late June, ICE quietly expanded the maximum time people could be held in processing centers like Broadview to 72 hours, or three days.

But a Sun-Times and WBEZ investigation found officials were often holding immigrants at Broadview beyond the 72-hour mark.

The MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Trump administration in October, alleging Broadview was a “black box in which to disappear people from the U.S. justice and immigration systems.”

Former detainees testified that 100 people were crammed into a holding room at one time. They also said they were given no hot meals or places to sleep. One former detainee broke down explaining how he’d have to wake people up to go to the bathroom at night because they were sleeping beside the toilet.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman issued a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to provide people bedding, “sufficient space to sleep,” adequate hygiene supplies and three full meals with water. Gettleman also ordered ICE to ensure detainees had access to lawyers and a phone.

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis shows the number of people held at Broadview at 5 a.m. each day, based on detainee book-in and book-out times, increased sharply after Operation Midway Blitz began in September, and exceeded 100 people on more than a dozen days.

Under the Biden administration, people detained at Broadview were typically sent to detention facilities in the Midwest. In 2024, the last full calendar year of the Biden administration, more than 90% of people detained at Broadview were sent to the Clay County Justice Center in Brazil, Ind., or the Dodge County Jail in Juneau, Wis., according to a WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project.

In a written statement to WBEZ and the Sun-Times, a DHS spokesperson said the agency makes facility determinations based on bed space to ensure detainees’ “presence for immigration proceedings or removal from the United States.”

But the facilities to which detainees are sent often are far from where they were arrested and many are likely outside of the court jurisdiction where their cases are being heard, advocates said. The analysis indicates recent arrestees who began their ICE detention at Broadview were sent to facilities all over the country, more than 57 facilities in 14 different states. “[It’s] undoubtedly because of how many people are detained right now,” Cole said. “They’re constantly battling crowding at facilities, and they’re moving people around because of it.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c37b82b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7716x4405+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2Fd4%2F17fad7f340f5b78e207651c24a18%2Fbroadviewcurfew-111425-01.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:38.481381

Similarly, the author writes, today has seen the rise of mutual aid and activism, including whistleblowing, filming enforcement actions and sustained support for families affected by immigration enforcement, offering a counterweight amid ongoing humanitarian concerns.","CHICAGO — An opinion piece published on SCOTUSblog on Dec. 23, 2025, sheds light on the constitutional and human consequences of contemporary immigration enforcement operating under the Trump administration, drawing connections to historical cases such as the Supreme Court’s 1842 decision in Prigg v. Pennsylvania.

The article, “The worst Supreme Court case you’ve never heard of, and what it tells us about Trump’s immigration enforcement,” recounts the 1837 case of Edward Prigg and other slave catchers who, under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, kidnapped Margaret Morgan, a free Black woman, and her children from Pennsylvania and took them to Maryland.

In the years that followed, Pennsylvania enacted a “personal liberty law” requiring slave catchers to appear before a state magistrate before removing alleged fugitives from the state. Under this law, Prigg initially brought the Morgan family before a magistrate but was denied authorization to remove them because Jerry Morgan was “clearly free,” while Margaret’s legal status was disputed.

Pennsylvania later prosecuted Prigg after he returned while Jerry was away, abducted Margaret and the children, and transported them to Maryland without authorization. Despite the prosecution, the Supreme Court struck down the statute. Justice Joseph Story, writing for the court, ruled that states could not impose restrictions on slaveholders reclaiming enslaved people under the Constitution’s fugitive slave clause, except to prevent a “breach of the peace or any illegal violence.”

The SCOTUSblog article emphasizes how this ruling left Black people in free states unprotected from abduction, violence and other humanitarian harms, including those who were legally free. The author writes, “We don’t know what happened to Margaret and her children,” adding that Jerry Morgan never learned their fate despite desperately trying to find them. This decision, which stripped states of the power to protect their residents, is presented as a parallel to present-day immigration enforcement.

The article cites reports of families separated during immigration actions, noting that the author “cannot look at that picture without thinking of Jerry Morgan,” referring to an image of a man crying outside a Chicago-area ICE facility after his wife was taken. One need not equate immigration enforcement with slavery, she writes, “to recognize the inhumanity of what is occurring.”

Approximately 6 million children — about 82% of whom are U.S. citizens — have at least one parent who is undocumented, with more than 14 million U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents also living with an undocumented immigrant. These figures support the article’s reference to reports that the Trump administration set a quota of 3,000 detentions per day.

With people being “seized by armed and masked men” and denied the chance to establish their legal status, contact loved ones or say goodbye, the article critiques the reasoning and implementation of the civil laws the administration uses as a framework. The author argues this approach “devastates families, communities, and businesses, and spreads massive fear.”

The piece also notes that President Donald Trump ordered agents to focus on Somali communities in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and describes Somali immigrants as “garbage.” This language raises concerns about racial profiling in immigration enforcement, with the article pointing out that federal agents have relied on factors such as apparent Hispanic ethnicity, speaking Spanish, location and type of work to establish “reasonable suspicion” of unlawful presence.

According to the article, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has endorsed this reasoning by writing that U.S. citizens and lawfully present noncitizens would be only “briefly detained” long enough to establish their status, citing Noem v. Perdomo Vasquez. In contrast, the article notes that U.S. citizens in ICE custody have been held “sometimes for extended periods and sometimes repeatedly,” with agents refusing to accept proof of citizenship or lawful status.

The article also cites findings by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis in her examination of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, which documented immigration agents firing pepper balls at unarmed protesters and journalists, deploying tear gas into crowds and vehicles without warning, and physically assaulting observers and demonstrators. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit later stayed Ellis’ injunction, the author notes, though “not because they doubted her factfinding.”

These incidents, along with the shooting of two individuals in Chicago, one of whom died, underscore the extent to which the author argues federal agents are exercising power beyond their roles. The article further cites an instance of law enforcement rappelling into an apartment building at night and removing residents without warrants.

Detainees have reported being held in “filthy and overcrowded spaces” without adequate medical care, bedding, food or access to lavatories. The article states that detainees are sometimes pressured, under threat or physical force, to sign “voluntary” deportation papers without lawyers and that many are unable to read the documents, which are often only in English.

Critiquing the immigration court system and its placement within the Department of Justice, the opinion piece describes the situation as one where “the boss of the prosecutor” is also “the boss of the judge.” Several immigration judges have been fired under the administration, the author writes, despite a backlog of roughly 3.8 million cases.

Those judges include individuals who grant asylum at higher-than-average rates, a context the article says makes Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s posting for a “Deportation Judge” particularly troubling. The SCOTUSblog piece emphasizes that “there is in fact no such job” in federal law.

In concluding, the author reflects on historical and contemporary forms of resistance. In the 19th century, slave-catcher watches and community rescues helped advance protective efforts even when courts struck down laws. Such actions, described as “acts not only of protest and solidarity, but also of constitutional vision and commitment,” are framed as part of a tradition that eventually led to the Reconstruction Amendments.

Similarly, the author writes, today has seen the rise of mutual aid and activism, including whistleblowing, filming enforcement actions and sustained support for families affected by immigration enforcement, offering a counterweight amid ongoing humanitarian concerns.

That took place after the department changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, removing the need for immigration law experience.","More than a quarter of federal immigration judges in California have been fired, retired or quit since the start of the Trump administration.

The reduction follows a trend in immigration courts nationwide and constitutes, critics say, an attack on the rule of law that will lead to yet more delays in an overburdened court system.

The reduction in immigration judges has come as the administration scaled up efforts to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Trump administration officials have described the immigration court process, in which proceedings can take years amid a backlog of millions of cases, as an impediment to their goals.

Nationwide, there were 735 immigration judges last fiscal year, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. At least 97 have been fired since President Trump took office and about the same number have resigned or retired, according to the union representing immigration judges.

California has lost at least 35 immigration judges since January, according to Mobile Pathways, a Berkeley-based organization that analyzes immigration court data. That’s down from 132. The steepest drop occurred at the San Francisco Immigration Court, which has lost more than half its bench.

“A noncitizen might win their case, might lose their case, but the key question is, did they receive a hearing?” said Emmett Soper, who worked at the Justice Department before becoming an immigration judge in Virginia in 2017. “Up until this administration, I had always been confident that I was working in a system that, despite its flaws, was fundamentally fair.”

The administration intends to fill some judge positions, and in new immigration judge job listings in Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere seeks candidates who want to be a “deportation judge” and “restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

The immigration judges union called the job listings “insulting.”

Trump wrote on Truth Social in April that he was elected to “remove criminals from our Country, but the Courts don’t seem to want me to do that.”

“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,” he added.

The National Assn. of Immigration Judges said it expects a wave of additional retirements at the end of this month.

“My biggest concern is for the people whose lives are left in limbo. What can they count on when the ground is literally shifting every moment that they’re here?” said Amber George, who was fired last month from the San Francisco Immigration Court. “Our government institutions are losing their legitimacy.”

Because immigration courts operate under the Justice Department, their priorities typically shift from one presidential administration to the next, but the extreme changes taking place have renewed longtime calls for immigration courts to become independent of the executive branch.

The Trump administration recently added 36 judges; 25 of them are military lawyers serving in temporary positions.

This summer, the Pentagon authorized up to 600 military lawyers to work for the Department of Justice. That took place after the department changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, removing the need for immigration law experience.

The Department of Justice did not respond to specific questions, but said judges must be impartial and that the agency is obligated to take action against those who demonstrate systemic bias.

Former judges say that, because terminations have happened with no advance notice, remaining court staff have often scrambled to get up to speed on reassigned cases.

Ousted judges described a pattern: In the afternoon, sometimes while presiding over a hearing, they receive a short email stating that they are being terminated pursuant to Article II of the Constitution. Their names are swiftly removed from the Justice Department website.

Jeremiah Johnson is one of five judges terminated recently from the San Francisco Immigration Court.

Johnson said he worries the Trump administration is circumventing immigration courts by making conditions so unbearable that immigrants decide to drop their cases.

The number of detained immigrants has climbed to record levels since January, with more than 65,000 in custody. Immigrants and lawyers say the conditions are inhumane, alleging medical neglect, punitive solitary confinement and obstructed access to legal counsel. Requests by immigrants for voluntary departure, which avoids formal deportation, have surged in recent months.

Many of those arrests have happened at courthouses, causing immigrants to avoid their legal claims out of fear of being detained and forcing judges to order them removed in absentia.

“Those are ways to get people to leave the United States without seeing a judge, without due process that Congress has provided,” Johnson said. “It’s a dismantling of the court system.”

The judges in San Francisco’s Immigration Court have historically had higher asylum approval rates than the national average. Johnson said grant rates depend on a variety of circumstances, including whether a person is detained or has legal representation, their country of origin and whether they are adults or children.

In November, the military judges serving in immigration courts heard 286 cases and issued rulings in 110, according to Mobile Pathways. The military judges issued deportation orders in 78% of the cases — more often than other immigration judges that month, who ordered deportations in 63% of cases.

“They’re probably following directions — and the military is very good at following directions — and it’s clear what their directions are that are given by this administration,” said Mobile Pathways co-founder Bartlomiej Skorupa. He cautioned that 110 cases are a small sample size and that trends will become clearer in the coming months.

Former immigration judges and their advocates say that appointing people with no immigration experience and little training makes for a steep learning curve and the possibility of due process violations.

“There are multiple concerns here: that they’re temporary, which could expose them to greater pressure to decide cases in a certain way; and also they lack experience in immigration law, which is an extremely complex area of practice,” said Ingrid Eagly, an immigration law professor at UCLA.

Immigration courts have a backlog of more than 3 million cases. Anam Petit, who served as an immigration judge in Virginia until September, said the administration’s emphasis on speedy case completions has to be balanced against the constitutional right to a fair hearing.

“There are not enough judges to hear those cases, and this administration [is] taking it upon themselves to fire a lot of experienced and trained judges who can hear those cases and can mitigate that backlog,” she said.

Complementary bills introduced in the U.S. Senate and House this month by Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) would prevent the appointment of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges and impose a two-year limit of service.

“The Trump administration’s willingness to fire experienced immigration judges and hire inexperienced or temporary ‘deportation judges,’ especially in places like California, has fundamentally impacted the landscape of our justice system,” Schiff said in a statement announcing the bill.

The bills have little chance in the Republican-controlled Congress but illustrate how significantly Democrats — especially in California — oppose the administration’s changes to immigration courts.

Former Immigration Judge Tania Nemer, a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S., sued the Justice Department and Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi this month, alleging that she was illegally terminated in February because of her gender, ethnic background and political affiliation. In 2023, Nemer ran for judicial office in Ohio as a Democrat.

Bondi addressed the lawsuit in a Cabinet meeting.

“Most recently, yesterday, I was sued by an immigration judge who we fired,” she said Dec. 2. “One of the reasons she said she was a woman. Last I checked, I was a woman as well.”

Other former judges have challenged their terminations through the federal Merit Systems Protection Board.

Johnson, of San Francisco, is one of those. He filed his appeal this month, claiming that he was not given cause for termination.

“My goal is to be reinstated,” he said. “My colleagues on the bench, our court was vibrant. It was a good place to work, despite all the pressures.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4474f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6051x3177+0+430/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F28%2F87bc0f50449f9db96dc4ba93022b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2219062487,N,,2025-12-29 08:56:46.982499

Federal immigration officers have detained thousands of people in Massachusetts this year, part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policies. About 70% of the immigrants detained nationwide between January and October had no criminal record, according to government data. While some people have been deported and some remain in custody across the country, others have been released, seen their cases dropped, or are out on bond while they await future court hearings. Today we have four stories from people detained locally and released back to their New England communities, as reported by GBH News’ Sarah Betancourt, who has been following these cases all year.

After detention: What life’s been like for four immigrants in New England

GBH News reporter Sarah Betancourt has been following the cases of immigrants detained in Massachusetts this year. Here are the stories of four people detained and released, and how they’re doing now.

Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student detained on the street outside her apartment in Somerville and kept in federal custody for 45 days — sometimes without access to her asthma medication — is now working on her Ph.D. dissertation, her attorney said. “Really, it’s an example of how she is really dedicated to her Ph.D. related to child study and human development,” her attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said on GBH’s Boston Public Radio. Öztürk still has ongoing legal cases: an immigration court case through which the U.S. government attempted to deport her and a case in federal court in which she challenged her detention.

Khanbabai noted that Öztürk’s case shows the vast power the U.S. government has over immigrants: the Trump administration revoked Öztürk’s student visa without her knowledge and detained her after she co-wrote an op-ed for the Tufts student paper about Israel’s war in Gaza. “Essentially it means Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio can say, ‘I don’t like that person for whatever reason. And I’m going to revoke their visa,’” Khanbabai said.

Marcelo Gomes da Silva, the Milford High School student detained while driving to volleyball practice over the summer, said he’s focusing on his senior year of high school and thinking about college. “In the beginning it was obviously hard because my parents were super nervous. They were really scared,” Gomes da Silva told Betancourt. “But after time it slowly started getting better because we were able to do things that have to do with our documentation, like apply for asylum and things like that. So slowly things have been getting better.”

He said his memories of the ICE detention center in Burlington, where he slept on concrete in one room with 35 other men and did not have access to hygiene supplies, “will never go away.” He’s been advocating for other immigrants in detention. “I wanna go to college for political science and hopefully go to law school. I’m really interested in being a politician and I feel like if I educate myself more and more, I will be able to help others around me,” he said.

Lucas Dos Santos Amaral has welcomed a son, Theo, since his release from ICE custody. He’s also been singing gospel in churches across New England and has a valid work permit. His next court hearing is two years away, in the winter of 2027. “We are ending another year united and stronger, because I believe that this battle I faced will serve the benefit of all of us immigrants,” Dos Santos Amaral said in a message to Betancourt. “Our Christmas will have a taste of victory and gratitude.”

The ICE agents who pulled him over in January were looking for a different person, and local elected officials at the time said it appeared they pulled over Dos Santos Amaral because they had racially profiled him. He was taken to ICE detention in Plymouth, then moved to Texas. After a judge ordered him released, ICE let him out without his identification, so friends flew to Texas to bring him documents so he could travel back to his family — his pregnant wife and their first daughter — in Massachusetts.

“My life has never been the same — those were frightening and traumatic days, hope was scarce, but my faith in God never wavered,” he said.

Fabian Schmidt, a New Hampshire resident and Green Card holder, was detained at Logan airport in March, where he says he was violently interrogated and denied the ability to contact his family, an attorney, or the embassy for his home country, Germany. Federal authorities kept him in custody for two months, then dropped his case and released him.

The weekend of his release, Schmidt proposed to his partner. They’ve since gotten married and Schmidt returned to work. “I love this country so much. My daughter, my wife, my whole life is here,” he told Betancourt. “So I’m trying to become an American as soon as possible. And if there was some kind of magic trick to make that happen now, I would totally sign my paperwork.”

He said he feels the trauma of the experience. He’s developed stomach ulcers because of the stress.

“Honestly, I don’t think that’s gonna fade for quite a while. I think about it every day. Every day, I think about my own pain — It still makes an impact on me for sure,” he said.

The judge says Carlitos Ricardo Parias, who goes by Richard LA online, was denied access to his lawyers while being held in detention.

He also cites the government's failure to meet discovery deadlines, including the timely release of body camera footage of the shooting.

ORIGINAL REPORT: TikToker shot by federal agents, deputy US marshal hit by ricochet bullet during South LA operation

The shooting happened in the 400 block of East 20th Street near Trinity Street around 8:52 a.m. Federal officials said it began as a targeted enforcement traffic stop on an undocumented immigrant who had previously avoided capture.

Agents accused Parias of ramming his car into their vehicles after they boxed him in, but video from the scene raises questions about their claims.

In a statement back in October, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said Parias ""weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots.""

Parias was accused of ramming his Toyota Camry into law enforcement vehicles in front of and behind him after they boxed him in.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.
DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.","Since Inauguration Day, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive revocation of legal immigration.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://ottumwaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/johann-teran.avif,N,,2025-12-29 09:58:33.072847

In a Saturday order, U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin cited the deprivation of Carlitos Ricardo Parias’ access to counsel while held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention and the government’s failure to comply with discovery deadlines — including the timely release of body worn camera footage that captured the shooting.

Federal authorities had accused Parias, a well-known TikTok streamer of local breaking news, of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in and tried to arrest him during an immigration enforcement operation in South L.A. in October. An ICE officer opened fire, striking Parias in the arm and injuring a deputy U.S. marshal with a ricochet bullet.

That same day, prosecutors charged Parias with assault on a federal officer. In November, he was indicted by a grand jury. Parias was scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, previously told the Times that Parias had “weaponized his vehicle” and said “fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots.” But newly obtained body worn camera footage raises questions about that claim.

The video captures an ICE officer holding a gun in one hand and using the other to break open the window of Parias’ car. As the officer shouts at Parias to turn off the car, Parias raises his hands in the air and asks why he is being detained. The officer repeatedly tries to open the passenger side door, before moving the gun to his left hand, right before firing.

At the time, Parias’ car did not appear to be moving.

“Oh,” the officer said, sounding surprised. “F—.”

“Who shot?” someone asked.

“I shot, I shot,” the officer responded.

In his 28-page order, Olguin dismissed the indictment with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot refile the same charges of assault on a federal officer using a deadly or dangerous weapon and depredation of government property.

“In short, because the deprivation of Mr. Parias’s access to counsel during the critical period prior to his trial caused him actual and threatened prejudice, and because no other remedy could adequately cure his deprivation, the court agrees with defendant that dismissal of the indictment is warranted,” Olguin wrote.

A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Federal Public Defender Cuauhtemoc Ortega and Deputy Federal Public Defender Gabriela Rivera, who represented Parias, said in a statement that they were “pleased that the court dismissed the charges against their client.”

“While we remain quite confident that a jury would readily acquit Mr. Parias, the government prejudiced his right to a fair and speedy trial by denying him meaningful access to his defense team and failing to timely disclose the evidence they claimed supported the charges,” they said in the statement. “We are grateful that Mr. Parias’s constitutional rights were vindicated.”

Although the criminal charges against him have been dismissed, Parias could remain in ICE detention as his immigration case proceeds.

Federal authorities sought to arrest Parias on Oct. 21 on an administrative arrest warrant in conjunction with a federal immigration proceeding, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. Homeland Security officials have said Parias is in the country illegally.

An official with the Department of Homeland Security accused Parias of having “previously escaped from custody,” although video obtained by the Times appears to show the federal agents letting him go during a June incident.

In the recent incident that ended with a shooting, Parias was leaving his home and driving down the street, when federal agents — including from ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service — used their vehicles to box him in, according to the criminal complaint.

Body worn camera footage captures the ICE officer approaching Parias’ passenger side door and stating that he’s going to “break the window.” As the officer smashes the window, the car begins to rev and smoke billows up from the spinning tires. The officer pulls out his gun soon after, holding it in his right hand as he smashes the window at the same time.

The complaint alleges that when the rear of the car began to “fishtail,” it “caused the agents to fear that PARIAS may lose control of the Camry and hit them.” A Homeland Security Investigations agent wrote that Parias’ acceleration of the Camry “caused debris (likely rubber being shed from the tires themselves) to fly into the air, which struck some of the agents.”

“Bajate, te vamos a disparar,” the ICE officer warns in the video. “Get out, we’re going to shoot you.”

Once the wheels stopped spinning, an officer reached in through the broken window of the passenger door, “brandishing a gun in one hand while attempting to open the door with the other,” the judge wrote in his order.

As the officer shouts at him to turn off the car, Parias says in the body cam footage that he doesn’t have anything and asks why he’s being detained. An agent appears to say that if Parias moves, they’ll shoot.

“Mátenme, mátenme,” Parias says. “Kill me.”

In the video, the ICE officer can be seen firing shortly after and Parias begins to scream: “Mi mano.” My hand.

Shortly after the shooting, the officer opens up his phone and sends a message. The content of the message is not visible in the footage.

Parias was hospitalized for nearly a week after the shooting, before being transported to jail.

Although a federal judge later ordered Parias released on bond, once he was released from the custody of the U.S. Marshals, he was immediately transferred to ICE custody on Nov. 24, pursuant to a detainer. He’s being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.

Olguin wrote in his order that “the government’s decision to administratively detain Mr. Parias in Adelanto is when and where the constitutional violations began in this case.”

By placing Parias in immigration detention, Olguin wrote, the government “has jeopardized this court’s ability to try Mr. Parias in compliance with the demands of the Sixth Amendment” — which provides for a fair and speedy trial.

Parias’ attorneys filed a declaration citing challenges to Parias’ access to counsel resulting from his detention in Adelanto, which is at least a two hour drive from the defense counsel’s office in downtown L.A.

With less than three weeks before trial, Parias’ defense team had been unable to schedule any legal visits with Parias since the beginning of his ICE detention, Ortega said in a court filing. He cited the distance and difficulties scheduling a video-telephone conference with their client.

“Here, defendant’s detention in Adelanto has effectively denied him access to his counsel for nearly the entire month preceding trial,” Olguin wrote in his order. “In short, the obstacles and roadblocks that ICE has put in place at Adelanto make it difficult, if not impossible, for defendant to meet with his attorneys, and have caused defendant to suffer demonstrable prejudice or a substantial threat thereof.”

Olguin also noted that the government did not produce any discovery to the defense until Nov. 26, nearly a month after the initial request. He said the government “has continued to produce discovery to the defense well beyond the discovery cutoff.”

Here are the top immigration storylines from 2025:

February: A sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill becomes law

Gov. Ron DeSantis in February signed a comprehensive anti-illegal immigration package into law just hours after GOP lawmakers muscled it through the Legislature.

The law, SB-4C, created state-level penalties for entering Florida without proper documents, mandated the death penalty for a non-citizen convicted of a capital crime, nixed in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and demanded that all counties partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

DeSantis signs immigration bills less than an hour after lawmakers passed them

Despite the Legislature’s Republican supermajority, and repeated insistence that all GOP members wanted to carry out newly inaugurated President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, the legislation didn’t have an easy road.

The 2025 session under the leadership of Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Danny Perez, both Republicans, was marked by rare strife between legislative Republicans and the governor, who’d enjoyed vast power over the lawmaking branch throughout his time in office.

But, as DeSantis came off a brutal loss to Trump in Iowa and entered his final years as governor, Florida Republicans began to stray. This was illustrated first when Albritton and Perez unceremoniously adjourned the special session DeSantis called to debate immigration just 15 minutes after it began — killing all of his proposed legislation.

Then, during a second special session, they passed an anti-illegal immigration package called the TRUMP Act. This drew DeSantis’ ire in part because it handed chief immigration authority to the agriculture commissioner, prompting the governor to veto it and call a third special session.

This time, having integrated both the TRUMP Act and DeSantis’ original asks, the governor signed SB-4C into law just hours after it passed both chambers.

April: A U.S. citizen is arrested

Even after his mother begged while a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court, 20-year-old U.S. citizen Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was held for more than 24 hours in Leon County Jail under charges of illegally entering Florida.

Lopez-Gomez, who was born in Grady County, Georgia, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in April during a traffic stop for allegedly being a non-citizen who crossed the state border.

U.S.-born man held for ICE under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

This was false.

Although a Leon County judge examined the birth certificate and declared that she found no probable cause for the charge, made possible by SB-4C passed two months earlier, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because ICE had formally asked the jail to hold him.

ICE is the federal agency in charge of immigration within the United States. Immigration is a federal power, although state and local authorities may assist in detention efforts.

Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in a car pulled over by Florida Highway Patrol for going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone. He was on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.

The provision he was charged under — illegally entering Florida — has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.

June: A federal judge holds James Uthmeier in contempt

For the first time in recent history, a federal judge in June found Florida’s attorney general in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the new state immigration law as illegitimate and unlawful.

Instead of footing James Uthmeier with fines or jail time, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state’s chief legal officer to submit biweekly reports on how many people were being arrested under the immigration law she’d blocked in April. Williams believed it should be zero.

Uthmeier had taken a slightly different view.

Federal judge holds AG James Uthmeier in contempt of court

Days after her initial ruling blocking police and prosecutors from arresting or charging undocumented immigrants for illegally entering the state, Uthmeier mailed letters to law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs. He wrote that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under SB 4C for illegal entry to the state.

Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.

Still, law enforcement carried out arrests after Williams barred them from doing so. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen from Georgia, garnered international attention after it was first reported by the Florida Phoenix.

An investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that police, mostly other troopers, arrested 25 people on April 4, but didn’t find evidence of arrests after April 18. The second date is important because that is when Williams issued a second order clarifying that her suspension of the law applied to cops, which the state argued against, claiming that Uthmeier lacked authority to stop the arrests.

Uthmeier has since appealed the contempt ruling.

July: ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

President Donald Trump made a rare appearance alongside DeSantis and a host of Republican leaders in July to celebrate the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz,” Florida’s sprawling new migrant detention facility in the heart of the Everglades.

Built atop the near-defunct Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, with its 10,000-foot runway and remote location, “Alligator Alcatraz” became the nation’s first state-run detention center.

Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

The federal government will reimburse up to $608 million of costs to construct and maintain the center and its up to 3,000 detainees.

The center quickly drew concerns from environmental activists, human rights groups, and Democrats, worrying that the facility harmed the surrounding fragile ecosystem, provided poor health care, and was operated largely in secrecy.

The Everglades center inspired other state-run centers to crop up nationwide, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer,” Nebraska’s “Cornhusker Clink,” and Louisiana’s “Louisiana Lockup.”

Later, Florida opened the “Deportation Depot” in Baker County and announced plans for a “Panhandle Pokey.”

October: DeSantis asks to “pull the plug” on H-1B visas

DeSantis in October directed Florida’s top higher education board to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers on H-1B visas.

He wanted the Board of Governors to fully “pull the plug” on these visas, which allow foreigners in specialty occupations to temporarily work in the United States.

DeSantis orders Board of Governors to ‘pull the plug’ on H-1B visas in universities

This came a month after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for future H-1B visa applications and amid his administration’s broader efforts to stop illegal immigration and roadblock non-Americans from working in the United States. It signaled Republicans’ push to not only crack down on illegal immigration, but to also stop certain legal immigration avenues.

As of June 30, more than 1,900 Florida employers sponsored more than 7,200 H-1B visa-holders, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There were a total of 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries in the education sphere, with the University of Florida with the most H-1B beneficiaries at 156, followed by the University of Miami with 90 and the University of South Florida with 72.

H1-B visas have become a flashpoint in Republican circles, as party leaders like Trump and DeSantis urge less reliance on foreign labor while others insist that businesses need workers.

November: The visa for extraordinary talent is used by influencers and OnlyFans

The highly exclusive O-1B visa, reserved for foreigners with “extraordinary” artistic talents, has begun to be used by social media influencers, content creators, and even OnlyFans models.

OnlyFans is a pornographic website allowing users to directly engage, pay for, and request photos or videos of sex workers.

In 2018, immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick noticed that a massive influx of overseas social media influencers were trying to obtain these visas. But it wouldn’t be until 2020 that the San Diego attorney was contacted by an OnlyFans model.

The O1 visa is for ‘extraordinary’ talent: Among its users? Influencers and OnlyFans models

At first, he was skeptical.

Then he saw her monthly salary.

“She said, ‘Let me show you the backend of my platform.’ I looked, and she was making $250,000 a month,” Sapochnick told the Florida Phoenix in a zoom interview.

“I was like, oh my god. Okay. I can use that.”

She became Sapochnick’s first OnlyFans client to obtain the O-1B visa. In the next two years, Sapochnick represented influencers from places like China, Russia, and Canada — many of whom were fitness influencers “dabbling” in OnlyFans.

Sapochnick’s story isn’t unique — at least, not anymore. According to five other immigration lawyers across the country who spoke with the Phoenix, the immigration sphere began to slowly shift toward the digital world a decade ago before exploding amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

December: Human rights group alleges torture at Alligator Alcatraz, Krome

Two Florida migrant detention centers may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees, a human rights organization claimed in a December report.

Amnesty International, which operates in 150 countries, alleged in a 48-page report that the federal Krome North Services Processing Center in Miami and — to a greater degree — the state-run Everglades site the DeSantis administration calls “Alligator Alcatraz” have engaged in practices that could violate international law.

‘Copy of Guantánamo’: Human rights group alleges torture, inhumanity at ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ Krome

Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of extended solitary confinement at Krome, a 2-by-2-foot punishment “box” — compared to a lion’s cage at a circus — complete with shackles in the Everglades, and poor medical conditions at both South Florida centers.

One detainee claimed there was a death at the Everglades site, although it “went unreported” because “there’s no way to know what actually happened to the person because we’re not registered in ICE’s system,” AI said.

The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security deny wrongdoing and the existence of any non-compliant standards at the facilities. They insisted the report was a “fabrication” or a “hoax” that could rile up anti-ICE sentiment.

Refugee streams, in this framework, are not incidental outcomes of conflict but durable instruments embedded in it.
Weaponised refugee streams function as a standing system: one that does not require activation to retain effect.
[25] Refugee streams cross borders carrying obligations that liberal democracies cannot refuse without violating their own identity.
[26] Once refugee movement is weaponised, it ceases to be a humanitarian by-product and becomes a managed resource.","Human suffering scales efficiently when it is managed.

The weaponisation of refugees is a low-cost, high-leverage instrument for states able to tolerate ambiguity and export instability. Public vocabulary treats refugees as a humanitarian outcome. In practice, they are an operational resource. In modern conflict, displacement is not incidental; it is functional. When refugee movement is controlled and timed, it becomes a pressure vector that Western systems cannot neutralise without harming themselves. Not metaphorically. Not rhetorically. Practically. [1]

Refugees are increasingly easy to weaponise, to great effect and at a low cost. This is not because the refugees themselves are distressed assets, but because the systems that are targeted by those that wield refugees as weapons are constrained. The modern liberal democracy has a firm set of legal obligations, moral self-image, media exposure, and electoral sensitivity to ensure that the cost of displacement is absorbed internally by the receiving state. A good crisis should never be wasted. It is useful. If none exists, one can be produced. [2][3]

This logic depends on unresolved conflict. Frozen conflicts are particularly suited to it, preserving leverage while avoiding the obligation to decide. When a conflict does not conclude, refugee streams do not disappear. They are held in suspension. People remain abroad on temporary permits. Others live near ceasefire lines without security, property rights, or legal clarity. Return is discussed, but deferred. Integration is partial by design. Over time, this produces populations that can be mobilised again quickly and in large numbers, without coordination. The conflict itself does not need to resume. The pressure is already stored. [4][5]

This dynamic is particularly well understood in Moscow. Russian strategy has long favoured frozen conflicts precisely because they preserve leverage without incurring the cost of resolution. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, Donbas, and Nagorno-Karabakh all functioned not merely as territorial disputes, but as reservoirs of instability, including controlled refugee and displacement flows that could be activated, redirected, or merely implied as circumstances required. Refugee streams, in this framework, are not incidental outcomes of conflict but durable instruments embedded in it.

Viktor Orbán required that his ally, the Slovak populist Robert Fico, secure victory. The objective was straightforward and time-bound. Orbán therefore selected one of the most cost-efficient instruments available in his hybrid activities toolbox: the deliberate creation of controlled refugee streams directed toward the Hungarian–Slovak border in the weeks preceding the vote. [6][7]

Hungary occupies a critical transit position on the Western Balkan route. Control over that position does not require constant enforcement. It requires discretion over when enforcement is applied and when it is relaxed. In early 2023, the Hungarian government released more than 1,500 convicted people-smugglers from Hungarian prisons, citing cost and overcrowding. Most were foreign nationals. They were instructed to leave Hungary within seventy-two hours. No credible mechanism ensured that they did. Trafficking capacity was returned to circulation at scale. [8][9]

At the same time, Hungarian authorities increasingly opted to issue temporary documentation to migrants rather than detain or return them. Enforcement remained rhetorically strict and operationally uneven. Movement followed deliberately relaxed enforcement, as it reliably does. [10]

Relocation required neither coercion nor formal instruction. It required permissiveness, direction, and the provision of false hope. False hope is useful, and eases logistics.

In the months preceding Slovakia’s election on 30 September 2023, migrant presence became increasingly visible in southern Slovak border communities. Groups appeared with regularity. The visibility was new. The timing was precise. Slovak authorities later recorded the scale: more than 27,000 irregular migrants detained in 2023, a ninefold increase from the previous year. The majority were young men travelling north along the Balkan route, transiting Serbia through Hungary and into Slovakia. [11][12]

Migration had already been identified as a decisive political issue. Robert Fico’s SMER-SSD party campaigned explicitly on restoring order and opposing immigration, framing the sitting government as incapable of border control. The sudden, localised visibility of migrants supplied confirmation rather than argument. The crisis did not need exaggeration. It merely needed to exist. [13]

The physical movement was reinforced with an information operation. During late summer 2023, Hungary’s Prime Minister’s Office placed approximately 1.6–1.8 million anti-migration video advertisements into Slovakia via YouTube, a country of 5.5 million inhabitants. The ads depicted migrants breaching fences and Hungarian forces “defending Europe”. Formally categorised as non-political issue messaging, they reached Slovak audiences at scale while refugee streams were being created on the ground. [14][15]

Slovak officials recognised the sequence. Former defence minister Jaroslav Naď publicly stated that Hungary had interfered in Slovakia’s electoral process by deliberately elevating migration as a political issue. Others reached the same conclusion privately. No documentation was required. The sequence was sufficient. [16]

The election produced the intended result. Fico formed a government. Within days, police and military units were deployed to the Hungarian border and routine Schengen procedures were suspended. Within weeks, the situation was declared resolved. Migrant visibility diminished accordingly. Hungary simultaneously tightened its own enforcement once the political objective had been achieved. The controlled refugee streams were throttled. The operation concluded without residue. [17]

Viktor Orbán did not invent this method, but he applied it with discipline.

The receiving state absorbed the cost: public anxiety, municipal strain, media saturation, and electoral pressure. Hungary absorbed none of it, while continuing to present itself as Europe’s defender. The intervention required no secrecy, no escalation, and no formal coordination. It relied on timing, permissiveness, and a neighbouring system structurally incapable of externalising humanitarian pressure. [18]

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan operates the same instrument at continental scale, with an added refinement: availability on demand. [19]

Turkey hosts several million refugees, primarily from Syria. This alone does not constitute leverage. The leverage lies in Ankara’s ability to weaponise refugee streams on demand by controlling onward movement and signalling when that control may be withdrawn. Erdoğan does not need to relocate refugees. He needs only to regulate permeability, and to make credible that such regulation can cease at will. [20][21]

This has been demonstrated repeatedly. At moments of political friction with the European Union, Ankara has allowed refugee movement toward Greece to accelerate, slowed it when concessions were secured, and threatened its release when negotiations stalled. Sometimes movement followed. Sometimes it did not. The outcome was largely the same. European governments adjusted funding, softened criticism, and recalibrated policy to reduce domestic exposure. [22][23]

The pressure was never framed as coercion. No ultimatums were issued. No formal demands were tabled. Instead, it was presented in humanitarian terms: capacity limits, fatigue, financial burden. Turkey did not describe refugee streams as a political choice. It described them as inevitability. The streams themselves performed the argument, while European political systems processed the consequences internally. [24]

From Ankara’s perspective, this is a near-ideal instrument. It is controllable, reversible, and deployable on demand. No treaty is formally violated. No military threshold is crossed. Yet policy shifts repeatedly in Turkey’s favour. The key point is not the absence of coercion, but the absence of any need for it. Weaponised refugee streams function as a standing system: one that does not require activation to retain effect. The credible availability of movement is sufficient to shape policy inside European states without Turkey having to cross any formal threshold at all. [25]

Refugee streams cross borders carrying obligations that liberal democracies cannot refuse without violating their own identity. Courts intervene. Media amplifies. Municipal budgets strain. Coalition politics fracture. Elections polarise. The enabling actor remains external to consequence, while the receiving state disciplines itself.[26]

Once refugee movement is weaponised, it ceases to be a humanitarian by-product and becomes a managed resource. Controlled refugee streams can be stored, released, paused, resumed, or merely signalled. They do not need to be activated to retain effect. They need only to remain unresolved and available. [27]

In this context, crises are not anomalies to be avoided, but conditions to be governed. Some are prolonged because they continue to generate leverage. Others are stabilised just enough to prevent resolution. A crisis that already exists and produces pressure is a good crisis, and good crises should never be wasted. [28]

When no such crisis is available, one can be produced without fabrication. Conditions are adjusted rather than events invented. Enforcement is relaxed selectively. Movement is redirected. Visibility is increased at moments of political sensitivity. The crisis does not need to be large or continuous. It needs only to be legible to systems that cannot refuse to respond. [29]

This is why the weaponisation of refugee streams is so effective. It produces consequence without escalation and pressure without violation. It allows one actor to remain formally compliant while another absorbs cost internally through law, media, administration, and electoral politics. Nothing illegal is required. Nothing dramatic needs to occur. The burden is carried entirely by the receiving system. [30]

Nothing about this is new. Those who see refugees as useful instruments will weaponise them, and if no crisis exists to enable it, one will be created.

Happy New Years.

You include a wealth of detail about the life of a migrant worker in Dubai. What inspired you to write the story, and how did you go about researching it?

I lived in Dubai as a child and took ice-skating lessons there. I was so terrible at it that the instructor actually recommended to my mother that I give it up. I’d repressed this, naturally, until I went skating again as an adult in late 2022. I was still terrible, but my then partner was an excellent skater, and I loved watching him zip around the rink. Around the same time, the FIFA World Cup was being held in Qatar. I began to see stories in the news about the many laborers who’d died in the Gulf while working on infrastructure projects ramping up to the World Cup. The causes of death spanned from heatstroke to suicide. From there, I began to imagine two lives, two men—one who spent his time in the cold and the other in the heat. For research, I watched investigative documentaries and videos on YouTube that had been uploaded by men who lived in worker accommodations. I read whatever I could find about illegal recruitment fees and the other labor-related binds that migrant workers often find themselves in. I also went skating a few more times, with a friend who very kindly held my hand as we made our rounds. I often write stories in a burst, all at once, but this story came slowly, line by line.

The two men meet different fates, not so much thanks to luck but because one man has a greater awareness of the risks of the job and knows what to ask in advance. The narrative addresses the idea of predestination and, in a way, debunks it. Was that part of your plan for it from the beginning?

I can see where the next paragraph will go only when I’m standing on the precipice of it. So, no, I didn’t have much of a plan when I started, though I was drawn to the image of an inexperienced skater holding on to the side barrier of a rink and watching, mesmerized, as an experienced skater speeds across the ice. I was writing toward that scene, which, now that I’m thinking about it, might itself have the motif of two different fates: mobility and stasis, confidence and shame. I had also been reading Anne Carson’s translations of Euripides’ tragedies at the time. There is a line from “Herakles” that still haunts me: “In an instant, luck changes. / In an instant, children die.” I say this to point out all the ingredients on the counter.

Though the men are both manual laborers, they come from different circumstances. Yogan is from outside Lucknow, in northern India, and has a more provincial background; Samar, who is more worldly, is from Mumbai, to the south. Do those distinctions hold or become irrelevant once they reach Dubai?

I have always felt that distinctions between people from the same country fade when they come to a new place. What you have in common, as outsiders, is greater than what initially set you apart. What Yogan and Samar recognize in each other early on is a desire to better the conditions of the women they love, their families. They’re men in their twenties, just stepping into a new stage of life. They’re excited to talk about their wives, their dreams, their clothes! That is so much more interesting to them in that moment of meeting than where they’ve come from.

Yogan and Samar and their roommates arrive in Dubai with a limited sense of what awaits them, much of it gleaned from vloggers online. Their visions of their lives and their potential futures seem to draw more on what they’ve seen in Bollywood movies, which are a driving force in the story. Does Bollywood have that degree of influence?

Oh, yes! I am thinking particularly about the slate of films that came out in the late nineties and early two-thousands. The Bollywood dimension of this story took me by surprise, since I was never a film person and used to feel embarrassed by the big musical numbers, which were always about two people finally coming together in a large, familial display of affection and acceptance. I used to watch these movies with my parents, and something about their overly chaste rituals of romance felt even more suggestive to me than an onscreen kiss would have. I suppose I also didn’t want my parents to know how much I actually enjoyed watching these saccharine love stories! Which is to say that these films got into my bloodstream despite my resistance. In writing Yogan and Samar, who are both so earnest, I began to wonder how their lives would be different if, unlike me, they’d wholeheartedly embraced these films and their sentimentality, taking cues from the screen heroes to fuel their own courage and ambition and courtships. Where else do we learn what our lives could look like if not from movies (and books, of course)?

This is very rich territory for fiction. Did you consider writing a novel-length version of this story, or was it always intended as a short-form piece?

I think it was always going to be a story, though I definitely worried when it seemed to keep getting longer.

You have been working on your first novel. Does it relate in any way to “The Ice-Skater”? How challenging was it to make the leap from writing short fiction to a book-length narrative?

My novel, which I’ve just finished, unfolds over a few days in an apartment in Mumbai where two women—a college student and her childhood nanny—meet again after many years apart. The novel explores the strange, intimate relationship between them, a complicated kind of love; their bond is almost like that of a mother and daughter, but in a much more latent way. The book is divided into two parts, one told from the perspective of the student and one from the perspective of the former nanny. In order to make writing the novel seem less daunting to myself, I thought of it as two novellas side-by-side. Having the narrative take place within a limited time frame helped with that, too. After having written stories for so long, I’m still getting used to the roominess of a novel, how both characters and author have so much space in which to breathe. As I work on edits, I catch myself jumping through time the way I would in a story, in a single clause or with a line break, and then I realize that I can slow down, I can show the weather changing—such luxury! The substance of the novel is very different from “The Ice-Skater,” but I can see that it engages with similar ideas about immigration and what we might owe to those we’ve left behind in our home countries. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/694984ae17a442d99f43a62d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TNY_This_Week_In_Fiction_Kanak-Kapur.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 04:57:19.870859

Where Title II did not permit individual liability and where parents could not litigate such claims on behalf of their children pro se, the district court correctly dismissed plaintiff’s complaint.

Judgment is affirmed.

Criminal Law

Assault

Accessory After the Fact; Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to being an accessory after the fact to a fatal assault. After defendant pled guilty, the district court varied upward from the Guidelines range.

Where the district court properly applied the statutory sentencing factors and justified its upward variance based on the circumstances of defendant’s offense, there was no abuse of sentencing discretion.

Judgment is affirmed.

Assaulting a Federal Officer

Multiplicity; Sufficiency of Evidence

Defendant appealed his conviction on one count of assaulting a federal officer. Defendant faced five counts, with each count involving a different federal officer. Defendant argued that his charge on one count was redundant because his contact with that victim arose from his assault of two other officers. The district court denied the motion, arguing that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant took separate actions against each officer.

Where the record evidence showed that defendant assaulted each officer separately and successively, there was no error dismissing one of defendant’s charges.

Judgment is affirmed.

Attempted Sex Trafficking

Admission of Officer’s Lay Testimony; Denial of Downward Variance

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for attempted sex trafficking of a child and destruction of evidence, challenging the district court’s admission of the undercover officer’s lay opinion testimony, the denial of defendant’s motion to contact a juror, and the denial of a downward variance based on defendant’s claims of sentencing manipulation.

Where the undercover agent had testified about her text message conversations with defendant and based her testimony on her law enforcement training and knowledge of child sex-trafficking, such testimony was permissible lay opinion testimony to help the jury determine whether defendant believed he was conversing with an underage girl. Furthermore, defendant’s allegations about potential outside influence on the jury was mere conjecture. Finally, there was no sentencing manipulation by law enforcement in making the fake profile 13 years old to target individuals who preyed on younger children.

Judgment is affirmed.

Drug and Money Laundering Offenses

Plea Agreement; Appeal Waiver

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following her guilty plea to drug offenses and money laundering pursuant to a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver.

Where the appeal waiver was valid and enforceable, defendant was barred from raising sentencing challenges. Defendant also could not assert ineffective assistance of counsel claims due to her failure to move for substitution of counsel.

Appeal is dismissed.

Felon in Possession of Firearm

Career Offender Classification; Sentencing Enhancement

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, challenging the district court’s imposition of a sentencing enhancement after classifying defendant as a career offender. Defendant contended that the current Guidelines violated his constitutional rights.

Where past and present versions of the Guidelines included attempt in their definitions of crimes of violence, there was no error in designating defendant a career offender.

Judgment is affirmed.

Firearm Offense

Voluntariness of Plea Agreement; Appeal Waiver

Defendant appealed his conviction for a firearm offense pursuant to a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver, challenging the voluntariness of his plea.

Where defendant was precluded from challenging his plea due to his failure to seek to withdraw it, the court was constrained to dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.

Interstate Transport of Stolen Property

Upward Variance; Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to interstate transport of stolen property, arguing that the district court’s upward variance imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.

Where the uncontested facts supported the district court’s characterization of defendant’s crime as “well-planned,” and where the district court cited defendant’s prior criminal history, there was no abuse of discretion in varying upward.

Judgment is affirmed.

U.S. v. Johnson (MLW No. 84125/Case No. 24-2675 – 4 pages) (U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, per curiam) Appealed from U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, Ross, J.

Murder for Hire

Deceased Witness’s Statements; Hearsay

Defendant appealed his conviction for murder for hire and conspiracy, challenging the district court’s denial of his motion to question police about the statements of a deceased witness, which the district court had ruled were inadmissible hearsay.

Where the record contained overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt, any error in failing to permit the requested questioning was harmless.

Judgment is affirmed.

U.S. v. Cutler (MLW No. 84133/Case No. 24-2324 – 4 pages) (U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, per curiam) Appealed from U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, White, J.

Sentence Reduction

Eligibility; Mandatory Term of Imprisonment

Defendant appealed the denial of his request for a sentence reduction. Defendant was convicted of federal crimes in Montana and South Dakota, with his sentences set to run consecutively. After amendments to the First Step Act, defendant requested a reduction of his South Dakota sentence. The district court ordered briefing on whether defendant had served at least ten years “of the term of imprisonment.” After briefing, the district court concluded that he had not and thus was ineligible for a sentence reduction.

Where defendant had been sentenced to consecutive sentences and thus had only just started his South Dakota sentence, which was imposed after his Montana sentence, the district court correctly determined that he had not yet served at least ten years of the South Dakota sentence he wished to reduce, as eligibility focused on the term which a defendant wished to reduce, not how long they had spent incarcerated on their aggregate sentence.

Judgment is affirmed.

Supervised Release

Revocation; Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release, challenging the substantive reasonableness of the revocation sentence.

Where the district court properly considered the statutory sentencing factors and imposed a below-Guidelines sentence, there was no abuse of sentencing discretion.

Judgment is affirmed.

U.S. v. Burns (MLW No. 84126/Case No. 25-1974 – 2 pages) (U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, per curiam) Appealed from U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, Tostrud, J.

Immigration

Asylum

Withholding of Removal; Administrative Exhaustion

Petitioner sought review of the BIA’s order upholding an IJ’s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.

Where petitioner had failed to exhaust her claims of past persecution, the BIA properly deemed them waived, and petitioner’s future persecution claims also failed where she failed to exhaust the issue of whether internal relocation in Guatemala would be reasonable.

Petition for review denied.

Municipal

Business Closure

Fourteenth Amendment; Regulatory Taking

Plaintiffs appealed the grant of summary judgment to defendants. Defendants closed plaintiff’s inn due to various fire code violations that had not been remedied despite multiple warnings and a fire at the property. Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that the closure order violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights and alternatively constituted an uncompensated regulatory taking.

Where plaintiffs failed to show a deprivation of their procedural due process rights because the municipal regulations were sufficiently specific and provided for adequate post-deprivation due process due to the imminent danger posed by the code violations, there was no procedural violation, and the closure constituted a lawful exercise of the city’s police powers.

Judgment is affirmed.

Negligence

Plane Crash

Negligent Maintenance; Covenant Not to Use

The government appealed the district court’s denial of summary judgment. The plaintiff’s decedent was conducting an FAA checkride when his plane crashed, killing him. His spouse filed, suit, alleging that the government negligently maintained the plane. The government moved for summary judgment, invoking a covenant not to sue that the decedent had signed as an independent contractor to use government airplanes. The district court invalidated the covenant as against public policy.

Where the decedent was familiar with the covenant and, as an independent contractor, was not obligated to use government airplanes, and where the provision of airplanes was not a public or essential service, the district court erred in concluding that the covenant violated public policy.

(This story is part of an ongoing series on TiE New York by Darmin Bachu, a community activist with expertise in nonprofit governance and entrepreneurship.)

By Darmin Bachu

A lawsuit alleging governance failures, fiduciary breaches, and misconduct within TiE New York was filed in Queens County Supreme Court more than a month before the organization’s annual gala, according to newly reviewed court records. The filings raise fresh questions about what TiE New York’s leadership knew — and when — amid an escalating internal dispute that has now moved firmly into the judicial arena.

Court documents show that the lawsuit, brought by charter member Kesav Dama both individually and derivatively on behalf of TiE New York, was formally filed on November 11, 2025, and entered into the court system by November 14, 2025, weeks before the organization’s high-profile gala event.

According to individuals familiar with the matter and confirmed by service records referenced in the court filings, 10 of the 12 named defendants were served with legal papers at the TiE New York Gala.

The defendants include current and former board members and officers, among them then-President Jignesh Patel, Secretary Vaibhav Parikh, and multiple directors. TiE New York itself is named as both a nominal and direct defendant.

The gala — typically a celebratory fundraising and networking event — thus became the backdrop for the formal notification of litigation alleging that TiE NY’s board failed to act on repeated warnings about misconduct and governance violations.

Legal experts note that while service at a public event is unusual, it is not improper if defendants are otherwise difficult to serve or regularly appear together at scheduled functions.

Nature of the claims

The verified complaint asserts multiple causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, defamation, tortious interference with business relationships, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The claims center on allegations that TiE NY leadership:

Failed to investigate or discipline alleged misconduct by its president despite repeated written complaints;

Issued what the plaintiff characterizes as an improper and demeaning demand for evidence as a delaying tactic;

Allowed internal communications that allegedly defamed a charter member to remain uncorrected; and

Continued governance and election activities while litigation was imminent or already underway.

The lawsuit is brought in part under New York Not-for-Profit Corporation Law §720, which governs director and officer fiduciary duties.

Order to Show Cause

Alongside the complaint, the plaintiff filed an Order to Show Cause, seeking immediate court intervention. The requested relief includes:

Prohibiting TiE New York from spending organizational funds to defend the lawsuit;

Halting board elections or changes to election rules;

Preserving and producing board minutes and governing documents; and

Staying major governance actions pending judicial review.

Justice Karina E. Alomar of the Queens County Supreme Court signed the Order to Show Cause, initially setting a hearing for December 18, 2025, according to the court’s docket.

Court records further show that Jignesh Patel requested an adjournment of the December 18 hearing, which was subsequently delayed to December 22, 2025. The reason cited was the need for additional time following service and to prepare a response to the requested emergency relief.

The adjournment came as questions mounted about whether TiE NY leadership continued routine operations — including board activity and event planning — after the lawsuit had been filed and served.

The litigation marks a significant escalation from what began as an internal governance dispute. As previously reported, the complainant had submitted formal written complaints and demand letters weeks earlier, urging the immediate suspension of the president and warning of potential legal exposure if the board failed to act.

Newly reviewed records indicate that the complainant, through counsel, complied with requests for evidence within a compressed timeframe — yet the board allegedly declined to take disciplinary action prior to the lawsuit being filed.

By the time defendants were served at the gala, the dispute had already shifted from internal review to judicial oversight.

Governance transparency under scrutiny

Nonprofit governance specialists note that derivative lawsuits, especially those seeking to halt elections and restrict use of organizational funds, are among the most serious legal challenges a nonprofit board can face.

“Once an Order to Show Cause is granted, the court is signaling that the allegations merit immediate attention,” said one nonprofit governance attorney not involved in the case. “It also raises legitimate questions about whether directors are acting independently or protecting incumbents.”

The timing of service at the gala, combined with the delayed hearing request, may now become part of a broader factual record examined by the court.

TiE New York and the individual defendants have not publicly commented on the litigation. Requests for comment were not returned by press time.

As the case unfolds, it places renewed focus on transparency, accountability, and fiduciary responsibility within one of the region’s most prominent entrepreneurial nonprofit organizations — now facing scrutiny not only from its members, but from the courts.

(WFLA) — The Pinellas-Hillsborough Interfaith Coalition, a branch of the Florida Interfaith Coalition, along with other groups, is calling for changes to immigration enforcement across the state and the nation.

The groups have been holding weekly vigils to bring attention to their cause.

Reverend Wesley Snedeker of the Church of the Isles, United Church of Christ, is one of the organizers of the weekly vigils. He said the coalition’s most pressing request is to provide pastoral care to those being detained at Alligator Alcatraz, the migrant detention center near the Everglades.

“We’re seeing the separation of families,” Snedeker said.

“There have been reports of human rights abuses in state detention facilities, especially the one that has been called Alligator Alcatraz,” he said.

In mid-July, some migrants told The Associated Press they were being held in what they described as “zoo cages,” adding they were given toilets that would not flush, along with insects surrounding them and worms in their food. Shortly after, Florida Division of Emergency Management officials said those claims were false.

Protesters such as Brandt Robinson are also calling for an end to the detainment and deportation of non-violent criminals.

“The vast majority of undocumented immigrants to our country are doing the kinds of things that, frankly, a lot of us American citizens don’t want to do for a living,” Robinson said. “If you’re harvesting fruits and vegetables, if you’re processing our nation’s meat supplies, if you’re building the homes.”

Snedeker added to Robinson’s concern.

“Many of those folks end up living here in the United States as island citizens, working and paying taxes, who don’t have run-ins with law enforcement,” Snedeker said. “And these are some of the same folks that we’re seeing, who are detained.”

Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the White House has said entering the country illegally is the initial crime.

“If you are an individual, a foreign national who illegally enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal, so therefore you are subject to deportation,” a White House official said.

Lieutenant Governor Jay Collins has also been open about his stance on assisting the federal government.

“That doesn’t mean we don’t have empathy,” Collins said. “That means we have to follow through it, which we told them we were going to do. People ran on the ballot to solve these problems, and if they aren’t putting those actions, those words into action, what are they doing?”

A Turkish man who pleaded guilty to alien smuggling in a US federal court has exposed the growing reach of Turkish-run syndicates moving migrants into the United States through both the Mexican and Canadian borders.

The criminal complaint against Serkan Gökce, a Turkish national with prior US immigration violations, reveals a structured network relying on handlers in Canada, digital coordination via WhatsApp and prearranged pick-ups along remote border roads in upstate New York.

According to the complaint filed in the Northern District of New York, US Border Patrol agents detected movement near the Canadian border shortly before 3 a.m. on April 18, 2025. Remote sensor imagery captured several individuals walking through the woods toward the intersection of Scriver and Bush Road in Mooers Forks, an isolated crossing point known for frequent smuggling activity.

When agents arrived, they found three Turkish nationals who immediately admitted they had crossed into the US without legal documents. All three were taken into custody.

As the migrants were being processed, an agent observed a dark sedan behaving suspiciously near the same intersection. The vehicle slowed as if anticipating a rendezvous, then sped away. Agents followed and stopped the driver, identified as Gökce, who claimed he was trying to get to Plattsburgh, a statement inconsistent with his location, which matched the migrants’ description of the planned pick-up point.

The criminal complaint filed against a Turkish national for smuggling migrants into the United States:

At the Border Patrol station, one of the migrants, identified as D.C., agreed to a search of his phone. WhatsApp messages revealed he shared live GPS coordinates with Gökce throughout the crossing. D.C. also identified a Canada-based facilitator named T.Y., who arranged the smuggling operation and instructed migrants to look for a waiting Honda Civic, the same model Gökce was driving.

The three men apprehended with Gökce were not newcomers to illegal border crossings. Homeland Security records showed that all had previously been arrested for entering the United States illegally, two in Tecate, California, after crossing from Mexico in 2023, and one in El Paso, Texas, who later moved to Canada before attempting re-entry.

D.C. admitted he had earlier entered the US illegally from Mexico, lived there, then moved to Canada, from which he sought to re-enter the United States through an organized smuggling route run by Turkish nationals in Montreal and across the Quebec–New York border. He told investigators he paid $1,500 to T.Y. in Canada, and another $1,500 was to be paid to Gökce after the successful pick-up.

The arrangement mirrors patterns US authorities have increasingly documented since 2023: Turkish migrants paying large sums to well-organized cross-border facilitators who exploit the relative openness of the US–Canada frontier and the heavily trafficked Mexico routes.

Gökce himself had a known history with US immigration authorities. He was previously arrested in El Paso in 2022 and issued a Notice to Appear after entering the United States unlawfully. The new complaint shows he later became involved in transporting migrants, serving as a driver instructed to retrieve border crossers based on real-time digital location updates.

The case, signed by US Magistrate Judge Gary L. Favro and sworn by Border Patrol Agent Chase D. Beatty, offers a rare inside look at how Turkish smuggling networks operate with logistical hubs in Mexico, Canada and Turkey and use US borderlands as staging grounds for coordinated, technology-enabled crossings.

Gökce pleaded guilty to federal alien-smuggling charges, a felony that carries significant prison time. His cooperation, according to sources familiar with similar cases, may assist investigators in mapping a broader transnational smuggling structure that has moved thousands of Turkish nationals into the United States in recent years.

US immigration enforcement data reveal a dramatic rise in the number of Turkish nationals entering the United States over the past five years. The shift reflects a fundamental change in Turkey’s outward migration patterns, driven by political repression, economic instability and the rapid expansion of transcontinental smuggling pipelines stretching from Istanbul to Mexico and Central America.

US Customs and Border Protection data show that encounters with Turkish nationals at US borders surged to 18,986 in fiscal year (FY) 2023, which runs from October 2022 to September 2023, before easing to 13,311 in FY 2024 and then falling further to 5,192 in FY 2025. In FY 2026 encounters with Turks stood at 304 so far.

In fiscal year 2024, according to official data, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 37 Turkish nationals on criminal convictions, pending criminal charges or other immigration violations. The figure for fiscal year 2025 stands at 10 so far. Detentions involving Turkish nationals totaled 707 in FY 2024 and rose to 1,198 in FY 2025. In terms of removals, ICE deported 547 Turkish nationals in FY 2024, compared with 151 removals recorded in FY 2025.

The trajectory points to a sharp spike in irregular migration by Turkish citizens in 2023, followed by a marked decline over the subsequent two years, a shift that coincides with tighter border controls, changing smuggling routes and evolving US enforcement practices, while still leaving Turkish nationals as a visible component of non-traditional migration flows at the border.

Meanwhile, the Turkish government’s crackdown on human smugglers under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has remained largely ineffective. Most investigations have ended in dismissals, acquittals or the release of suspects, including individuals who profit from migrant smuggling in partnership with international criminal syndicates, underscoring the persistent failure to hold key actors accountable.

Publicly, Turkish authorities continue to boast about the number of detentions, prosecutions and court cases involving migrant smuggling. In practice, however, convictions remain rare, and the criminal justice system appears to have failed to stem the flow of illegal migration.

According to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, who briefed lawmakers in parliament on November 17, 2025, 3,627 migrant smugglers were arrested in 2025. In 2024 Yerlikaya announced a comparable figure, stating that 3,924 individuals were arrested in connection with migrant smuggling. The near-identical arrest numbers from one year to the next suggest that the government’s strategy of targeting organizers has failed to produce any meaningful deterrent effect.

Rather than declining, the caseload in Turkey’s judicial system continues to expand. According to the latest available data from the Justice Ministry, 26,314 prosecutions related to migrant and human smuggling were underway nationwide, involving 45,976 suspects. In 2024 alone prosecutors launched 13,140 new investigations, targeting 19,735 suspects.

Of these cases, 15,424 were brought before criminal courts, charging 32,538 suspects, while 7,776 new cases were filed in criminal courts in 2024 alone. At the appellate level, the dysfunction is even more apparent: More than 700 convictions were overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeals in the same year, further weakening the judicial response.

Taken together, the figures underscore a systemic failure under the government of President Erdogan. Despite thousands of arrests and a growing prosecutorial backlog, migrant-smuggling networks, often operating in coordination with international criminal syndicates, continue to function with near impunity, highlighting the gap between official rhetoric and meaningful enforcement.",https://nordicmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251105__83376G4__v1__MidRes__UsMexicoBorderSecurity.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 20:56:19.886997

The federal government, offering up to $280 million, has recently signed at least two contracts with private surveillance firms to hunt down immigrants at their homes and places of work, according to various reports.

One of the companies, BI Incorporated, is a subsidiary of GEO Group, a for-profit prison company that currently does business with the government jailing detained immigrants, according to The Intercept.

Trump administration proposals to use private tracking and investigative services have been circulating for months. Lawmakers in two states, Missouri and Mississippi, introduced legislation to create their own bounty hunter programs, but those bills stalled.

The new federal contracts broaden the administration’s use of the private sector in immigration enforcement. For instance, BI Incorporated has had past government contracts in immigrant surveillance with ankle monitor-based tracking.

The new contracts, one of which goes to a company called AI Solutions 87, mostly seek software and artificial intelligence investigative services, but the door is open for on-the-ground tracking. However, reporting by The Intercept and 404 Media suggests once the immigrant targets are pinpointed, federal agents would move in to detain and arrest them.

In requesting bids, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was looking for private “Skip Tracing and Process Serving Services using Government furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification and physical observation services . . .”

In general, skip tracing is the process of tracking down people who are missing, unresponsive, or hard to find, according to Bosco Legal Services. Often, the practice is used to find individuals who have unpaid debts or failed to meet other obligations and may have “skipped” town.

ICE considered “performance-based incentives” for the contractors, but the final proposal for request apparently did not include bonus language or specific per-head bounties, according to Snopes, nor did it include the term “bounty hunter.”

But the contracts call for hunting down people for money.

“Under ICE’s proposed system, vendors would be given 10,000 noncitizens to identify, verify, and/or serve with documents, with a potential to receive ‘further increments of 10,000 aliens,’” according to the Immigration Policy Tracking Project.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has been an outspoken critic of the private tracking program, which he said “would effectively establish a ‘bounty hunter’ model.”

He sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing “grave concern” about the initiative, according to his office.

Krishnamoorthi warned the proposal would “outsource one of the government’s most coercive powers to actors who operate with little oversight and limited public accountability.” He wrote that such an arrangement “risks creating an enforcement apparatus that functions beyond the reach of ordinary checks and balances.”

“When citizens can no longer discern who acts in the name of government, trust gives way to fear,” he added. “A government that rules through confusion and coercion rather than law and consent erodes its own legitimacy and the freedoms it exists to protect.”

Some of the tactics of federal agents and officials have already come under fire at times as overly aggressive, lacking due process and failing to clarify who the enforcers work for. In some cases, U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal authority to be in the country have been jailed for days with little or no information as to why they were detained.

The bills in Missouri and Mississippi appeared to be bonified bounty hunter proposals, with a $1,000 reward for assisting in the arrest of an undocumented immigrant.

“I’m finding a tremendous amount of support. It’s actually gaining support across the country,” state Sen. David Gregory, a Republican from St. Louis, told Newsweek early this year.

That didn’t happen. The two bills, which were similar, went nowhere.

The legislation also had language that allowed law enforcement in the states to assist the federal government in enforcing immigration violations. Yet Gregory, the author of the Missouri bill, noted police departments are stretched thin.

“The federal government, ICE, has been asking, in fact, begging for support from the state and local law enforcement officers across the entire country,” Gregory said. “So, part of this bill is the framework that requires that cooperation, number one.”

“But number two, what we’re looking for is some sort of supplement, some sort of augmentation to the program, because a lot of major cities across the country are short on police. We’re already short. We’re already overwhelmed.”

The United States has had a checkered history deploying bounty hunters, who at times were compensated for capturing, or killing, individuals. This notably happened during the Civil War with enlistment bounties to track down deserters. Governments in the expanding country offered money for Native American scalps in the 16th through 19th centuries.

In recent and far less violent times, bail bondsmen have employed private detectives and bounty hunters to track down bail jumpers, and the U.S. Department of Justice has rewarded whistleblowers who uncover immigration violations in the workplace.

There are laws across the country that allow intervener lawsuits with potential payouts for the third parties, including a statute in Texas that “deputizes” citizens to sue people providing or aiding in an abortion.

The tracking contracts focus solely on immigrants. Right now, a lot of news media and citizens are monitoring immigration enforcement by federal officials.

No doubt that focus will be extended to this new high-tech immigrant tracking chapter.

A series of immigration raids across California in 2025 had one thing in common: Most of the federal agents detaining people wore masks over their faces.

In January, the state of California and its largest county will ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with a few exceptions, putting local and state police at odds with masked immigration agents.

The state law gives law enforcement officers a choice: If they cover their faces, they lose the ability to assert “qualified immunity,” the doctrine that protects officers from individual liability for their actions. That means they can be sued for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest or malicious prosecution, and the law adds a clause that says the minimum penalty for committing those offenses while wearing a mask is $10,000.

Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat who co-authored the law, said it was necessary to rein in anonymous federal agents.

“We initially were under the understanding that, oh, they’re only targeting folks who were not citizens,” Gonzalez said, “And then actually over time, you learn they don’t give a s— who you are, they’re attacking you no matter what, with no due process.”

The Trump administration has sued to block the bill, and more than a century of federal court precedent is on its side. An 1890 Supreme Court case provides that a state cannot prosecute a federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties.

The Trump administration said in its brief to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that forcing agents to reveal their identities would put the agents at risk.

During Immigration and Customs Enforcement “actions, individuals can be heard threatening to doxx and find out who officers and their family members are and where they live,” the administration’s lawyers said in the Nov. 17 brief. “There are even public websites that seek and publish personal information about ICE and other federal officers to harass and threaten them and their families.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, said the issue may not be as cut-and-dried as one or two Supreme Court cases. He pointed to a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the case of a federal sniper who killed a woman during the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, standoff to go to trial.

“It basically says that a federal officer can be criminally prosecuted for unreasonable actions,” Chemerinsky said. “Federal officers, by virtue of being federal officers, do not get immunity from all state civil and criminal laws.”

Brian Marvel, president of an organization that represents California police unions, said the law will make life harder for local cops and county sheriffs’ deputies. The organizations that represent police chiefs, sheriffs, agents in the Attorney General’s office and California Highway Patrol officers opposed the law too.

“I think that the state has put us in a tenuous position with this battle they’re having with the Trump administration,” said Marvel, of the Peace Officers Research Association of California. “We don’t want to be in the middle of this fight. But unfortunately, (with) the desire for higher name recognition and elections in 2026, they decided to create things that are much more political and not geared toward legitimate public safety issues.”

Marvel said another drawback of the law is giving “a false sense of hope to the immigrant community in California” that the law will force federal agents to leave the state.

Los Angeles County supervisors have also approved a local mask ban on law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county, a measure that will go into effect in mid-January, unless a court decision comes sooner.

Gonzalez noted that masks have played a significant role in recent California history. First, during the pandemic, California temporarily made masks mandatory in public and at work. Then, a couple of years later, a rush of smash-and-grab robberies were harder to solve because the suspects all wore masks. Now, California finds itself in its third back-and-forth over face coverings.

The law provides exemptions for N-95 or medical-grade masks to prevent infection transmission, and permits undercover operatives to wear a mask.

“This is specifically aimed to federal agents because we gotta combat these kidnappings somehow,” Gonzalez said, “and this was our way in.”

The Supreme Court’s emergency docket is designed as a way for parties in lower court proceedings to seek a pause of that court’s ruling or injunction, and the justices typically reject most petitions they receive. Through the first 11 months of the second Trump administration, the high court has received more than 30 petitions to its emergency docket from the Justice Department and has sided with the DOJ all but three times.

Trump’s victories on the emergency docket span a variety of issues, including massive plans to trim the size of the federal workforce. In July, the high court granted stays in two petitions, allowing mass layoffs at the Department of Education, along with a more sweeping reduction-in-force effort at various federal agencies.

The Trump administration was also successful in a trio of emergency petitions over the firing of independent agency heads, beginning with a lawsuit over the firing of Democrat-appointed members of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board. The May order in Trump v. Wilcox found that the president “may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.”

The two later emergency petitions, dealing with firings of members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, respectively, were also granted by the high court. The FTC firing case, Trump v. Slaughter, was taken up by the justices on an expedited basis to the merits docket, with the justices appearing likely to expand presidential firing power within the executive branch based on December 2025 oral arguments in the case.

The other wins the Trump administration got on the emergency docket included allowing the policy of banning transgender people from the military, mandating that the gender listed on passports is that person’s biological sex, and allowing the deportation of illegal immigrants to countries other than their country of origin.

The decisions have largely been on ideological lines, with the six justices appointed by Republican presidents largely siding with the administration, while the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents generally said they would deny the emergency requests.

While the Trump administration has been overwhelmingly successful on the emergency docket, it has had a mixed track record on emergency petitions regarding immigration policy. Two key losses on the emergency docket for the Trump administration included the high court ordering the administration to “facilitate” the return of illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, after he was deported to El Salvador despite a withholding order against such action, and halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in Texas in May.

Limiting universal injunctions is first win on the merits docket for Trump

While the Trump administration had dozens of cases on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, it only saw one case argued and decided by the justices on their merits docket in 2025. The lone ruling was a significant victory in the fight against universal injunctions.

One of the issues that emerged during the early months of Trump’s second term was lower courts’ prolific use of universal injunctions, which blocked administration policies and actions nationwide, instead of just the parties to the lawsuit. The administration brought to the Supreme Court a trio of universal injunctions blocking the president’s birthright citizenship order, asking for the high court to limit lower courts’ ability to issue these sweeping orders.

In the 6-3 ruling in Trump v. CASA, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, dismissed the idea that lower courts have the broad ability to issue universal injunctions, significantly limiting their ability to do so.

“The universal injunction was conspicuously nonexistent for most of our Nation’s history,” Barrett wrote in the June 2025 ruling. “Its absence from 18th- and 19th-century equity practice settles the question of judicial authority. That the absence continued into the 20th century renders any claim of historical pedigree still more implausible.”

“Had federal courts believed themselves to possess the tool, surely they would not have let it lay idle,” she added.

The ruling was celebrated by the Trump administration, but since the CASA ruling, lower courts have still found other ways to issue sweeping injunctions, including through class action lawsuits and through lawsuits where states are parties against the federal government. Despite the continued lawsuits and court-ordered pauses of policies post-CASA, the June ruling still marked a major win for the Trump administration.

2026 may be a mixed bag for Trump at the Supreme Court

While the Trump administration got a favorable ruling for the one case it brought to the merits docket, the upcoming cases the high court will consider could be unfavorable to the president.

At the end of 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases brought against the Trump administration over two major issues: the president’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs and his ability to fire independent agency heads. Early in 2026, the high court is also expected to hear arguments over whether Trump’s executive order regarding birthright citizenship is constitutional.

Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University, previously told the Washington Examiner he believes the administration is likely to lose the tariffs case and the birthright citizenship case, but would likely prevail in the independent agency head firing case.

SUPREME COURT GRAPPLES WITH HOW MUCH EXECUTIVE POWER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES REALLY EXERT

During oral arguments over Trump’s tariffs in November 2025, the justices appeared skeptical of the president’s ability to levy sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Conversely, in oral arguments over Trump’s bid to fire independent agency heads without cause in December 2025, a majority of the justices seemed likely to side with the administration.

Oral arguments in the birthright citizenship case, Trump v. Barbara, are expected to occur sometime between February and April 2026, with decisions in all three major Trump cases expected by the end of June 2026.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25087712274742.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-12-28 15:56:40.160236

Leaning over Samar, Yogan saw that he was wide awake.
“I’m a dead man,” Samar said.
I’ve barely eaten today, man.” Yogan started to give Samar what he could.
It was Roshni that Yogan was thinking of that day with Samar, Roshni he imagined when their fingers were intertwined.","They were young men when they first met. Both of them in skinny jeans and American-branded T-shirts, purchased at a greater cost than either would have admitted to his family. Samar’s T-shirt read “GUESS?,” and Yogan’s “American Eagle.” The meaning of these inscriptions did not matter to them, though Yogan suspected that his had something to do with the American postal service, and this excited him. Samar’s T-shirt was tight around his chest in a film-hero kind of way, the polyester adhering to the curves of his boyish biceps, and he later admitted to Yogan that this elasticity, rather than the English word on his chest, was what had convinced him to make the purchase.

It was the T-shirts that had sparked their first conversation, each asking the other, “Do you speak English?” English was necessary in order to navigate the airport, and, they expected, life in this new city called Dubai, which was in so many ways an imitation of a major Western city. But English had come to both men only piecemeal, from the dazzling, incongruous lines in Bollywood films. The plots of those movies and their many twists had vanished; what Yogan and Samar recalled was Shah Rukh Khan, with his signature wide-eyed look, ordering Kajol to “take a chill pill!” And Kajol, mocking her hoity-toity London neighbors with “Would you like some tea?” Thanks to a joint effort drawing on both men’s vocabularies, they made it through immigration and baggage claim and out to the arrivals hall, where a red-haired woman with a laminated sign motioned for them to wait for the shuttle that would take them to their accommodations.

Only a few months earlier, Yogan’s wife had sent him out to look for more long-term work. His last construction contract had recently ended, and Roshni had suddenly vomited a hot stream of bile onto her bare feet after her morning tea. That afternoon, a drug-store test had informed them that she was pregnant with their second child. And so Yogan had been sternly dispatched to pass under a sign that read “KISMAT JOB AGENCY,” and into a roadside shop that smelled of a sporty, masculine cologne. Inside, another banner in lowercase English script read “quick overseas enquiry all welcome.”

Overseas, quick: the words themselves had a certain voltage.

The shop had a running air-conditioner, pristine white walls, and a statuette of Lord Ganesh attached to the plastic desk with a hardened dollop of liquid glue. Behind the screen of a laptop was a heavyset man, sitting as still as an oracle.

“Your name, your date of birth, your phone number,” the man said. He wore a thick gold chain over his collared shirt and repeatedly clicked one of two buttons on his wired mouse. Once Yogan had delivered the requested information, the man licked his index finger and handed him a sheet of paper setting out the conditions of his potential employment. The compensation, converted to rupees, was more than triple what he had made on his last contract.

“This is the only job I have available at the moment. You’ll go abroad?” the man asked.

Thanks to local gossip, Yogan already thought of the man as someone he needed to impress. He had worn his American Eagle T-shirt to the appointment. But the possibility of this new future made him aware of his own timidity. “What is it like over there, uncle?” he asked.

“Big, big buildings,” the man said, not once looking up from the screen of his computer. “And the roads are clean. Food and all is expensive, of course, but the quality is much better. Everything is imported, no? You’ll see, beta.”

It relaxed Yogan to be called “son.” He wondered if delivering this word, so affectionately, was part of the man’s training. But he felt disarmed enough to hint at his other question, which had been weighing on his mind since Roshni had broached the idea of his working in Dubai.

“My wife is expecting, uncle. Our second. We have one girl. I thought I should tell you that. I’ve heard the stories, you know.”

“What stories?” the man asked. Now he looked up from his computer and caught Yogan’s eye. No longer fatherly, Yogan thought, but shrewd, gruff.

“These men who hire us—I’ve heard they might arrange things so we can’t come back.”

“Rubbish!” the man said. Small, yellowish teeth appeared under the heft of his mustache; he was silently laughing. “If they did all that nonsense, then why would I have so many applications to process, hmm?” He pointed at a towering stack of folders behind him.

“Times have changed,” the man added. “Those stories are old. Bygone.”

Relieved, Yogan filled out his application and waited, over the next few weeks, for his phone to ring.

It had all happened differently for Samar.

Samar was from Mumbai, itself a big city, one that Yogan had always imagined as a sparkling place, the backdrop of his favorite movies, where A-list actors could be spotted sauntering through bazaars with their big sunglasses and hotheaded bodyguards. Samar wouldn’t have been as easily swayed by the hum of a working laptop and unstained white paint, Yogan guessed, for his new friend had laughed in a slightly superior way at these details of Yogan’s story.

“So why did you come then?” Yogan asked.

Sitting against a concrete wall outside the airport, using his duffel as a backrest, Samar told the story of the time he was hired to install a stripper pole in a Bollywood heroine’s Pali Hill flat. “The work order listed it as exercise equipment,” Samar said, “but I’ve seen enough movies. I know what people do with something like that.”

The actress was not there at the time of the installation, Samar said, but her home was decorated more extravagantly than he could have imagined. There, he saw furniture that he hadn’t known existed beyond film sets. A circular mattress, a crystal chandelier, lavender carpeting throughout. Samar had looked around not with envy, he said, but with reverence. The pole was to be installed in a third bedroom, which was also a dressing room, or so he guessed from the light bulbs around the mirrors and the many racks of frilly clothes. Later, in the chawl where he shared a single matchbox room with his wife, Samar began compulsively picturing the actress moving through her flat as he moved through his own. As he refilled the water drum at the communal taps for their morning tea, Samar imagined the actress draping her shoulders with the impossibly soft shawl that had been flung over the sofa, before dropping a tea bag into one of her many porcelain cups. In a moment of contemplation, she might hold the cup against her chest for warmth, he thought, for her air-conditioner would be rattling fiercely, set to a temperature of seventeen degrees Celsius.

“Seventeen degrees!” Samar said, bringing his hands together to clap at the number. “We were sweating and shivering at the same time as we worked!”

Yogan listened to his new friend with a dignified silence. He had never known anyone who had seen a stripper pole in person before. “Wow,” he said.

Samar appeared relieved to have told someone. He’d had to keep all this a secret, he admitted. He was newly married to a woman named Chanda, and it had been enough of a scandal that they’d met in a park and not through a relative’s introduction. The story of the actress’s apartment would have infuriated Chanda’s brothers, who had never liked Samar and, he predicted, would never try to.

It had been difficult not to talk to his wife about that day, how it had changed the way he looked at his life, Samar continued. The next morning, he had shaved his head to a greenish stubble in front of the bathroom mirror—a way of taking fewer trips to the barber. When Chanda saw him, her first reaction had been to howl for help. In their dimly lit room, she’d thought him a stranger. When she’d finally accepted that it was him, she placed her hands on his shoulders, his neck, the base of his skull, and, finally, his prickly scalp, which Samar rubbed now, sitting outside the airport. He wondered aloud if Chanda had been able to tell that there were desires in him that hadn’t been there before, if she had worried about what this could mean for her own life.

“I came home and really saw everything,” Samar said. “I saw where we lived, and it hurt me to see so clearly.”

What did he see? Cracks in the walls, rat pellets in the cupboard, a sudsy creep of water under the door, because the aunties outside were forever washing their saris and utensils. For once he was bothered by the many abuses that the warring grandfathers who lived above them hurled at each other through the night.

Chanda had unrolled her thin bedding on the floor, to sleep. Her long braid, tossed behind her when she turned, was held at the end with a knot made of her own hair. For months, Samar had heard her complain about her hips and knees, tender after her days of squatting in rich people’s flats with a wet rag, wiping their marble floors from end to end. He had always dismissed these aches as inevitabilities of their lot, but now he felt his wife’s pain under his own skin.

Samar had expected this new clarity to pass, the way drunken bouts of insight and sadness often did, but visions of the actress’s apartment continued to follow him. Nights when he got home, he could hear her blowing air-conditioner. He could see her silky two-piece pajamas, hanging from a crystal hook in the bathroom. Samar understood that Chanda and the actress were two women separated by money and luck. He had control over one of those things; he could find better paying work.

Some days later, he told Yogan, he woke up to his heart pounding with impatience, which told him that it was time to find a solution. He went to a recruiting agency down the road and signed a contract that very day. It was still early when he got home. In clouded morning light, he lay on Chanda’s mat with her and told her the news: soon he would start working for a construction company in Dubai.

Sixty or so men had flown in that day from Karachi, Kathmandu, and Mumbai. The red-haired woman appeared again a few hours later to usher them onto the bus that would take them to their camp, about an hour outside the city. But, before that could happen, some men were called by name and asked for their passports. The company needed to process their visas, the woman said, but Yogan already suspected that he’d got himself a different deal than the men obediently lining up before him. Could he, from where he sat, a flutter in his own chest, issue some kind of warning? Yogan silently watched as Samar placed his blue-black booklet into the woman’s outstretched palm.

On the bus, one or two men tried to broach the subject, curious as to whether the others had been made to give up their papers earlier, at immigration or baggage claim. No verdicts had been reached yet, but already the passports were a touchy subject. Those with elderly parents or young children put an end to the discussion: “Brother, if I keep thinking about this, I’ll fall into a depression.”

She wanted to know whether he’d arrived safely, if he could send her any pictures. He slipped his phone back into his pocket without responding. Watching the bright, silvery buildings, Yogan wanted to enjoy the solitary bolt of desire that was beginning to course through him. He imagined that this was how Samar must have felt as he walked around the actress’s flat—as if something divine and chemical were taking shape in his body, the birth of a new ambition.

Behind and in front of him, there were conversations about how clean the city was. Not a single crushed bottle of Coke or a billowing plastic bag, just miles and miles of pure asphalt. The men wondered where the poor without homes slept, where the stray dogs with bitten ears and tragic faces prowled.

“Maybe they bring out cleaners at night,” one man suggested. “They must have machines that do it.”

“I’ve heard they make the prisoners do it,” a voice from the back said.

The silver buildings grew smaller and smaller, until they became like motes of dust on the horizon. As the bus turned in to their accommodations, the men’s chatter began to slow. In their silence was the realization that the streets surrounding where they were going to live were as littered as the others had been spotless. Here, it seemed, were all the city’s tossed water bottles and flattened cartons. Rumbles coursed through the bus as the men understood this, one by one.

There were well-circulated rumors about the camps—the unlivable conditions, the filth. White men making documentaries had uploaded clips to YouTube. On his phone, months ago, Yogan had watched one of those men, retching at the smell of the camp bathrooms, fight his way past disgruntled security guards to an open courtyard where he could breathe fresh air. It was an old video, from the early twenty-tens, but it was still the one that had the most views. These days, a new generation of vloggers, armed with hair gel and smartphones, were uploading their own clips detailing their day-to-day lives inside the camps, as a way of encouraging other men to make the move. One vlogger, a man from Kabul, went live on Facebook once a month to counsel other men from the region on how to secure employment in the Gulf. Yogan and Roshni had spent hours, after their daughter was asleep, watching this man’s pixelated face as he walked the halls of his accommodations, answering questions.

Yogan suspected that everyone on the bus had watched the man from Kabul’s videos, and felt, as he had, their plans for another life coming joyously together. Though the man had been careful to temper his viewers’ hopes. Recently, he had begun signing off at the end of each of his videos with a disclaimer: “This is only one humble man’s experience, please remember. God has different plans for each of us.”

As Yogan disembarked from the bus, he recalled the man from Kabul’s warning. The sight of the accommodations heavied his chest. Here were stout buildings of cement, not shimmering glass; men already residing in some of the rooms had fixed yellowing newspapers to the windows, to block out the heat. Others had gathered to watch the slothful procession of newcomers file out of the narrow bus doors and into the courtyard, where fallen wickets lay from an abandoned game of cricket. Yogan leaned into Samar’s shoulder to try to put words to what they were both feeling: “You think we’ll ever see the inside of those nice buildings?”

Samar seemed to eye him with a twinge of anger. “I’m just here to work,” he said.

In the room, they agreed to share a bunk, Samar at the top, Yogan at the bottom. They’d known to expect it, but still, as the door kept opening and closing, and one man after another walked in with suitcases and basmati-rice sacks stuffed with clothing, with burners and steel pots, with statuettes of Krishna and leather-bound Qurans, they grew more and more disheartened, until the last man entered and looked at Yogan’s bottom bunk with entitlement, and Yogan knew to climb up and lie beside his new friend, too exhausted by then to care that their calves and elbows were touching.

In the dark, they looked at each other wordlessly, all the rapture of their stories blunted. The man from Kabul had warned about the number of men assigned to each room. “I won’t lie to you,” he had said. “You’ll be uncomfortable. You’ll have to adjust.” But Yogan had hoped—though he didn’t admit it—that this, too, was a story of bygone times. When Samar began to cry, a mewling, stifled sound, Yogan brought his friend’s head into his chest. He whispered that they’d arrived, not only to a big city but to a new country. They were abroad, and the sun would bring them a new start. He was sure of it.

“Listen, blokes, we’re on a tight schedule, everything is very tight, including my pants and my shirt, and as our time gets tighter we’ll be in tight shit.”

Scattered laughter.

It was late one night, almost a year after they’d arrived. Samar was impersonating his supervisor, a beer-bellied foreigner who, the men had decided, hailed from either Australia or New Zealand. They weren’t sure of his origins, in part owing to his confounding accent, which required him to repeat instructions five different times at five different speeds, but they had eliminated the possibility of England because of the supervisor’s coffee flask, a ceramic blue-lidded thing with the emblem of a crown on its front.

“No British person actually cares about the Queen,” one of the men declared, his legs dangling from his top bunk across the room. “To them, it’s just another loaded family living in a big house, running a family business.”

Samar said, “In one of the houses where Chanda does her cleaning, there’s a glass cabinet under lock and key. Inside there are plates of every size and color, with the Queen’s face on them. They are not for eating, her madam said. They are for dis-play.”

At night, the men usually returned to the accommodations in silence. Most of them worked construction in different sites across the city. Samar’s group, which included a couple of the other men in their shared room, was building a highly anticipated sporting stadium that was already six months behind schedule. This meant that their work was now proceeding at double speed, for there was some kind of televised event nearing, something glamorous and exclusive, that required tickets to be purchased months in advance. Under the new schedule and supervisor, the stadium was expected to open in just a year.

“You come to these places free, and then they put you in chains,” another man said, pursuing his own, separate line of thought.

The others were used to this man’s abrupt, tragic declarations. “Oh, tell Baldy to go write his poems elsewhere!” someone called.

Yogan had heard that the supervisor on Samar’s project had limited the men’s bathroom breaks to once a day. Twelve hours of work, with just one sliver of peace in which to piss. Some men had taken to climbing down to a basement floor, where there was no light, only rubble, to relieve themselves. Their previous shift manager had allowed them to use the bathroom to wash their hands before eating, but the Australian told them to use the water from their bottles to rinse off, and, when those bottles were empty, he said, they would make adequate vessels for holding urine. There was no refilling water bottles during work hours. Men who ran out had to wait until they got home. In just the last week, two men had fainted from heat stroke, and another had coughed up a smear of bloody phlegm.

The men speculated that the heat was making the Australian insane. The high temperatures must have overloaded the synapses of his brain; this was the only possible explanation for his howling and redness and reverence of the Crown.

Yogan listened to all this night after night, shaking his head when a show of disapproval was required. He had yet to encounter any such cruelty in his own working life.

Now Samar said, “You don’t come to places like this already free. You come looking for freedom.”

“Maybe the Australian’s wife left him,” the man with the dangling legs said. “Maybe one day he came home, his skin peeling everywhere, and she said, ‘Enough of this! You think I want to spend my life applying ointment to your red-red nose?’ ”

“Wife! You think a man like that ever had a woman waiting for him at home? Feeding him biryani?”

“Someone is keeping him well fed.”

Laundry was hung on lines across the room, blocking Yogan’s view of some of his friends’ faces. He was lying in his bed beside Samar, freshly bathed. In the next room, the air-conditioner was switched on, and the gentle vibration of it through the wall lulled him closer and closer to sleep.

Hours later, from the darkness of his dreams, Yogan was woken by the sound of cloth snapping against air, a quick, practiced swatting, the kind an overworked mother might deliver to the fat behind of her wailing child. “Shoo!” one of the men was saying, as if to a mosquito. “Go bother someone else.” Others in the room groaned at the noise.

It was difficult for the men to drop back into sleep when they awoke in the middle of the night like this; they became aware of the vivid odor of sweat hanging in the air, the white floodlights seeping through the broken blinds.

“Come fan me for ten minutes and I’ll give you a dirham,” a man on Yogan’s side of the room said.

His eyes now adjusted to the half-light, Yogan sat up and saw a figure cross the floor to where the voice had come from. After the room’s air-conditioning unit had broken weeks ago, the men had started collecting old newspapers to wave in front of their bedmate’s face at night. This way, at least one man in each bed could sleep decently in the heat. Yogan watched as the figure crouched to pick up a newspaper then hit his head on something metal, the railing of the bed, perhaps, on his way back up. “Ouuuch!” the man said. The clang reverberated like a gong, a sound that should have signalled the coming of sunrise or morning prayers, but only reminded Yogan that it was still night, and he’d have to find a way to return to sleep.

Yogan reached over to the other side of his bed, to alert Samar to the scene. This was the kind of incident they liked to feast on together in the daylight, drawing out the small animosities that grew among roommates. Gossip made them feel alive, childlike. Yogan’s hand found only a cool, empty patch of sheet. It took him a moment to understand that Samar was not in the bed, and that, if he wasn’t in the bed, it had to be Samar out in the middle of the floor with the newspaper, Samar getting swatted.

“What are you doing, you idiot?” he called into the dark.

“What do you bastards think this is, a fish market?” another voice said.

Yogan watched his friend drop the newspaper on the floor and return to their bunk. With a sharp breath, Samar hoisted himself up and collapsed beside Yogan, a palm on his forehead, as if he were checking himself for a fever. Countless nights over the past few weeks, Yogan had opened his eyes to the sight of Samar propped up on one elbow, holding a newspaper above Yogan’s bare chest, fanning committedly. “Go back to sleep,” Samar would urge. “Tomorrow it’s my turn,” his voice so sweetly nurturing that Yogan had wondered whether he’d forgotten to mention some secret child back in Mumbai. Now it was Yogan who propped himself up; he unfolded a newspaper from under their mattress and began to create a small wind for the two of them. “What were you doing?” he asked.

“Nothing,” Samar said. “Don’t make everything your problem.”

Yogan lightly smacked Samar’s forehead with the newspaper. “Oho, what drama!”

But Samar wouldn’t speak. Another voice in the room answered for him. “He was asking for spare change. What else does he ask us for?”

At this, Samar clicked his tongue, sending his reply to the middle of the room. “You’re a real son of a bitch, you are!”

“Why do you need their money?” Yogan asked.

Samar again clicked his tongue, that universal sound that meant, Leave it, leave me. Drop the conversation. He turned away from Yogan to sleep.

“Do you have any news?” Roshni’s voice on the phone was booming, blooming, both.

“News, how?” Yogan said.

“You know—news!”

His wife’s questions on the morning bus to work filled Yogan with energy. He bounced his leg without pause, as if he were once again balancing his older daughter upon his knee.

“Yes, yes, I have news,” Yogan said. Now he was whispering. “But we’ll have to talk later, O.K.? I’m on the bus. I can’t talk freely.”

Beyond Roshni, the cry of his infant child erupted like a shard of lightning. He jerked his phone away from his ear for a moment, then brought it back. His daughter’s voice—already hearty and strong.

“You can’t talk freely? Listen to what I have to deal with! I don’t care if all your friends are jealous. I’ve been waiting six full months for your news!”

“Roshni, please, my jaan. Six months is nothing.”

“Six months is nothing? Wait until you see your daughter and you find how little she looks like you!”

Yogan leaned his forehead against the window; he didn’t want the man sitting next to him to witness his pleasure. “So you’ve been naughty with someone else, have you?”

“Don’t start with me now,” Roshni said. “I haven’t even had my tea. Call me later, or else I’ll have to call my new men. Men, you understand? More than one!”

“You deserve nothing less.”

“You don’t know how your oldest child is eating my brains asking for news. But don’t worry, I’ll tell her that her father is a little social butterfly who is afraid of spreading his own good fortune.”

With a laugh, he said, “Maybe I won’t tell you then.”

“Don’t tell! I’ll find another husband! I have so much time to myself these days!”

“And you should spend it wisely. With me, well, you just let your parents decide.”

“Fine, I’m putting up posters to advertise my freedom then. This time, I’ll have a love marriage.”

“Nobody too handsome, O.K.? Two beautiful faces make an ugly duckling.”

Yogan hadn’t told anyone his good news yet, not even Samar. There seemed to be much, these days, that they kept from each other.

No longer did Yogan have any use for his mustard-yellow construction hat, though he walked out of the accommodations with it under his arm each morning. From where the bus dropped off the men, Yogan hailed a taxi to the metro station, then rode the train to a shopping mall at the center of Dubai—a sprawling, bluish structure, which housed the ice rink that Yogan had been contracted to build a year ago. At home in Lucknow, he had helped build football and cricket fields before moving up to glossy hotels and office buildings. Buildings paid more, but Yogan had been happier working on the sporting fields, seeing the skinny young boys swinging wooden bats, sauntering onto freshly rolled grass, adrenaline already running through them. Yogan and his brothers had had to make do with the frequently soggy pastures behind their house. When they ran to retrieve a lost ball, they were guaranteed to feel the splash of mud across their smooth calves. The splattering sound of a bare foot against wet earth was a pleasure Yogan would never forget. When he returned home, his mother would exhale decisively, ordering him to pour water over his legs before coming inside. What had then been an annoyance seemed now an ecstasy—the cold well water licking at his bony knees, sending rivulets of red dirt worming down to the ground around his toes.

Building an ice rink was different from installing a sports field, but the spirit behind it was similar, Yogan thought. He’d been part of the team that had laid the tarp and the ice mat, and opened the water supply to fill the rink. He had checked that the pink antifreeze had made its way through every single tube of the ice mat, a moving wonder that had reminded him of the disco floor he and Roshni had once danced on before their children were born, their arms daringly clasped around each other’s waists.

To make the ice, the men had used ninety thousand litres of water, which felt like more than he’d used in the entire duration of his childhood. The water Yogan had known growing up was trickling, soft, and unalarming, except for the seasonal rains that required his parents’ roof to be re-thatched. What he saw at the ice rink, in comparison, was the water of stories, of cinema. The blast came from a hole twice the size of Yogan’s head, with enough force to drown an encroaching army. As the water exploded out of the pipe, Yogan gave a shocked giggle that swept among the other men, some of whom cheered and clapped, while others quietly removed their hard hats and held them in their hands. Yogan felt as if he had seen a waterfall, the Swiss Alps, all those stills of Europe that were used as backdrops for the best romantic numbers. As he conjured these pictures, he closed his eyes to enjoy the delicate cold spray that hovered above the torrent.

The rink was completed almost three months ahead of schedule. Because the men were being let go on short notice, an opportunity of further employment was communicated through the rink supervisor. If a handful of men wanted to stay on as skating instructors, they would be trained for free.

In a locker room behind the rink, Yogan donned a pair of formal black trousers, a white dress shirt with a slight tea stain on the collar, and a shiny, satin vest with three pearlescent buttons down the middle. He sprayed himself with a strong oud cologne he’d bought on sale at the supermarket, then rolled on his thick woolen socks. The skates he’d been given were made of pristine, stiff leather; the blades were sharpened for him when he hung them up at the end of each week. Now he tottered across the rubber mat of the back room, and in a single, practiced gesture, he was off gliding across the fresh morning ice.

For a long time, like everyone in his family, Yogan had believed in fate, the old idea that the same souls were reincarnated into the same families in order to relive past mistakes, at least until one lucky fool broke the spell. When he was growing up, his mother had often said that she was living out the life of her own mother, so it was no coincidence that she’d encountered the same hardships—a lame foot, an abusive mother-in-law, a savage bout of cancer that would surely see her to the end. Because she had predicted her life so accurately, Yogan and his siblings were convinced that she was clairvoyant, and, in moments of privacy, they would fearfully ask her whether she could tell them anything about their futures. Her mood usually changed at this question, as if the idea of her sons outliving her, loving women and children of their own, meant that her life would be shortened. Bitterly, she would toss them futures so bleak and unappealing that, more than once, Yogan had to talk his youngest brother out of hanging himself.

“You’ll live your father’s life, what else?” his mother would start. “You’ll owe every neighbor a debt and spend every holy day at a brothel. What? Did you think you were going to become a king?” She laughed at the audacity suggested by her own question, then opened her arms to welcome her son, whom only she could comfort, for it was she who had opened the wound to begin with.

Yogan, too, had believed some of her predictions. How could his life turn out any different than his father’s? Those first few years with Roshni, he had kept himself at a comfortable and loveless distance, in order to protect both of them from whatever qualities he might or might not have inherited from his father. But Yogan had become living proof that his mother’s predictions were bullshit. Yogan, who now spent his daylight hours gliding across ice, teaching children and adults to spin like dancers—he had not grown up to resemble anyone he knew.

“Morning, gentlemen,” the instructor, Felix, had said at the start of each training session.

He spoke only in English, and Yogan had been surprised at how quickly he was able to catch on. “What do we say, chaps? Slow and steady is the way of the coward.” Felix had held his trainees’ hands as he guided them across the rink. He’d skate backward, observing every shudder and slip of Yogan’s inexperienced ankles. “Gliding, you’re just gliding,” Felix would coax, and Yogan, holding Felix’s hands, found the courage to move his hips forward, one and then the other. “Now back on your own,” Felix would say, trailing at a slight distance.

Arms raised in caution, Yogan had imagined that he was learning to skate just as his younger daughter would soon learn to walk. Every time he’d fall, every time another man’s bladed boot slid within an inch of Yogan’s fingertips or earlobe, he thought of his daughter’s waddling footsteps, the many tumbles she would take, and he believed that this vision of the child he had yet to hold in his arms somehow kept him lucky. He’d stand and dust the frost off his backside, and, with the muzzy picture of her in his mind, set off with more and more force, until he was able to make it from one end of the rink to the other without anybody’s support.

Now Yogan skated in an elegant, sinewy line around the rink, something his father never could have dreamed of, and he understood that he had been keeping his success to himself because there was no conceivable way to explain any of it.

“Morning, Yogs,” Felix said as Yogan swished past him.

“Good morning, sir,” Yogan said in English.

“You tell your wife yet?”

“No, sir,” Yogan grinned. “I am waiting.”

“You tell her soon, all right? Don’t let the lady get away.”

He had meant to tell his wife earlier that day: with his raise, he had managed to arrange a work visa for Roshni, who would be able to join him with their two daughters within the next few months. When they arrived, Yogan would move out of the accommodations and into an apartment on the other side of the city, in Karama. He would once again share a bed with his wife, their daughters in cots beside them.

“Yes, sir,” Yogan said. Out of respect, he had turned around so that he was facing Felix as they spoke. Now it was Yogan who skated backward, scanning the rink for anyone who needed his help.

Later that week, Yogan once again woke to the sound of a swat, but this time it was his own hand that was stinging. He sat up quickly and with little confusion; Samar wanted to know if Yogan would fan him.

Yogan found and unfolded the sodden newspaper they kept between their mattress and the bed frame. Leaning over Samar, Yogan saw that he was wide awake. He placed a palm on Samar’s forehead to indicate something he wasn’t sure how else to convey—his affection, or his willingness to listen.

“Will you tell me now what happened to you?” Yogan asked.

“Just let me sleep,” Samar said.

“Listen, I have something to tell you, too.”

“I need three lakhs,” Samar said. “Do you have that?”

Yogan laughed at the figure. It was about what Samar would make in a year. “What do you need that for?” He accommodated his own arm under the warmth of Samar’s neck in order to fan him more comfortably. Again, Samar went silent; he wore a calm expression that told Yogan he was not exaggerating. Then Yogan put down the newspaper and used his free hand to turn Samar’s face toward his own. “Are you sick? Do you need to pay for medicine?”

“It would be better if I was,” Samar said.

“You’re going mad without Chanda or what? Your moon’s been hidden.”

At the sound of her name, something between them seemed to crack. Samar shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands. His voice lowered in shame or remorse, he began to speak.

There had been an issue with the contract he’d signed, he said. He hadn’t read it. The contract was typed in English with an Arabic translation stapled to the back. Only when his most recent paycheck was withheld had Samar called the recruiting agency to complain and discovered what the conditions of his employment really were:

According to this contract, the EMPLOYEE (“SAMAR BOBAL”) accepts the terms of the EMPLOYER/SPONSOR (“AL KHATIB AND BROWN CONSTRUCTION LLC”) as put forth by the Recruiting Agency (“SILVER HAWK RECRUITING”) that the EMPLOYEE agrees to pay the Recruiting Agency a non-refundable fee of Three Lakh Rupees (Rs. 300,000) as facilitated through a standard loan by the Recruiting Agency in exchange for employment and visa services.

In the mail, they had sent him a version in Hindi that he had read so many times he had it memorized.

What the woman had made clear to Samar over the phone was that the recruiting agency had neglected to charge him for his loan over the past year. From now on, they would withhold his salary until he earned out the cost of his loan. They had no answer for how long this would take—the math was Samar’s to do.

“I’m a dead man,” Samar said.

The air of hope seeped out of Yogan. “Run away, then,” he said. “Take a flight back tomorrow. How will they find you?” He was trying to sound practical, unworried, but his voice broke.

“I don’t have my passport,” Samar said. He turned away, and Yogan could think of nothing to do but pick up his newspaper and wave it rapidly over Samar’s neck.

“Everything I made,” Samar said, “I’ve sent home. I have nothing on me. I’ve barely eaten today, man.”

Yogan started to give Samar what he could. A Lucknowi man he had befriended worked at the coffee shop near the ice rink and would give him sandwiches and airy bags of potato chips for free. At the end of the day, Yogan would carry these items home in his hard hat and stash them in their top bunk, along with whatever else he could spare: a spotted banana, a Tetra Pak of strawberry milk, a sleeve of Parle-G biscuits.

There were others like Samar in the city—trapped men, men who had signed the wrong papers, men who’d walked into cool roadside offices with the same idea as Yogan but emerged with a different fate. There were others in the accommodations, too, and everyone chipped in what they could to keep these men afloat.

With morning came the sound of men unrolling their carpets for prayer, the clang of steel tumblers of tea and coffee, and, through the blinds, the harsh orange glow of the day. Someone in the room always shared his cup of tea with Samar, who sat alone by the window, picking at his skin, trying and failing to phone Chanda, who had stopped answering his calls once she heard about his situation. Sometimes Samar would leave her soft, pleading monologues as voice mail: “How can your brothers say I’m a fool? I came here for you. Everything was for you.”

Later, as the men lined up for the buses that took them to their respective workplaces, Yogan squinted into the raw white light to follow the shape of Samar’s body as it approached the doors of his bus. What did he expect to see? A sign of endurance? Resolve? There was just the tall, skinny hook of his friend, thinner now than he’d ever been, his shoulders slumped, getting on the bus with a full water bottle in hand, the bright shine of his shaved scalp replaced by a thick mop of black hair.

Yogan remembered one of their first nights in the city, when the men in the room had jousted and jabbed at one another, laughing until their voices wavered with sleep, and then fell, one by one, to silence. Yogan and Samar were the last two awake, and talked late into the night about things Yogan could no longer recall, though he did remember the man on the lower bunk issuing a weak punch to their mattress at some point, urging them to go to sleep.

“Have you found some new boyfriends, then?” Yogan asked. “I’ve been thinking about you. You and your harem.”

“What dirty thoughts you think!” Roshni said. “Thank God your youngest daughter has another father.”

“He can also come. Tell him to pack his suitcase.”

“Why did you call me?”

“I’m just missing you!”

“Missing me? Why don’t you use your brain for something better!”

“What could be better than thinking of my beautiful wife?”

Yogan was full of happiness. Earlier that morning, he had selected the apartment they would move into, a one-room flat with enough space for all four of them and their small accumulation of objects. The bathroom had a pristine white tub that looked as if it had never been used before. Above the tub was a small window of pebbled glass that gave the ceramic sink a flickering shimmer. It was agonizing to hold all this in his mind, Yogan thought, to have to wait to share it with his wife.

He was skating along the side of the rink, his phone back in his pocket. He had called his wife to share this dart of anticipation, this pulsing in his jaw. Now he slowed his stride and watched a child with the same dark complexion as his older daughter gain confidence in her movements. The girl glided on jaggedly in a pair of purple skates, with Yogan following some distance behind. He gave her space until she began to skid, and then he happily skated over to ask if she needed help.

“Can you stay close?” the girl said in English. He continued to skate alongside her, in case she lost her footing again.

Most afternoons passed this way. Yogan skated the length of the rink, stopping whenever a child seemed to be attempting a particularly risky move, full of speed and reckless bravery. He’d wait, hoping, always hoping, that the child would pull it off and then try again.

He found it strange to see so many people who looked like him on the ice. People whose countries were rarely cold, people who had never seen a world caked in real winter. How brave they were to try to balance on two blades as thin as the tips of pencils, pushing off from the sides, hands outstretched for balance, their panicked eyes searching for a groove in the ice they could use, then flashing skyward to catch the glance of a proud mother or father watching from the stands. Look at my child, these parents would think. My child is doing the impossible. My child is dancing on ice in the middle of the desert.

He often imagined his daughters skating, their pleated skirts wrapping around them as they spun. For them, it would be as easy as walking on land, he thought. It was their inheritance after all, their father’s fate. But skating would not be a career for them. He would not allow that. It would be only a supplementary detail on applications, something that would win them admission into exclusive, wintry places. For once, he wished that all he’d believed about fate was true, for it would mean that his daughters would inherit his luck, that it would take them to far-off lands and give them impossible chances.

After his shift, Yogan changed into a T-shirt and new jeans that were faded and fashionably ripped at the knees, and took the metro to the Mall of the Emirates. A sensor pinged as Yogan stepped onto the shiny marble floor of the store. The man from Kabul sat behind a brightly lit display of gold and diamond jewelry, dressed in a crisp white shirt and sand-colored pants. The men in the accommodations had started referring to him as King Kabul, KK for short. This was because KK had recently chronicled the full story of his ascent on his YouTube channel.

He had first moved to Dubai to work construction, as they all had. Soon after, he was hired as a personal driver for one of his employers. When his employer began trusting him to pick up orders and mail confidential paperwork, he was given a laptop, a magical thing. A year later, having proved himself, King Kabul was instated as the general manager of the employer’s family jewelry store. These days, he spent each Eid with his employer’s family, eating meat and drinking sugary sherbet from the family’s expensive and fragile china. But the best part of all that had happened, KK had told the camera, was that he had been able to bring his family to the city. KK’s wife now worked as a cook for his employer’s family, who paid full tuition for his son to attend a rigorous international school.

“Look at you, brother,” Yogan said to KK now, his nervous hand flat on the cold display table. “I don’t want to invite the evil eye, but I need to tell someone. My Roshni is coming here, too.”

KK pointed at an amulet of a blue-and-white eyeball above the door of the shop. “There’s no evil eye here. Your good fortune is my good fortune. How old are your daughters? Maybe they can meet my son, Abas.”

“One is three. The other will be one soon.” Yogan inched his phone out of his pocket to show KK one of the photographs Roshni had sent. A selfie, with his youngest daughter sleeping in the crook of her elbow, swaddled in a pink blanket. “I hope we can put them in good schools,” Yogan said. “Like Abas.”

“There’s no end to what we hope,” KK said. He added that he and his wife had recently started thinking about sending Abas abroad for college. The boy was only twelve—he still had time to decide—but KK would need to begin saving, in case his employer became unable to sponsor Abas’s education. KK had heard of other children at his son’s school getting scholarships for colleges in London and America. “Imagine,” KK said.

“Inshallah,” Yogan said.

Behind the man from Kabul, a display case of gold and silver chains gave off small flashes of starlight.

“Hey, how much?” Yogan asked, pointing at one.

KK keyed open the glass case and held a delicate gold chain between his thumb and middle finger. From under the counter, he brought out a dark velvet tray, upon which he laid the chain gently, as if it were worth millions. Yogan touched the smooth gold clasp with the tip of his index finger; the metal was still warm from the powerful display light.

“When you’re ready,” KK said, “I’ll give you a discount. But not now. For now, you save all your change. There are lots of expenses coming for you.”

Yogan returned home to the accommodations that night a little dazed. He wanted to call Roshni again and tell her about KK’s hopes. He imagined that she would laugh, then fling an insult or two in his direction. “Abroad this, abroad that, it’s a mania these days,” she’d say. “If my girls are that smart, let them be smart near their mother. Why should I send them away?”

But she wouldn’t stay angry for long. After a moment, she would admit her own secret hopes. “Do you think if the girls go, we’ll ever get to visit?”

These days, no matter what Roshni was saying, the sound of her voice made Yogan part his lips in anticipation. How different this felt from his first few months in the city, when he had avoided her calls. Back then, the men had lined up with their phones and chargers at the two available outlets, some crying discreetly, others saying quick, important things like bank-account access codes and routing numbers, before cutting to the bye-bye.

Without fail, Samar had called Chanda each night before she went to sleep.

“Did you braid your hair?” he would ask her, and, if she said yes, it meant that she would be sleeping soon, and, if she said no, it meant that she could talk for another ten minutes.

The men had grown used to hearing Samar’s romantic conversations before bed. Sweetie, pinkie, and darling—all those sugary monikers that followed on the heels of “hello.” When the outpouring of such terms stopped, the men had noticed that, too.

“Where’s our Romeo these days?” they teased.

Four months had passed since Samar had learned about his debt. The men no longer mocked him; they were anxious to know if Chanda had responded to any of the hundreds of messages Samar had left her.

That night, as Yogan scrolled through his phone, another man approached Samar, who was sitting on the floor, gently peeling a banana. “Heard anything, or no? About Chanda?” the man asked.

Samar looked up and smiled a little crazily. “Don’t talk to me about that whore,” he said.

The following night, Samar returned from work and climbed straight up to his bunk without food or a shower.

Yogan came in from his own shower shortly after. “At least change into something clean,” he said. “I also have to sleep in that bed.”

Samar gave no response, only a kind of whimper that must have escaped accidentally.

“You want something to eat?”

Samar didn’t answer, but the other man in the room, hearing the question, looked at Yogan as if he were an idiot, as if he’d asked a fish if it wanted to swim.

Yogan went downstairs to the common kitchen with some cash in his pocket. He found one of the men he knew heating a bowl of lumpy yellow daal and a frozen paratha in the microwave. The man watched as Yogan counted out his asking price and placed the bills on the countertop. Only once the cash was secured in the man’s pocket did he hand over his warm plate of food.

In the room, the other men moved in silence as Yogan sat beside Samar on their bed, the plate in his hands. “Eat something,” he said. With his free hand, he traced the rope of Samar’s spine protruding from under his damp T-shirt.

“Did something happen?” Yogan asked. A question for anyone in the room.

“Nothing,” another man answered. “He’s just being dramatic.”

Then Samar sat up. His eyes were webbed with strawberry capillaries.

“How are you always home so early?” he asked Yogan. “Did you get fired, or what?”

“You should eat,” Yogan said.

Samar looked down at Yogan’s feet, on which he wore a pair of bright-red chappals. “Where did you buy those? Are they real Nikes?”

Yogan’s instinct was to jump off their bed and kick his slippers into the darkness under the bottom bunk. Just then, the plate of food, which he had rested on the bed beside Samar, went flying to the floor, the daal splattering across the linoleum.

“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Samar said. He held his own wrist, as if to discipline it. Then he eased himself onto the floor and began scooping the hot food into his cupped hands. His eyes had gone small and dark with tears, and he brought the inside of his elbow to dab at his wet nose.

A wave of misery and unease passed over the men, who regarded one another. Yogan crossed over to where Samar was crouched and placed a hand on his back. “Leave it,” he said, offering him a bath rag.

The other men began to collect the broken shards of the plate.

When Samar’s voice finally came, it was thick with phlegm. “Her brothers found someone to void our marriage. She’s marrying someone else,” he said.

“Shit.” It was all Yogan could say. He opened his arms for Samar to collapse into.

The metro ran mainly aboveground, but it was different from the trains in India because it did not rattle or jostle or violently assert itself. Rather, it slid to its stop. The doors opened with a gush of cool, sweetly scented air, and most of the seats inside shone in want of a patron. The train re-started with the rush of an airplane taking off, and within seconds it was speeding above the roads on cement beams tall enough to allow a panoramic view of the city. The number of skyscrapers had doubled since Yogan and Samar had first arrived in Dubai, almost two years earlier. Yogan had heard the other men saying that the towers were getting taller and more complex, and as he considered these rising obelisks of the future he thought of them not as a builder, evaluating materials and weight distribution, but as a father, anticipating the wonder of his daughters. Far beyond the skyscrapers, Yogan could see the still unfinished sporting stadium that Samar and others were working on. It was shaped like a disk, a silver mound.

It was National Day, a rare day off for all the men. Yogan was sitting beside Samar on the metro. It had been ages since he had seen Samar in his everyday clothes, and he noticed how the T-shirt his friend wore hung off his shoulders and neck.

When they’d first arrived in the station, Samar had seemed overcome with awe. He had never been inside a metro station in Dubai and couldn’t grasp how to read the digital maps that flashed on large screens above them. It was then that Yogan had admitted that he’d used the train before.

The day out was Yogan’s treat—an attempt to inject some life back into his friend, who hadn’t spoken to him since the news of Chanda’s engagement, other than to convey blank thanks for his rare acceptance of a nighttime meal.

Yogan also had to deliver his own news: he was moving out the following week.

At the mall, Yogan led Samar toward the sandwich shop. “Let’s have something? I’m hungry” was how he put it. Samar nodded his head thinly, as if he were doing Yogan a favor by agreeing to eat.

They ordered swarthy, buttered paninis full of ripe tomatoes and melted mozzarella. To Yogan’s surprise, Samar had an appetite. He appeared windswept by the ebullience of the mall, whipping his head left and right to examine the surrounding shop windows with their pedestals and handbags and slender, faceless mannequins.

“You’ve come here before?” Samar asked.

“This is what I wanted to tell you,” Yogan began.

He led the way to the ice rink, where the jaunty receptionist recognized him and allowed him access to the back room to get his skates. She handed Samar a pair of skates while Yogan paid for their day passes.

If Samar was confused, he did not show it. He had taken on, instead, the buoyant air of a dazzled child. “You want me to wear these?” he said, laughing. “I’m going to break my legs!”

“I’ll help you,” Yogan said. He already had his own skates knotted tight.

Yogan went down on his knees to fit Samar’s feet inside the skates, pulling at the laces to insure that his ankles were well secured. As he tied the knots, he explained that he’d been offered a job as a skater. He told Samar about the apartment in Karama.

Samar gave Yogan’s shoulder a brotherly punch, and said, laughing, “You bastard! This is your job?”

The laughter filled Yogan with relief. Holding his friend’s hand, Yogan ushered Samar onto the ice. Yogan suggested that he hold on to the side barriers, but Samar remained tethered to him, their damp fingers intertwined. The movements did not seem to come easily to Samar; he lifted his feet one at a time, as if he were marching. When they gained some speed, a wild, coy look appeared on his face.

“Try to lead with your hips,” Yogan said. “Let me show you.” He guided Samar to the barrier and pushed off alone, pointing down at his feet so Samar could understand what he meant.

“Do it again. Let me watch you,” Samar said when he returned. He was grinning. “Do you know any tricks?”

Again Yogan pushed off, swerving past the children and the teen-agers on the ice as Samar whistled at him from the side of the rink. “Look at this hero!” Samar called.

As Yogan skated, the chorus of an old Bollywood song began to ring in his pocket. Knowing that it was Roshni calling for their afternoon chat, he sent the call quickly to voice mail. Each time he heard that ringtone during this time of his life, he remembered how he and his siblings used to sit in front of the television with unbreakable focus, watching the finale of the movie in which the song featured. It was a declaration-of-love song, the hero and the heroine in their best clothes, dancing at the helm of a choreographed cast with clinking bangles and shimmying bellies. Finally, they were no longer bashful and had confessed their affection, which was too vast to convey in dialogue; it had to be set to music. Yogan remembered the great smile that Saif Ali Khan had worn as he danced. He had understood something about that smile even as a child. Where Yogan came from—a village outside Lucknow where sons were still preferred to daughters, most marriages were arranged, and a man out of work for a single week could render a family utterly damned—a dance number like that, in which the hero follows a girl in a shimmering blue lehenga, telling her that she looks like a piece of the moon, proved that somewhere in the world there was romance. It made life seem bearable.

Later, when Yogan looked back on this day with Samar, it was this song that he remembered, this song which became, over the years, a kind of engine for him. It unstuck him from himself when he needed it to, buoying him forward when he hesitated. That day at the rink he was moving inside a fantasy. In five days, his wife and his daughters would land in Dubai. In five days, he would hold his wife’s waist between his palms. He would cup the soft head of his new daughter, make a show of searching her face for traces of himself. It was Roshni that Yogan was thinking of that day with Samar, Roshni he imagined when their fingers were intertwined.

“Let me try,” Samar said when Yogan returned to him.

He made a few unsteady strides, his hands in front of him for protection, then gained confidence, his movements nascent but full of speed. Then Samar leaned back to avoid crashing into someone, and Yogan knew before it happened that he would correct himself by tilting too far forward too quickly, which would cause him to lose his footing. He watched his friend fall onto his knees; with his palms, he kept his body from hitting the ice.

Yogan skated over. Samar appeared more subdued than he had earlier, perhaps a little embarrassed. Yogan offered his hands to pull Samar up, and Samar took them awkwardly. He sent a crystalline wad of spit to the side.

“Why did you bring me here?” Samar asked. “To show off?”

“Come on, bhai,” Yogan said, urging him to the side of the rink.

“You want to watch me hurt myself so you can feel good?”

Yogan felt Samar’s hands grab his collar, and then he knew to anticipate the approach of knuckles, which flashed by his cheek like a pink ribbon, narrowly avoiding impact. Yogan glided backward to catch himself, one of his hands on his cheek, which had grown warm with shame. Then he heard a whistle that he recognized as the sound of his boss approaching. Yogan put up both his hands, as if in surrender. “There is no problem here, Felix,” he said in English. “This is my good friend. We are enjoying on our holiday.”

“I’m going to have to ask your good friend to get off the ice,” Felix said.

On the way home, Samar rested his head on Yogan’s shoulder. On the open plain of Samar’s neck, the skin appeared to have been shaved carelessly; there was a thin scabbed line across his Adam’s apple. Yogan lightly tapped his fingers against the healing skin, if only to show that he’d noticed it.

“You’re going to have to take care of yourself,” Yogan said. “When I’m gone, you’ll need to become close to someone else who can bring you food.”

“I’ll handle it,” Samar said.

“I’ll visit you. Every Sunday. Don’t forget.”

“Can you give me some money before you go? To tide me over until I find someone else?”

Yogan had prepared for this question, and also for its answer. Still, his throat swelled painfully, and he waited for the taut feeling to pass. Quietly, he managed to give his response: “I need the money for my girls. My oldest needs a school uniform. She needs textbooks.”

“I’ll manage,” Samar said.

He pointed at Yogan’s lap to ask whether he could use it to rest, and Yogan, with an open palm ready to catch his friend’s head, said, “Come.”

Some months after Yogan moved out, Samar disappeared from the accommodations one day, like a frame cut out of a movie. He didn’t get on the bus to the construction site. He wasn’t in his bunk when the other men came back.

The local news rarely picked up such a story; you had to dream of the dead, then wake up with a premonition. A text message received late at night, read over and over in the morning, would confirm what had happened. A young man had fallen—or jumped—in front of an oncoming train.

He had been only twenty-seven. His hands and feet were always colder than the rest of him, Yogan remembered, despite the incessant heat of those days. In bed, Yogan used to warm Samar’s rawboned fingers with his own, teasing him for his poor circulation.

There were no last rites; a ceremony would have been too expensive. No one went to claim the body. Samar’s clothes, his razor, his smartphone, and his charger were distributed among the men in the room. And, as for them, what could they do but line up for the morning bus, letting their thoughts wander, until someone issued an order, or asked sweetly, through the phone, what was new and had they eaten? ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6945786c7e37d02ed9be36dc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Title_helmet.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 13:57:10.639929

The Court’s order and three-page opinion establishes important limits on presidential authority to federalize state National Guard units under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, with implications extending far beyond the Chicago case.

The decision blocks the Trump administration from ordering the state-based military force to the Chicago area, where an immigration crackdown led to thousands of arrests and confrontations between residents and federal agents. State governors who have obtained similar injunctions in California, Oregon, and Illinois now have significant Supreme Court precedent supporting their objections to federal Guard activations.

Background: Presidential Call-Up of State Guard Units

On October 4, 2025, President Trump called 300 members of the Illinois National Guard into active federal service to protect federal personnel and property in and near Chicago. The following day, he called up the Texas National Guard for similar purposes. Both activations were executed under 10 U.S.C. Section 12406(3), which empowers the President to federalize members of the Guard if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The key legal question: What does “regular forces” mean? The administration argued it referred to civilian federal agencies like ICE or the Federal Protective Service. Illinois and other states argued it meant U.S. military forces, triggering additional constitutional constraints under the Posse Comitatus Act.

The Posse Comitatus Act: Military Execution of Civilian Laws

The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, as amended, provides: “Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”

This law was passed after Reconstruction to prevent federal military intervention in civilian law enforcement. As the Brennan Center for Justice explains, when National Guard are called into federal service, “they become part of the federal armed forces, which means they are bound by the Posse Comitatus Act until they are returned to state control.”

Congress in November 2018 issued a report: “The Posse Comitatus Act and Related Matters: The Use of the Military to Execute Civilian Law.”

“Case law indicates that ‘execution of the law’ in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act occurs (a) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to an organ of civil government, or (b) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian government. Questions concerning the act’s application arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police. At least in this context, the courts have held that, absent a recognized exception, the Posse Comitatus Act is violated when (1) civilian law enforcement officials make ‘direct active use’ of military investigators; or (2) the use of the military ‘pervades the activities’ of the civilian officials; or (3) the military is used so as to subject ‘citizens to the exercise of military power which was regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.’ The act is not violated when the Armed Forces conduct activities for a military purpose.”

Supreme Court Majority Opinion

The Court’s 6-3 decision in Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. v. Illinois, et al. was issued on the emergency docket. The majority concluded:

“We conclude that the term ‘regular forces’ in Section 12406(3) likely refers to the regular forces of the United States military. This interpretation means that to call the Guard into active federal service under Section 12406(3), the President must be ‘unable’ with the regular military ‘to execute the laws of the United States.’ Because the statute requires an assessment of the military’s ability to execute the laws, it likely applies only where the military could legally execute the laws. Such circumstances are exceptional: Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the military is prohibited from ‘executing the laws’ ‘except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.’ So before the President can federalize the Guard under Section 12406(3), he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be ‘unable’ with those forces to perform that function.”

Practical Impact of the Ruling

The Court’s interpretation creates a two-step test for federalizing the National Guard under Section 12406(3):

First, the President must have statutory or constitutional authority to use regular military forces to execute the laws in question

Second, even with such authority, the President must be “unable” with regular military forces to perform that function

Since the Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits military execution of civilian laws except where expressly authorized, circumstances permitting Guard federalization under this provision are “exceptional.”

Dissenting Opinion: Presidential Inherent Authority

Three dissenting Justices (Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas) urged caution. They noted that because this case was decided on the emergency docket seeking a stay of an injunction, there had not been full briefing by the parties or oral argument before the Justices. Instead, the Court on October 29 had requested only letter briefs on what Congress meant by the term “regular forces.”

Justice Alito wrote: “On top of all this, the Court fails to explain why the President’s inherent constitutional authority to protect federal officers and property is not sufficient to justify the use of National Guard members in the relevant area for precisely that purpose.”

Justice Gorsuch emphasized procedural concerns: “Under these circumstances, caution seems to me key, and I would decide this application narrowly, based only on those few arguments the parties preserved and the evidentiary record as it stands.”

National Guard Activations: Understanding the Three Types

National Guard members serve under a dual-enlistment structure with three different active operational statuses:

State Active Duty: Guard members serve under state authority, typically for state emergencies like natural disasters or civil disturbances. The governor maintains command and control.

Title 32 Federal Active Duty: Guard members remain under state command but are federally funded. This status has been used for disaster relief, border security operations, airport security after September 11, and COVID-19 response efforts. Guard members in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act restrictions.

Title 10 Federal Active Duty: Guard members are federalized and come under direct federal command. In this status, they are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act and generally prohibited from domestic law enforcement activities.

The Supreme Court’s December 23 decision addresses Title 10 activations and establishes significant constraints on presidential authority to federalize state Guard units for domestic operations.

Other Guard Deployments and Legal Challenges

D.C. Circuit Ruling on Title 32 Deployment

The National Guard in the District of Columbia, along with State Guards from South Carolina, West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, and South Dakota, have operated since August 2025 under Title 32 status. On December 17, 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the U.S. Government’s stay of an injunction that had blocked these deployments.

The different treatment of Title 32 versus Title 10 deployments reflects the distinct legal frameworks: Title 32 deployments keep Guard units under state command and avoid Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, while Title 10 deployments federalize the Guard and trigger constitutional constraints on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Prior State-Level Injunctions

Before the Supreme Court’s December 23 decision, governors in California, Oregon, and Illinois had already obtained federal court injunctions prohibiting Title 10 deployment of their state guards:

December 10, 2025 – Los Angeles: A federal judge ordered Trump’s National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to end.

November 8, 2025 – Portland, Oregon: A federal judge permanently blocked Trump from deploying National Guard to Portland.

October 16, 2025 – Chicago: An appeals court upheld a federal judge’s temporary order blocking National Guard deployment in the Chicago area. This is the injunction that the Supreme Court declined to stay on December 23.

These state-level victories now have the backing of Supreme Court precedent, significantly strengthening governors’ ability to resist unwanted federalization of their Guard units.

Implications for Emergency Management and Homeland Security

Impact on State-Federal Relations

The Supreme Court’s decision reinforces principles of federalism and state sovereignty over National Guard forces. State governors retain significant authority to resist federal takeover of their Guard units absent clear statutory authority and demonstrated inability of regular military forces to accomplish the mission.

For emergency management professionals, this decision clarifies the legal framework governing National Guard availability for state emergencies and disasters. While the Guard remains available for state active duty and Title 32 missions, federal authorities face substantial legal barriers to Title 10 federalization for domestic operations.

Future Legal Developments

The Court’s December 23 order is preliminary, decided on the emergency docket without full briefing or oral argument. Three dissenting Justices emphasized the need for more careful consideration. Several paths forward exist:

The Supreme Court may accept an appeal in another case for full briefing and oral argument (requires votes of four Justices to grant certiorari)

Congress could enact clarifying legislation defining “regular forces” and conditions for Guard federalization

The administration could pursue Guard deployments under different statutory authorities, including the Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C. Sections 331-335)

Until further clarification occurs, lower federal courts must follow this opinion. As Georgetown University Professor Marty Lederman, who filed an influential amicus brief in the case, explained in a November 13 podcast, the administration’s legal defeat represents a critical oversight in reasoning about presidential authority to deploy military forces domestically.

Conclusion: Separation of Powers and Guard Federalism

The Supreme Court’s December 23 decision represents a significant check on executive authority to federalize state National Guard units. By interpreting “regular forces” to mean regular military forces rather than civilian federal agencies, the Court established that Guard federalization under Section 12406(3) requires both statutory authority to use military forces for domestic law enforcement and demonstrated inability of regular military forces to accomplish the mission.

This decision reflects longstanding constitutional principles limiting military involvement in civilian affairs, rooted in the Posse Comitatus Act’s prohibition on using military forces to execute domestic laws. While the opinion is preliminary and three Justices dissented, it provides important protection for state sovereignty and the traditional federal-state partnership in National Guard operations.

As litigation continues and potentially returns to the Supreme Court for fuller consideration, state and federal officials must navigate a complex legal landscape. The decision underscores that National Guard forces remain primarily instruments of state authority, available for federal missions through cooperative arrangements that respect constitutional constraints on military power.

Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.
Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.
“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly.
The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.","After Missouri lawmakers passed a gerrymandered congressional map this fall, opponents submitted more than 300,000 signatures seeking to force a statewide vote on whether to overturn the map. But Republican state officials say they will use the map in the meantime.

Missouri courts now appear likely to weigh in.

“If we need to continue to litigate to enforce our constitutional rights, we will,” said Richard von Glahn, a progressive activist who leads People Not Politicians, which is leading the campaign opposing the gerrymandered map.

As some states engage in an extraordinary redraw of congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, state courts may decide the fate of the new maps. President Donald Trump has pushed Republican state lawmakers to gerrymander their states’ congressional maps, prompting Democratic state lawmakers to respond in kind.

Nationwide, state judges are poised to play a pivotal role in adjudicating legal challenges to the maps, which have been drafted to maximize partisan advantage for either Republicans or Democrats, depending on the state. Maps are typically only redrawn once a decade following the census.

While some state courts have long heard map-related lawsuits, the U.S. Supreme Court has all but taken federal courts out of the business of reviewing redrawn maps this year. On Dec. 4, a majority of the court allowed Texas’ new map, which seeks to secure five more U.S. House seats for Republicans, to proceed. A federal lawsuit against California’s new gerrymandered map, drawn to favor Democrats, hasn’t reached the high court.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned majority decision voiced concern about inserting federal courts into an “active primary campaign,” though Texas’s primary election will occur in March. Critics of the court’s decision have said it effectively forecloses federal challenges to this year’s gerrymanders. The justices could also issue a decision next year that makes it more difficult to challenge maps as racially discriminatory.

State courts are taking center stage after gerrymandering opponents have spent decades encouraging them to play a more active role in policing maps that had been drawn for partisan advantage. Those efforts accelerated after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 limited the power of federal courts to block such maps.

“Basically, every one of the 50 states has something in its constitution that could be used to constrain partisan gerrymandering,” said Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.

State constitutions, which are interpreted by state supreme courts, typically have language that echoes the right to freedom of speech and association found in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Wang said. They also include a right to equal protection under the law, similar to the 14th Amendment.

Some state constitutions guarantee free and fair elections, language that doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty states have some form of a constitutional requirement for free elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

At least 10 state supreme courts have found that state courts can decide cases involving allegations of partisan gerrymandering, according to a 2024 review by the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

So far this year, California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Utah have adopted new congressional maps. New maps also appear possible in Florida, Maryland and Virginia. A handful of other states — Alabama, Louisiana, New York and North Dakota — may have to change their maps depending on the outcome of court cases.

Some of those new or potential maps could face legal obstacles. Florida, New York and Ohio all have state supreme courts that have previously found problems with partisan gerrymanders. Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.

Four state supreme courts — including in Missouri — have determined that they cannot review partisan gerrymandering claims, though state courts may still consider challenges on other grounds, such as whether the districts are compact or contiguous.

In Missouri’s case, courts could also clear the way for a referendum vote over the new map, which is intended to force out U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has represented Kansas City in Congress for the past two decades. Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional districts.

The map already faces a bevy of lawsuits, most notably over whether state officials must count some 103,000 referendum signatures gathered before the governor signed the map into law; at least 106,000 signatures are needed to send the map to voters.

Opponents of the new map have also filed lawsuits asserting the Missouri Constitution prevents redistricting without new census data and that an area of Kansas City was simultaneously placed into two separate congressional districts.

Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ decision this month (relying on an opinion from Missouri Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway) to implement the new congressional map, despite a submitted referendum petition, is expected to become the latest legal flashpoint. Opponents of the map argue it is now paused under state law.

Hoskins spokesperson Rachael Dunn said in a statement to Stateline that local election officials have until late July to verify referendum signatures — months after candidate filing ends March 31 and days before the Aug. 4 primary election. At that point, blocking the new map would be all but impossible, even if map opponents have gathered enough signatures to force a vote.

“Once signatures are all verified, the Secretary will certify the referendum based on constitutionality and verification,” Dunn wrote.

Hanaway’s office didn’t respond to questions.

Breaking out of lockstep

As federal courts limit their review of gerrymandering because of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, some state supreme courts are reluctant to wade into the issue because of a practice called “lockstepping.”

State supreme courts often interpret their state constitutions in line with — or in lockstep with — how the U.S. Supreme Court views similar language in the U.S. Constitution. Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.

Gerrymandering opponents have used a variety of arguments over the years to try to prod state supreme courts out of lockstep. They have emphasized differences in wording between state constitutions and the federal one, and provisions in state constitutions — such as the free elections requirement — not found in the U.S. Constitution.

Sometimes these arguments work — and sometimes they don’t. The North Carolina Supreme Court in 2022 ruled against partisan gerrymandering. But after two Republicans were elected as justices that fall, the court reversed itself months later.

“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly. And it’s been met with mixed success,” said Sharon Brett, a University of Kansas associate professor of law. In 2022 as litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, she unsuccessfully argued a case before the state’s high court challenging Kansas’ congressional map.

In states where legislatures draw congressional maps, some lawmakers argue that state constitutions shouldn’t be interpreted to curb legislative authority over mapmaking. Court-imposed limits amount to violations of the traditional separation of powers, they say, with the judiciary overstepping its authority to interfere in politics.

“We expect them to be nonpartisan. We expect them to be unbiased. We expect them to be fair. We expect them to read the constitution and to protect or at least respect the separation of powers,” said Utah Republican state Rep. Casey Snider, speaking of Utah courts during a floor speech earlier this month.

In Utah, state courts waded through a yearslong legal battle over whether state lawmakers must adopt a non-gerrymandered map. After the Republican-controlled legislature repealed and replaced an independent redistricting process, the Utah Supreme Court last year ruled lawmakers had violated the state constitution.

A Utah district court judge in November then adopted a congressional map that will likely lead next year to the election of a Democrat. The state’s four congressional seats are currently all held by Republicans.

“What we would like is them to redistrict based on population — fairly,” Katharine Biele, president of the League of Women Voters of Utah, said of state lawmakers.

Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the Utah legislature into special session earlier in December to respond to the judge’s decision. Lawmakers pushed back candidate filing deadlines in hopes that an appeal to the Utah Supreme Court will result in a decision overturning the judge’s adopted map.

They also passed a resolution condemning the judiciary.

Constitutional concerns

As the Indiana legislature weighed a gerrymandered map to boost Republicans this month, some lawmakers were reluctant to constrain state courts. Democrats currently hold two of the state’s nine congressional districts.

The GOP-controlled Indiana Senate voted down the map in a major setback to Trump’s national redistricting push. The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.

Indiana Republican state Sen. Greg Walker said the measure violated the state constitution, which guarantees an “inviolate” right to a jury trial in all civil cases. “In legal terms, ‘inviolate’ has the implication of being sacred, as opposed to being just a piece of the law,” Walker said on the floor.

State Sen. Mike Gaskill, a Republican who sponsored the map, said during a speech that Indiana residents would benefit from a quick process to resolve legal challenges. “Both sides, in any case, want them to be settled quickly so that they don’t cause chaos and interruptions in the elections process,” he said.

If the map had passed, opponents would have likely attacked the measure using a provision of the Indiana Constitution that requires “free and equal” elections.",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=61685337&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C60%2C0%2C60,N,,2025-12-28 11:12:14.030189

Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006.
My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business.
“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said.","On Dec. 10, Sayyid Akbarov was studying for his final exams when he heard something that made his stomach drop:

His father, Saydullo, was detained by federal immigration officials during a visit to Philadelphia.

Saydullo Akbarov, 42, who lives near Schuylkill Haven with his wife and four children, was at a Department of Homeland Security facility for an biannual checkup that morning, his son said.

What should have been a routine visit completed over a few hours led to him being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to Sayyid, 19.

Saydullo, a native of Uzbekistan, was later moved to the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Centre County, where he remains.

Saydullo owns and operates a local trucking business, Wild Stallion LLC, which has stalled in his absence, Sayyid said.

Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006. They have raised all four of their children in the county — Sayyid, a former wrestling star at Blue Mountain High School, and his three younger sisters.

It has been a tough two weeks for the Akbarovs as they navigate life without their patriarch, whom they describe as a devoted citizen and community member.

“It’s a surprise when a complying person like that — he’s not on the run, he’s not a fugitive, he’s a business owner, complies with all the rules, has no criminal history, no record — is detained like that,” Sayyid said. “It’s surprising to see something like that happen.”

Sayyid said he and his family are discouraged because there is no legal recourse they can seek at this point. The Akbarovs were advised by a lawyer that they must wait around six months before they can take action and try to have Saydullo released, he said.

“From what the lawyer is saying, we have to wait a minimum of six months before we can reopen the case and get him out,” Sayyid said. “We don’t want to wait that long. … That’s the question we’re all asking right now — what can we do to get him out?

“We don’t want him to sit in there for six months. We’re doing everything we can. We’ve reached out to congressmen, we reached out to people to see if they can get him out, see if they can take some action on their end. We’ve talked to many lawyers, we’ve talked to people, family friends to see if they can have any pull. But unfortunately, we’ve come up short.”

Sayyid said that his father, over the past 19 years, has built a life as “a perfectly good resident who pays his taxes, clean record, no criminal history, has a business, has four kids, productive citizen and community leader.”

“In reality, he is the picture perfect American person,” Sayyid said. “ … He was not given the American dream — he earned it, worked for it — and with God’s grace, he was able to get it and fulfill the American dream. Isn’t that what this is all about? Isn’t that why people immigrate to the U.S., so they can have a better life?

“They want to take it all away. Twenty years being in the country, for nothing. They want him to start from scratch all over again, in a different country. Not only that, they want to drag a family apart. They want to drag him away from the community. His shoes are too big to fill.”

Sayyid, a sophomore track-and-field athlete at Lehigh University, said he felt overwhelmed when his mother called him on Dec. 10 to tell him about his father’s detainment. Stressed out after a rigorous semester at school — and simultaneously fighting through an illness — Sayyid was studying for his finals in a cafe in Philadelphia when he heard the news.

“When he was detained, I was thrown into the fire,” he said. “It was during finals week — I had my first final the day after he was detained. So I couldn’t concentrate on the finals, I didn’t do as well as I hoped to — and at the same time, the business needs, when he was (detained), I had to run the entire operation. At the same time while studying, visiting lawyers, prepping the paperwork, processing all this information. Just a lot to do during a small period of time.”

After he was taken into custody at the DHS facility, Saydullo was processed at a Philadelphia detention center. Officials then moved him to long-term custody at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, Sayyid said.

Saydullo is active on the board of directors at the Islamic Society of Schuylkill County. Sayyid said his father has spearheaded the construction of many important amenities there, such as a parking lot and an accessible ramp that leads directly to the prayer hall.

He said his father orchestrates many other aspects of the mosque’s operations.

“He’s not just a business owner, not just a family member, but he’s also a community leader,” Sayyid said. “We rely on him here every day. … What he built and what he contributed to this mosque is really important.”

Sayyid said he and his uncle have helped out with Wild Stallion LLC, trying to “keep it somewhat open, somewhat alive,” but he said the business is unable to operate normally and stay solvent without Saydullo.

“We’re working with lawyers to see if we can get some sort of petition going for him,” Sayyid said. “There’s little to nothing we can do legally other than wait. … I can’t run the business, I’m a student athlete. My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business. People are going to lose their jobs.”

Beyond their personal relationship, Sayyid believes his father’s livelihood and his efforts for the community are too valuable to be removed all at once, after nearly two decades of positive contributions.

“Nothing positive is being gained,” Sayyid said. “Yeah, you removed a perfectly good resident, and there’s one less immigrant in the country. But is that really a positive to society? Is that what the country really wants for people? … It just doesn’t make any sense.”

Community leader

Those who know Saydullo Akbarov describe him as a hard-working, dedicated person who can be counted on to help out his community.

“People rely on him to get things done, for help, for everything,” Sayyid said. “That’s his place in the community.”

Dr. Mohammad Masood Akbar, a local ENT, said he was “really shocked” when he heard the news about Saydullo, whom he has known for several years.

“It’s going to be a big loss for our community,” said Akbar, who serves as vice president of the Islamic Society.

Among Saydullo’s many attributes, Akbar singled out his skill as a handyman, noting he can address any sort of community or mosque-related construction project.

“He is the ideal person you could have as a friend, a family member,” he said.

Alaedin Alamari, a longtime friend of Saydullo’s, said he is missed by everyone in the community.

“He’s a really good man,” Alamari said. “He’d give a hand for everybody. You miss him here. Everybody needs him here with us.”

Zachariah Hnesh, of Pottsville, said that Saydullo’s impact extends far beyond the mosque.

“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said. “He’s helped coach youth wrestling. He’s done all these different services for the community. He’s employed local people, he’s an entrepreneur, he’s raised a beautiful family. … Just an all-around stand-up guy. He’s helped in so many different capacities.”",https://www.republicanherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RHR-L-AKBAROV-1227-0-16x9-1.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:51.686632

It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.
Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight.
Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week.","The Latest Storm Tracker Forecast from Meteorologist Kevin Appleby:

After a chilly night, the daytime hours of Sunday will be rather cloudy, but dry & uneventful. Things change quickly Sunday night after 5 PM. Very warm air will be present aloft, but sub-freezing temperatures at the surface will create an environment ripe for ice, especially in northern areas into Monday morning. We then change years with a stretch of below average temperatures.

It will be frigid overnight thanks to partly clear skies, lack of wind, and a fresh snow pack in wake of Friday evening’s snow. Lows will be in the single digits, with some subzero readings expected in the hills and mountains.

Temperatures will gradually warm Sunday. But after such a cold start, temperatures regionwide will be below freezing at the onset of precipitation Sunday evening.

What makes this winter storm unique from previous ones this season will be the abundance of warm air aloft, melting snow into rain. However, with subfreezing temperatures locked in at the surface, this rain will freeze on contact with roads, walkways, powerlines, sidewalks – you name it.

Our storm is still getting its act together over the center of the country, but it will carry with it a strong cold front that, one is passes through Monday afternoon, will increase our winds and bring in much colder air for the remainder of the forecast.

Winter Weather Advisories are up across the board for the anticipated ice, but not all advisories are created equally! Mohawk Valley-southbound, the Advisory is in effect through 4 AM, when temperatures should be above freezing. However, in the North Country, the colder air at the surface will be a bit more stubborn, so the Advisory is in effect through 10 AM. It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.

As mentioned, area-wide, this is almost entirely ice at the onset. There won’t be any sleet or any snow with this system. Temperatures will gradually warm thanks to an increasing south wind, allowing a changeover to plain rain generally form south to north.

By 6 AM Monday, the Capital Region and points south should be above freezing, with some even close to 40 degrees by then. However, sub-freezing temperatures may persist to the north. Beyond 10 AM, temperatures will be above freezing, and the rest of the daytime hours will feature scattered rain showers. Behind the cold front as temperatures at the surface and aloft plummet Monday evening and a gusty westerly wind kicks in, lake effect snow showers and flurries are expected.

Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight. Locally, I think we see a tenth of an inch or more of ice accretion. Remember, with ice, it only takes a glaze to create hazardous driving conditions! But up north, where as much as a half an inch of ice is possible, that is where there is a growing concern for power outages into Monday morning. Highest confidence in these higher ice amounts exists over much of the Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, and Saratoga Region, with some similar amounts possible within sheltered valleys of the Green Mountains in Vermont.

Temperatures should actually spike into the lower 40s Monday afternoon (mid to upper 30s in the areas with a higher ice accretion forecast), but will quickly drop Monday evening as another shot of arctic air filters in. On top of temperatures struggling to rise far above 20 degrees Tuesday afternoon, winds may gust as high as 50 MPH. That could also create for some power outages, but also keeps wind chill values in the single digits (below zero in the high spots). And, since these winds are off of the Great Lakes (specifically Lake Ontario), accumulating snow is expected, with plowable snowfall totals through Wednesday expected in parts of the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks.

The breeze eases up Wednesday, but it will remain out of the west-northwest, thus continuing lake effect snow showers and flurries. Another wave of low pressure will slide near the region late Thursday, possibly producing a quick shot of light snow. Into next weekend, it will be colder than average, but dry conditions are favored both Friday and Saturday at this time.

Cannot say the same for next Sunday as some guidance suggests another winter storm is possible – one that would have all precip types associated with it. Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week. Clouds hang around next Monday. More sun is possible by Tuesday, but that may be accompanied by colder temperatures.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2022/09/STORM-TRACKER_WEATHER-alert-snow-parking-dig-plow-3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:58.795498

Scenes this summer of a synchronized fleet of Ukrainian drones descending on a field of Russian warplanes punctuate just how far we’ve pivoted from classic artillery and infantry-based operations. It’s not only the methods that are changing, but increasingly the targets. What will come next will be clandestine, remote hacking attacks supercharged by AI and targeted (or errant) munitions that sever broadband lines and incinerate internet infrastructure. And with data center development and the internet’s reach continuing to quickly accelerate worldwide, this shift should worry us all — because the primary victims of new age digital warfare will be vast civilian populations, and the toll will be catastrophic.

One need only look at Gaza to understand just how damaging these disruptions can be. According to a report from Access Now, Gaza experienced at least 27 complete or partial internet and telecommunications outages since Israel’s assault on the territory began in October 2023. The most recent shutdown, this past September, preceded an Israeli ground invasion with tanks and infantry.

Whether due to intentional sabotage or negligence, these actions have greatly hindered emergency responses and the coordination and delivery of services and resources, including food and water for besieged Gazans.

Concerns about attacks via or against the internet aren’t isolated to active conflict zones. Seventy-five percent of Americans are concerned about the safety of the country’s internet infrastructure, and it’s not hard to understand why. In the roughly two decades that the internet has been more or less ubiquitous in the U.S., the technology has evolved from being a novelty to being critical in how we perform our work, socialize, manage our finances and stay informed.

For most of us, the idea of an internet outage is mildly panic-inducing, plunging us into an experience that feels akin to temporarily losing one of our senses. But compare that with people in countries confronted by this new era of cyber- and internet infrastructure attacks, where internet disruptions are a recurrent reality. Civilian life, if not the target, is frequently among the collateral damage.

Somewhere around 5.5 billion people, roughly 68% of the world’s population, now use the internet. That’s more than double the number from just a decade ago, with the internet essential to how contemporary society and its institutions function. It’s used by hospitals and nonprofits to deliver healthcare and social services. It’s used by the government to make commercial travel and traffic safer. It helps coordinate the byzantine supply chains that fuel our economies. It even helps monitor and upkeep our communities’ water and energy infrastructure.

Because of how central the internet is to even these most basic functions, efforts to deliberately disrupt or terminate internet access reflect clear violations of human rights. And in a growing number of cases around the world, the violations are a clear matter of life and death. Yet there has been little international response to the increasing use of attacks on internet infrastructure in regions that are embroiled in explicit and covert war.

At multiple points over the last decade, undersea cables have been deliberately severed or otherwise sabotaged by antagonist actors. Last year, two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, one linking Germany and Finland, were ruptured, presumably by Russian saboteurs. And this past March, the Peace Submarine Cable, connecting Africa, Asia and Europe, was cut, causing widespread internet outages in East Africa. No cause has been officially determined.

Last year, many Americans got a direct taste of just how much an internet blackout could affect our daily lives. A global internet outage in July 2024 caused by lapses from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, affected 26% of U.S. adults. The unintentional outage crippled financial services, delayed flights and led to disruptions of operations at hospitals and businesses across the world. So what happens when bad actors, including our own governments, intentionally, with even more precision and resources at their disposal, target our internet and threaten our ability to stay connected?

In October 2024, the Taliban instituted a broad internet shutdown in Afghanistan under the dubious pretext of addressing internet “misuse,” restoring it shortly after widespread condemnation. But this is far from the first instance of the internet being weaponized by internal forces. Following the example of Iran, Sudan, Bahrain, Egypt and Syria have cut off or suppressed internet access to stymie protesters, with varying degrees of success.

In a particularly troubling development that may signal broader trends, Russia has recently been testing a way to cut its territories off from the global internet as a way of building its own “sovereign” network — one that could allow the Kremlin to more directly surveil civilians and quash political dissent.

In 2016, the Human Rights Council of the United Nations formally declared access to the internet a human right. But like most of its pronouncements, enforceability and accountability aren’t guaranteed or widely expected. A handful of countries, each with deeply autocratic leanings — Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India — have opposed UN amendments aimed at codifying the internet as a human right.

To earnestly make internet access a human right, it’s important that we define precisely what constitutes access, having a clear focus on an internet that is reliable and sufficiently fast. For example, although 5G was widely available in Israel in 2020, the Israeli government has long denied Palestinians access to 4G service, relenting to upgrades in 2021 that still have not fully come to fruition as they should have.

We also must recognize that human rights are often linked, with one essential to others. For example, internet access is increasingly connected to the quality of one’s education, a more globally recognized and embraced human right. According to one international survey, roughly 39% of internet users use it for education or study-related purposes. Internet access is also intimately connected to the ability to engage in free speech and to work, two other vital human rights.

While these kinds of infringements may seem unlikely to come to American shores, various forms of internet throttling and indirect censorship already broadly occur in the country. Owing to ongoing Republican politicking, the U.S. is behind on ensuring net neutrality, a principle that says all internet traffic should be treated equally and not subjected to the biases and financial spoils of tiered access. According to a CNET poll, last year, 42% of U.S. adults said they experienced unreliable internet speeds or connectivity, and 63% saw their home internet prices increase.

With digital connectivity increasingly determining access to basic needs, the case for earnestly treating internet access as a human right has never been clearer. Like warfare, our understanding of human rights has to evolve with the times. This means understanding that in future warfare, victory won’t be measured just in terms of adversaries eliminated, but also by the depth of destruction of the internet infrastructure that sustains our societies.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40b6a37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F05%2Fb4b2709e442986dee23ea256f460%2Ftaiwan-undersea-cable-80958.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:42.695117

The Trump administration, in an effort to speed up deportations, is looking to renovate industrial warehouses to be used as ICE facilities, according to an article recently published by The Washington Post.

The reporting said according to plans, the warehouses, which will be situated in various cities and towns throughout the country, will hold 80,000 immigrant detainees and will ""help overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system.""

The plans outline two types of facilities: larger detention centers, which can hold between 5,000 and 10,000 beds, and smaller sites. The draft solicitation is not final and is subject to change, according to The Washington Post.

One New Hampshire town was mentioned in those plans — Merrimack. The reporting said ICE has plans for a smaller processing site in Merrimack. The exact location is still unclear.

It's also unclear just how much, if any, involvement the community had in the planning process.

What America Might Look Like With Zero Immigration

The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the foreign-born population are being felt in hospitals and soccer leagues and on Main Streets across the country, with hints of what’s to come.

Dec. 28, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ET

Across the United States, someone is missing.

One year into President Trump’s immigration crackdown, construction firms in Louisiana are scrambling to find carpenters. Hospitals in West Virginia have lost out on doctors and nurses who were planning to come from overseas. A neighborhood soccer league in Memphis cannot field enough teams because immigrant children have stopped showing up.

America is closing its doors to the world, sealing the border, squeezing the legal avenues to entry and sending new arrivals and longtime residents to the exits.

Visa fees have been jacked up, refugee admissions are almost zero and international student admissions have dropped. The rollback of temporary legal statuses granted under the Biden administration has rendered hundreds of thousands more people newly vulnerable to removal at any time. The administration says it has already expelled more than 600,000 people.

Shrinking the foreign-born population won’t happen overnight. Oxford Economics estimates that net immigration is running at about 450,000 people a year under current policies. That is well below the two million to three million a year who came in under the Biden administration. The share of the country’s population that is foreign born hit 14.8 percent in 2024, a high not seen since 1890.

But White House officials have made clear they are aiming for something closer to the immigration shutdown of the 1920s, when Congress, at the crest of a decades-long surge in nativism, barred entry of people from half of the world and brought net immigration down to zero. The share of the foreign-born population bottomed out at 4.7 percent in 1970. Stephen Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, has extolled those decades of low immigration as the last time the United States was “an undisputed global superpower.”

Whether or not restrictions will restore some of what Mr. Miller views as a midcentury idyll, there’s little doubt that major changes are in store. Immigration has woven itself so tightly through the country’s fabric — in classrooms and hospital wards, city parks and concert halls, corporate boardrooms and factory floors — that walling off the country now will profoundly alter daily life for millions of Americans.

Grocery stores and churches are quieter in immigrant neighborhoods. Fewer students show up in Los Angeles and New York City. In South Florida, Billo’s Caracas Boys, a Venezuelan orchestra, puts on an annual holiday concert where generations of families come to dance salsas and paso dobles. This year, the orchestra announced at the last minute that it was canceling the show because so many people are nervous about leaving home.

The changes will also be felt hundreds of miles from any ocean or national border, even in the snow-washed streets of Marshalltown, Iowa, a city of 28,000 about an hour’s drive northeast of Des Moines.

First Mexicans, some undocumented, came to Marshalltown in the 1990s to work at the pork processing plant. After a high-profile immigration raid there in 2006, refugees with more solid legal status arrived from Myanmar, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Now, Mexican, Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants dot the blocks around the grand, 19th-century courthouse. The population is 19 percent foreign born, and some 50 dialects are spoken in the public schools. The pews at the Spanish-language Mass at the local Catholic church overflow on Sundays, and, in 2021, a Burmese religious society built a towering statue of Buddha on the outskirts of town.

“You have more energy in the community,” said Michael Ladehoff, Marshalltown’s mayor-elect. “If you stay stagnant, and you don’t have new people coming to your community, you start aging out.”

But with President Trump’s crackdown on immigration gaining strength, local festivals are more thinly attended. Parents pull their children out of school when they hear about people being detained. The supervisor overseeing the construction of a high school sports stadium received a deportation letter, creating a conspicuous absence as the work finished up. The pork plant has let workers go as their work permits have expired.

The insecurity of each immigrant ripples into the wider community. Sergii Fedko and his wife, Tetiana, came to Marshalltown in 2023 along with five other Ukrainian families under an immigration parole program for their war-torn country.

Mr. Fedko, a power plant engineer in Ukraine, was quickly hired at a local architecture firm as a designer and draftsman. Ms. Fedko works at a day care center, where she is beloved by her charges. Their three sons are enrolled in school; the eldest excel at soccer and swimming. They bought two cars and a fixer-upper house.

New immigration policies have loosened their toehold in America. They applied for an extension well before their two-year parole ended, but the White House paused processing and changed the rules. As the weeks ticked by and they didn’t hear back, they got nervous, and decided to apply for asylum as well. In mid-December, Mr. Fedko got notice that his application for the extension had been approved, but it would require a new $1,000 fee. His wife’s application is still in limbo.

If she loses her work permit, it will add to the acute shortage of child care workers that is making it harder for American parents to go to work. Mr. Fedko’s manager, Heidi Hogan, has been doing everything she can to help. Her reasons aren’t entirely selfless; there aren’t many skilled draftsmen in the area.

“If he can’t stay with us,” Ms. Hogan said, “I’m going to have a hard time finding someone else.”

An Echo of the Past

It’s not clear yet what these changes will mean for America. But a past era of immigration crackdowns contains some lessons.

Over the country’s first century, immigration was essentially unrestricted at the federal level. This began to change in the late 1800s, with the “great wave” of immigrants fleeing political oppression or seeking work. Starting in the 1870s and over the decades that followed, Congress barred criminals, anarchists, the indigent and all Chinese laborers.

By the turn of the 20th century, anti-immigrant sentiment was rampant. The lawyer and eugenicist Madison Grant wrote in his 1916 book, “The Passing of the Great Race,” that foreign countries were taking advantage of America’s openness by unloading “the sweepings of their jails and asylums” and that the “whole tone of American life, social, moral and political has been lowered and vulgarized by them.”

Grant was consulted as an expert when Congress began crafting the Immigration Act of 1924, which, along with companion legislation, barred nearly all immigration from Asia, created the U.S. Border Patrol and established quotas from eastern and southern European countries. Net immigration — which accounts for people leaving as well as those coming in — plummeted.

Today’s language echoes that time. President Trump characterizes people from Somalia, Haiti and Afghanistan as coming from “hellholes” and accuses other countries of “emptying out their prisons and their mental institutions into the United States of America.”

The broader debate in the 1920s would be familiar to contemporary ears, too: fears about crime; anxiety about the falling fertility rates of the native born; suspicion about the politics of newcomers; hopes that restrictions would mean higher wages for U.S.-born workers; disputes about assimilation.

Today, some proponents of halting immigration — including Vice President JD Vance — argue that it would help the country absorb those who were already here, decrease competition for scarce goods like housing and strengthen job opportunities for young men who had dropped out of the work force. Reihan Salam, president of the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in his 2018 book, “Melting Pot or Civil War?,” that a large and constantly growing population of low-skilled immigrants, many living in working-class ethnic enclaves, risks creating a “permanent underclass.”

Evidence is mixed on the effect of the 1920s restrictions on assimilation. Some researchers have found that, without newcomers arriving from their home countries, immigrants were more likely to marry American-born citizens and less likely to live in ethnically homogenous neighborhoods. Other studies suggest that policies aimed at forcing assimilation backfired, strengthening the determination to maintain ethnic identities.

Regardless, the effects of that period continue to reverberate. Melissa Marinaro, who directs the Italian American Program at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, said that when people who fled Italy in the years around World War II could not join family members in the United States, they went to Australia or Canada instead.

“One hundred years later, we still have Italian American families who are split from their extended families,” she said.

The restrictions passed in the 1920s governed U.S. immigration until international competition in the Cold War, the civil rights movement and a shift in organized labor’s stance led to the end of national origins quotas in 1965.

Immigrants Make Up as Much of America as Ever

Before President Trump took office, the share of the population that was born outside the U.S. matched a historic high from 1890.

% foreign born

Although the effects of the 1924 immigration restrictions are difficult to untangle from other developments — wars, technological advancements, the baby boom — wages rose for U.S.-born workers in places affected by the immigrant restrictions. But only briefly. Employers avoided paying more by hiring workers from Mexico and Canada, countries not subject to immigration caps; American-born workers from small towns migrated to urban areas and alleviated shortages. Farms turned to automation to replace the missing labor. The coal mining industry, which was powered by immigrants now barred from entry, shrank.

And today? Construction wages have been rising, even as home building has been sluggish — a potential indication that deportations in the immigrant-heavy industry are bidding up salaries. The union representing workers in the pork processing industry sees an upside, too, even though it opposes deportations and won wage increases after President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s immigration surge.

“I will certainly bring it up at the bargaining table that the way to solve a labor shortage is to pay more money,” said Mark Lauritsen, head of the meatpacking division at the United Food and Commercial Workers Union International.

The same is true in landscaping. Immigrant crews, working outside, were an easy deportation target over the summer. Come spring, said Kim Hartmann, an executive at a Chicago-area landscaping firm, the labor force could be 10 to 20 percent smaller.

“It’s going to be much more competitive to find that individual who’s been a foreman or a supervisor and has years of experience,” Ms. Hartmann said. “We know that drives costs up.”

But there are limits to how much customers will pay for decorative shrubs, and they may opt to go without. One 2022 study examined the expulsion of tens of thousands of Mexicans from the United States in the early 1930s. Contrary to the policy’s intent, unemployment rose and wages were depressed for native-born workers, possibly because sectors that depended on immigrant labor — agriculture, construction and manufacturing — suffered so much that they contracted.

The lesson of the last period of intense restriction is that employers have an array of ways to adjust, said Leah Boustan, an economics professor at Yale who studies the history of immigration.

“The menu is other sources of labor, and machinery,” she said. “It’s not obvious that you’re going to pick the guy down the street relative to these alternatives.”

Where Hands Still Matter

Today, that menu has expanded. Companies can outsource jobs to other countries. Artificial intelligence is replacing some types of work, and other countries, like Japan, have shown the possibilities of robotics. But many services still require humans, in person.

“If you’re an obstetrician, delivering a baby right in the moment, you need hands to lay on the patient,” said David Goldberg, a vice president of Vandalia Health, a network of hospitals and medical offices in West Virginia. “It’s not the same as a banker, or someone creating code.”

Nearly a fifth of nursing positions are currently vacant in West Virginia — a state that is older, sicker and poorer than most — and the state faces a serious shortage of physicians in the coming years. The answer has been to look abroad. A third of West Virginia’s physicians graduated from medical schools overseas. Now that option is narrowing.

“We lost two cardiologists because of their concern that they wouldn’t get their visa and, if they did, that they would not be able to stay here permanently,” Mr. Goldberg said. “They went elsewhere.”

Similarly, nobody has figured out how to harvest delicate crops with machines. During the low-immigration 1970s, some crops, like green onions, disappeared from shelves or were imported instead.

“It’s not going to hop from the ground into a package without somebody’s hands being involved somewhere along the way,” said Luke Brubaker, who runs a dairy farm with his sons and a grandson in Pennsylvania. To milk cows, feed them and deliver calves, he relies on more than a dozen foreign-born workers, most of them Mexican. He is not optimistic that he will be able to replace them.

“You can put an ad in the paper,” he said. “Maybe you would have one American-born applying for that job if you need 10 people. And that’s a maybe.”

For now, Mr. Brubaker can still find staff. The surge of immigrants who entered the United States under President Biden — more than eight million people — means that many foreign-born workers are still available.

That surge helped create an anti-immigrant backlash, inflaming fears about crime and jobs. It also stung immigrants who felt they had faced higher barriers than newer ones from places like Venezuela.

“The Mexican population felt that it was not fair,” said Alfonso Medina, who owns La Carreta, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Marshalltown started by his father, a Mexican immigrant, in 2000. “Imagine you’re here for 20, 30 years contributing. And all of a sudden here comes this administration and starts letting people in right away with a permit. They felt betrayed.”

In 2024, they shifted toward Mr. Trump.

Land of Opportunity?

Dan Simpson, the chief executive of Taziki’s, a fast casual Mediterranean restaurant chain based in the Southeast, has been losing employees since the beginning of the year. These were not only dishwashers and cooks but also managers and assistant managers, who had come to the United States with advanced degrees.

While he worries about the effect on his own business, he believes that the damage could be much greater.

“If you zoom back, the bigger problem is that we’re tarnishing the brand of America,” Mr. Simpson said. Even if the United States opens up again, he said, “we’re going to need a campaign to fix the idea that America is not the land of opportunity.”

International students pay full-freight tuition that helps fund new programs and basic costs at many U.S. colleges. As international enrollment has dropped, many schools are facing budget holes.

Nearly half of the immigrants who legally came to the United States from 2018 to 2022 were college educated, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Immigrants are far more likely than U.S. citizens to start businesses; nearly half of this year’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Several studies have found a decline in the number of patents issued for U.S. inventions after the immigration laws of the 1920s.

“You have an economy that is smaller, less dynamic and less diversified,” said Exequiel Hernandez, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

In early 2025, Rayan Sadri was raising money for his artificial-intelligence start-up. In June, the Trump administration barred everyone from a list of Muslim countries, including Iran, where Mr. Sadri is from. Based in Montreal and unable to travel in the United States, Mr. Sadri could no longer easily meet potential investors and customers. Moving the company to San Francisco, as he would have liked, was not going to happen. Among other factors, the ban slowed the young company’s momentum.

“Everything for start-ups is momentum,” said Mr. Sadri, who is now going to work for another tech company in Canada.

It’s not just Silicon Valley. Small enterprises across the country have been built by and for immigrants — and been embraced by a wider community. In Marshalltown, Luisa Ortega has been putting on Mexican-style rodeos and popular music acts since 2012. In recent years, white residents have started coming, too. “They like the all-day show, they want to be able to go and dance,” she said.

‘What Is the Future?’

Over the longer term, low immigration will collide with one inexorable trend: an aging population in need of care just as fewer workers are available to provide it.

Half of the people who work at Sinai Residences, a senior living facility in Boca Raton, Fla., are immigrants. Rachel Blumberg, the chief executive, has already had to notify 38 workers from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela that they will have to go because the Trump administration ended their country’s temporary legal status. That is 9 percent of her work force.

“It was like this funeral that would never end,” she said, of those conversations. “They’re my best employees.”

Rural areas and postindustrial cities have long struggled with an exodus of the young and the growing needs of the older residents who are left behind. Many of these places have pinned their futures on immigrants.

Lancaster County, Pa., most famous for a community that has refused to assimilate — the Amish — has over the years also become home to a global marketplace. People from Myanmar now fill the pews of a Mennonite church founded in the 1700s. Scores of Congolese refugees work at local distribution centers. The county seat, Lancaster, has two Nepalese restaurants. Resettling refugees, long a mission of local Mennonites, has become central to Lancaster’s growth strategy.

Unlike most Pennsylvania counties, “Lancaster’s numbers are growing,” said Heather Valudes, the president of the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. “But that is simply because of immigrants.”

Ahmed Ahmed, 31, arrived in Lancaster when he was 3. His parents, refugees from Chad, worked as certified nursing assistants, taking care of Lancaster’s elderly; Mr. Ahmed became the manager of a local hotel and a city councilman.

He now supervises some of the immigrants who came after him, including several Cuban refugees who worked at the hotel. This summer, they learned that their temporary work permits had expired. The Haitian workers at the poultry plant learned this, too. As did the Ukrainian employees at the Walmart.

They are now stuck in limbo. The economy is closed to them, but they are unable to return home — the United States does not even allow commercial flights into Haiti. Shut out of the formal work force, some will probably move to larger cities and look for under-the-table jobs, delivering food or cleaning homes.

Mr. Ahmed was not sure what became of the Cubans he worked with. He is concerned about them, and also worried about what may lie in store for his adopted hometown.

“This is only Year 1,” he said. “What is the future?”

President Donald Trump had talked about reaching 3,000 deportations a day, but local enforcement actions here have been smaller. They have also been shrouded in secrecy, and the opacity has been one of the defining features of 2025.

Additionally, a clearer picture of the activities of Tren de Aragua emerged. This month, federal officials announced the indictment of two suspected TdA leaders in Denver on racketeering charges tied to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, money laundering and drug offenses over 14 months.

At the political front, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston appeared, alongside the mayors of Boston, Chicago and New York Mayor, in Congress to answer questions about his city’s “sanctuary” policies and response to the illegal immigration crisis, which spilled over from the southern U.S. border into America’s interior cities. The bill for Johnston’s legal defense for that March 5 hearing before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee crossed the $1 million mark this month.

Within weeks of Trump assuming office, Immigration Customs and Enforcement had partnered with the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to knock down doors and round up immigrants unlawfully residing in the U.S.

These agencies widely touted their operations on social media.

Residents at one of these raids at Cedar Run Apartments in southeast Denver near Cherry Creek, disputed that federal agents had warrants targeting “wanted drug traffickers.”

The Denver Gazette sought copies of the warrants through the Freedom of Information Act. In response, ICE provided administrative warrants that in some cases were post-dated April 3 — nearly two months after the raid. An administrative warrant is an internal document that does not carry the same force of law as one signed by a judge. It authorizes agents to make an arrest, but not forced entry.

The DEA and FBI issued what’s called “Glomar” denials, rather than release the warrants tied to local operations, a position under appeal in cases involving the DEA and FBI.

Groups like the ACLU of Colorado have challenged some of the tactics in court, arguing agents have conducted warrantless apprehensions that violate constitutional protections. A federal judge has sided with the ACLU, granting a preliminary injunction.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said ICE officials are not making “indiscriminate” stops.

“This activist ruling is a brazen effort to hamstring the Trump administration from fulfilling the President’s mandate to deport the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” McLaughlin has said.

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement engages in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically false,” McLaughlin has said, adding the ruling will “hamstring” the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, Colorado’s largest school district mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge after the administration attempted to roll back long-standing protections that limited immigration enforcement in “sensitive” locations, such as campuses.

As part of the lawsuit, Denver Public Schools Superintendent Alex Marrero claimed the ICE raids in February negatively affected attendance. Attendance data across district-run schools reviewed by The Denver Gazette suggested a more nuanced picture.

The administration’s immigration operations sparked a wave of “No Kings” demonstrations and mass immigration protests at the state Capitol that drew thousands of residents.

Meanwhile, the TdA gang remained at the forefront of news, with authorities indicting two men they alleged to have sanctioned the armed robberies of two jewelry stores in Denver. In the Joyeria El Ruby robbery, authorities said, gang members stole nearly $4 million in jewelry and gold and brutally beat several employees with a firearm.

The pair also directed the kidnapping of a young man at gunpoint in October last year in an attempt to extract $30,000 ransom that the family did not pay, according to authorities. TdA gang members cut off one of his fingers, the authorities said. One of the leaders is one of the FBI’s top 10 most wanted, with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture or conviction.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25036611528177-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:55.012616

In August, Abrego Garcia filed a motion to dismiss his federal indictment on the basis of a selective and vindictive prosecution.
In October, the court found there was a ""realistic likelihood of vindictiveness"" behind the federal charges against Abrego Garcia.
But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to.
The evidentiary hearing is slated for Jan. 28, 2026.","The federal judge overseeing the human smuggling case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has canceled an upcoming January trial.

In lieu of that proceeding, the court will hold a one-day evidentiary hearing dedicated to ferreting out whether or not the Maryland man was vindictively and selectively prosecuted by the government.

This week, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, a Barack Obama appointee, slammed the brakes on the controversial prosecution in a relatively terse four-page order – a decided victory for the father of three and an equally stinging loss for the Trump administration.

In the ruling, the judge said the evidence provided by the defense had turned the case in Abrego Garcia's favor long ago – at least on the due process issue of whether the prosecution is vindictive.

""The burden-shifting framework controls the Court's analysis,"" Crenshaw writes. ""Specifically, once a defendant establishes a prima facie showing of vindictiveness, 'a presumption arises in defendant's favor.' The Court has already found that Abrego has made such a showing, entitling him to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on why the government is prosecuting him.""

In August, Abrego Garcia filed a motion to dismiss his federal indictment on the basis of a selective and vindictive prosecution.

In October, the court found there was a ""realistic likelihood of vindictiveness"" behind the federal charges against Abrego Garcia.

The immigration lodestar's high-profile litigation is a well-known subplot of the story of the second Trump administration. Abrego Garcia was part of a summary deportation flight to a prison notorious for torture in El Salvador, but his deportation violated multiple court orders — both specific to him and general to the flight in question.

A DOJ lawyer was sacked after admitting the Trump administration's mistakes and, through a seesawing battle that has gone up the legal ladder all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and back down to various different district courts, Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States, promptly charged with unrelated crimes, and eventually released on bail before being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yet again in late September.

Now, the outcome of the case is contingent on whether the government can rebut the presumption in the defense's favor by producing ""objective, on-the-record explanations"" for the human smuggling charges, according to the court.

The judge notes the upshot, at length:

Whether the government can produce such evidence is critical, for ""[i]f the government fails to present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption, the presumption stands and the court must find that the prosecutor acted vindictively,"" leading to ""dismissal of the charges or other appropriate remedies."" However, ""[i]f the government produces evidence to rebut the presumption, the defendant must prove that the offered justification is pretextual and that actual vindictiveness has occurred.""

Crenshaw says the next step will be the evidentiary hearing – which will ""only"" turn on whether or not the government is able to rebut the presumption currently working in Abrego Garcia's favor.

""If the government can rebut that showing, the Court will revisit the government's Motion to Quash, as the burden will again shift back to Abrego to establish that the government's rationale for prosecuting him is pretextual and that his prosecution is actually vindictive,"" the order reads.

Notably, the upcoming hearing is particularly high stakes for the Trump administration – and could upend their entire case.

""If the government fails to carry its burden at the evidentiary hearing, however, the Court need not resolve the government's Motion [to quash] on the merits, as the [defense motion to dismiss] would be granted without need for any further discovery,"" the order goes on.

Still, the court explains, the current procedural ""landscape"" of the case is something of a double-edged sword for the defense.

Again, the ruling, at length:

Because Abrego has already affirmatively satisfied the threshold question of whether he is entitled to a presumption that his prosecution is vindictive, his subpoenas of [DOJ officials] serve to support the third step of the vindictive prosecution inquiry, i.e., whether he can establish pretext and actual vindictiveness. But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to. According to Abrego, the Government has already shown that it cannot do so, given what Abrego asserts to be troves of evidence in the record indicating that his prosecution is actually vindictive. Based on this record, Abrego argues that the Court could rule on his Motion [to dismiss] without an evidentiary hearing or the testimony of [DOJ officials].

In other words, the current state of motions practice has diminished the need for discovery requested by the defense. But if the government can solicit testimony that works in its favor, the court strongly hints such discovery might very well come into play.

American justice ceases to function when its arbiters silence law enforcement and give megaphones to those who oppose our legal system.”

In the video, which was posted to TikTok on Friday, Abrego Garcia can be seen lip-syncing to “Himno de Victoria” by Danny Berrios. In a second video posted to the platform, Abrego Garcia records the sky and trees before turning the camera toward himself and singing along to Jesús Adrián Romero’s “Sumérgeme.”

Employees of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are under a gag order preventing them from making comments that could prejudice the public or interfere with Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

Earlier this month, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers accused Border Patrol officer Greg Bovino of repeated violations of the gag order, citing comments made on national television in which he referred to Abrego Garcia as an “alien smuggler” and “wife beater,” then asked the court to impose sanctions.

Under the auspices of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security, including Noem herself, have worked overtime to smear Abrego Garcia, repeatedly describing him as a “monster,” human trafficker, domestic abuser, child predator, and MS-13 gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland for years with his American wife and child, has not been convicted of any crimes, and denies any involvement in MS-13.

Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has become one of the most high-profile targets of President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation strategy.

After a judge ordered that the 30-year-old be returned to the U.S., the Trump administration immediately began working to deport him again, considering locations like Uganda and Liberia, countries to which he has no ties, and indicting him on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia was released from custody on Dec. 11 after a federal judge determined that the government had no viable plan for deporting him.

Abrego Garcia has agreed to be deported to Costa Rica, and the Costa Rican government has agreed to accept him on humanitarian grounds, but the Trump administration has insisted that Costa Rica is unwilling to accept him despite evidence to the contrary.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4ol1N03mIFjUnLMul9K3sQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/9bb66e4b0989a7e8d2f08484789506aa,N,,2025-12-28 07:56:32.021446
