The incident happened on Milton Road near Tipperary Place around 2 p.m. Medic said one person suffered non-life-threatening injuries in a medical incident.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department dispelled rumors about a shooting in the area. Police said an unrelated two-vehicle crash happened in the area at the same time, but did not involve protestors or Border Patrol agents.

In response, the Department of Homeland Security reshared a post by Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin about the situation. McLaughlin stated that the man suffered a panic attack. She said he attempted to escape through the ceiling tiles of the hospital bathroom. No further confirmation about the situation was shared other than this social media post.

McLaughlin said the man had a prior arrest for assault.

The Trump administration has targeted Charlotte in what it says is an effort to combat crime, despite objections from local leaders.

By Sunday, reports of CBP activity around Charlotte were ""overwhelming,"" according to Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, who said agents were spotted at churches, apartment complexes, and stores.

At least one U.S. citizen said he was thrown to the ground and briefly detained on Saturday. Two people were arrested during a small protest on Sunday outside a DHS office.

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein on Sunday sharply criticized the tactics of federal immigration agents operating in Charlotte, saying masked officers in unmarked cars were racially profiling residents and targeting American citizens, undermining rather than enhancing public safety.

""We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks,"" Stein said.

Stein called on Congress to address what he described as a broken immigration system, advocating for strong borders, deportation of those who commit serious crimes, and a path to legal status for longtime residents who have paid taxes and followed the law.",https://media.wcnc.com/assets/WCNC/images/f02f9030-2174-43db-8313-afb9ca092895/20251117T011323/f02f9030-2174-43db-8313-afb9ca092895_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:56:43.286711

The Guardian says the home secretary's plans to overhaul the asylum system have prompted ""significant unease"" among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on ""resignation watch"". Party insiders have told the i Paper that the success - or otherwise - of the changes will determine whether or not Labour wins the next general election. The Times describes the plans as a ""significant escalation"" of government action against illegal immigration. But the Daily Mail claims that Labour backbenchers and left-wing lawyers are poised to defeat them.

The Sun's editorial also sounds a note of scepticism about the likely success of Shabana Mahmood's plans. It says they are ""doomed to failure unless she takes the only step that deep down she must know will end the crisis - quitting the flawed and outdated European Convention on Human Rights"". The Telegraph focuses on the government's plan to stop issuing UK visas to people from three African countries which refuse to take back failed asylum seekers. The paper says the bans mirror a policy introduced by Donald Trump, and could in the future be applied to Iran, Bangladesh, and Somalia.

There is still plenty of pre-Budget speculation. The Times claims a new tax will be levied on tourists, which will allow metropolitan mayors to raise hundreds of millions of pounds for local services. The Telegraph claims a tax on milkshakes is being lined up, to make the public healthier. The Financial Times thinks online sports gambling is in the chancellor's sights - but says that horseracing will be exempted.

The Mirror says all plaques bearing the name of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor have been removed from the Falkland Islands. It says he was once hailed as hero there, but he has now been ""erased"" because of his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The Times thinks there are signs that striking resident doctors in England are turning against their union, the BMA. It quotes a letter to hospital chiefs from the NHS chief executive, which says ""there have been fewer doctors striking"" in this walkout than in any of the 12 previous rounds of industrial action. The BMA has said striking is a last resort.

DHS recently submitted a court filing as part of a lawsuit brought by the watchdog group American Oversight, stating that it had deactivated its system that automatically preserved text messages.

Public records hand Justice Department, FBI two black eyes

The Justice Department’s case against former FBI director James Comey hinges in large part on an assertion that Comey authorized someone “at the FBI” to engage with the media about the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton. Lawfare’s Anna Bower dug through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act records, recently released in response to a 2018 FOIA lawsuit brought by The Daily Caller and posted in the FBI’s online FOIA library, “The Vault,” and discovered evidence that appears to undermine Justice’s case against Comey. The public records show that the person “at the FBI” — Daniel Richman — wasn’t a bureau employee during the communications cited by prosecutors.

Considering the possible implications for the Comey case, my big question is: How long will it take FBI director Kash Patel, who is already allegedly furious that his public flight schedules revealed he was abusing government property to visit his girlfriend and visit a place called “Boondoggle Ranch,” to try and take down politically inconvenient documents from The Vault?",https://media.freedom.press/media/images/26250149848_380687e3a3_b.original.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:57:02.426748

Enriquez’s organization, Little Village Community Council, saw its volunteer walking group which escorts children to school, grow from 13 to 32 students.
Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members.","CHICAGO -- Baltazar Enriquez starts most mornings with street patrols, leaving his home in Chicago’s Little Village on foot or by car to find immigration agents that have repeatedly targeted his largely Mexican neighborhood.

Wearing an orange whistle around his neck, the activist broadcasts his plans on Facebook.

“We don’t know if they’re going to come back. All we know is we’ve got to get ready,” he tells thousands of followers. “Give us any tips if you see any suspicious cars.”

Moments later, his phone buzzes.

As an unprecedented immigration crackdown enters a third month, a growing number of Chicago residents are fighting back against what they deem a racist and aggressive overreach of the federal government. The Democratic stronghold’s response has tapped established activists and everyday residents from wealthy suburbs to working class neighborhoods.

They say their efforts — community patrols, rapid responders, school escorts, vendor buyouts, honking horns and blowing whistles — are a uniquely Chicago response that other cities President Donald Trump has targeted for federal intervention want to model.

“The strategy here is to make us afraid. The response from Chicago is a bunch of obscenities and ‘no,’” said Anna Zolkowski Sobor, whose North Side neighborhood saw agents throw tear gas and tackle an elderly man. “We are all Chicagoans who deserve to be here. Leave us alone.”

Perhaps the clearest indicator of Chicago’s growing resistance is the sound of whistles.

Enriquez is credited with being among the first to introduce the concept. For months Little Village residents have used them to broadcast the persistent presence of immigration agents.

Furious blasts both warn and attract observers who record video or criticize agents. Arrests, often referred to as kidnappings because many agents cover their faces, draw increasingly agitated crowds. Immigration agents have responded aggressively.

Officers fatally shot one man during a traffic stop, while other agents use tear gas, rubber bullets and physical force. In early November, Chicago police were called to investigate shots fired at agents. No one was injured.

Activists say they discourage violence.

“We don’t have guns. All we have is a whistle,” Enriquez said. “That has become a method that has saved people from being kidnapped and unlawful arrest.”

By October, neighborhoods citywide were hosting so-called “Whistlemania” events to pack the brightly colored devices for distribution through businesses and free book hutches.

“They want that orange whistle,” said Gabe Gonzalez, an activist. “They want to nod to each other in the street and know they are part of this movement.”

Even with its 2.7 million people, Chicago residents like to say the nation’s third-largest city operates as a collection of small towns with Midwest sensibilities.

People generally know their neighbors and offer help. Word spreads quickly.

When immigration agents began targeting food vendors, Rick Rosales, enlisted his bicycle advocacy group Cycling x Solidarity. He hosted rides to visit street vendors, buying out their inventory to lower their risk while supporting their business.

Irais Sosa, co-founder of the apparel store Sin Titulo, started a neighbor program with grocery runs and rideshare gift cards for families afraid of venturing out.

“That neighborhood feel and support is part of the core of Chicago,” she said.

Enriquez’s organization, Little Village Community Council, saw its volunteer walking group which escorts children to school, grow from 13 to 32 students.

Many also credit the grassroots nature of the resistance to Chicago's long history of community and union organizing.

Trump's “border czar” Tom Homan said Chicago area residents were so familiar with their rights that making arrests during a different operation this year was difficult.

So when hundreds of federal agents arrived in September, activists poured energy into an emergency hotline that dispatches response teams to gather intel, including names of those detained. Volunteers would also circulate videos online, warn of reoccurring license plates or follow agents' cars while honking horns.

Protests have also cropped up quickly. Recently, high school students have launched walkouts.

Delilah Hernandez, 16, was among dozens from Farragut Career Academy who protested on a school day.She held a sign with the Constitution's preamble as she walked in Little Village. She knows many people with detained relatives.

“There is so much going on,” she said. “You feel it.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested during the so-called “ Operation Midway Blitz.” Dozens of U.S. citizens and protesters have been arrested with charges ranging from resisting arrest to conspiring to impede an officer.

The Department of Homeland Security defends the operation, alleging officers face hostile crowds as they pursue violent criminals.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who’s brought controversial tactics from operations in Los Angeles, called Chicago a “very non permissive environment.” He blamed sanctuary protections and elected leaders and defended agents’ actions, which are the subject of lawsuits.

But the operation's intensity could subside soon.

Bovino told The Associated Press this month that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will target other cities. He didn't elaborate, but Homeland Security officials confirmed Saturday that an immigration enforcement surge had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

DHS, which oversees CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said operations won't end in Chicago.

Alonso Zaragoza, with a neighborhood organization in the heavily immigrant Belmont Cragin, has printed hundreds of “No ICE” posters for businesses. Organizers in Oregon and Missouri have asked for advice.

“It’s become a model for other cities,” Zaragoza said. “We’re building leaders in our community who are teaching others.”

The turnout for virtual know-your-rights trainings offered by the pro-democracy group, States at the Core, doubled from 500 to 1,000 over a recent month, drawing participants from New Jersey and Tennessee.

“We train and we let go, and the people of Chicago are the ones who run with it,” said organizer Jill Garvey.

Enriquez completes up to three patrol shifts daily. Beyond the physical exertion, the work takes a toll.

Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members. A U.S. citizen relative was handcuffed by agents. His car horn no longer works, which he attributes to overuse.

“This has been very traumatizing,” he said. “It is very scary because you will remember this for the rest of your life.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/be83d873-9bdc-4037-8614-ae28334d13bc/wirestory_df72b2ba4e57befc085d692d227363b8_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:39.156637

Britain will overhaul its approach to human rights laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive in the country illegally as part of a major shake-up of asylum policy to be set out on Monday.

Interior minister Shabana Mahmood will outline changes to how the European Convention on Human Rights will be interpreted by courts, the government said.

""These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,"" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.

In what the government claims to be the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

Britain's Labour government is taking a tougher stance as it struggles to curb clandestine migration, particularly via small boat crossings. Polls indicate immigration is a top concern of voters, and the populist Reform UK party has a commanding lead in polls.

TOUGHER STANCE

The government said Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a family life, was being misused by migrants to delay their removal from Britain.

It wants new laws to make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from ""using dubious connections to stay in the UK"".

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the ""definition of 'inhuman and degrading treatment' has expanded beyond what is reasonable.""

The government has said it wants to remain in the European Convention on Human Rights, amid calls from Reform and some in the Conservative Party for Britain to leave it altogether.

However, the government's harder stance on immigration has been criticised by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

""These proposals will punish people who've already lost everything,"" said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture. ""Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country.""

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said Britain was a ""fair, tolerant and compassionate country,"" but that in a more volatile world ""people need to know our borders are secure.""

The government added that there would also be reforms to streamline the appeals system, to fast-track the deportation of criminals and to prevent against misuse of modern slavery laws to impede removals.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:41.821972

On Monday, Mahmood will announce controversial new laws to overhaul refugee status, which must be reassessed every two years, as well as curbing asylum appeals and toughening the approach to rights to family life.

The home secretary warned in an article for the Guardian that anger about illegal migration could turn on second-generation immigrants such as her and rupture community relations.

“I know that a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me,” she said.

But the Guardian understands the harshness of Mahmood’s plans has led to significant unease among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on resignation watch. Two said they were particularly concerned about the plans to ramp up deportations of refugee families, including those with children.

Charities warned it would risk “another Windrush scandal” and leave refugees in near-permanent limbo, with children liable to be unrooted from schools and adults unable to build careers, and make integration harder.

The home secretary will announce three new safe routes for refugees to legally come to the UK from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Eritrea, but even the status of those refugees will be under constant review.

Mahmood confirmed on Sunday that refugees would be liable to be returned if their country was no longer deemed dangerous, with their status reviewed every 30 months, including families with young children in school.

The government will announce that it will legislate to toughen how courts apply the European convention on human rights (ECHR) regarding family life, enabling more deportation of people with family members still in the UK.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

In her article for the Guardian, Mahmood said she knew the changes would “face opposition” but said the alternative would risk public support for all refugees collapsing.

“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate. We must take the opportunity we have to stop that from happening. And I know we can,” she wrote.

“The true nature of this country is openness, tolerance and generosity. We want to provide sanctuary to those in danger. We want to be a Greater Britain, not a littler England. To do so, we must restore order and control.”

Mahmood will announce three “modest” routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan, Palestine or Eritrea to come if they are students and those seeking to work in certain professions, as well as those sponsored by community and voluntary organisations who support them when they arrive. Refugees arriving via those routes will not be given permanent settled status.

Other key measures to be announced on Monday include:

Restricting asylum seekers to one single appeal rather than different appeals on multiple grounds.

Creating a new body for fast-tracking cases for dangerous criminals and those with little hope of success.

Legislating to restrict last-minute modern slavery claims

Joining other countries in seeking reform of ECHR article 3 rights, to more narrowly define the risk of torture and degrading treatment.

Changing the Home Office’s duty to provide support to asylum seekers to a discretionary power, enabling them to potentially be removed from accommodation.

Several senior aides are understood to have severe reservations about how that would affect school-age children and MPs are understood to be particularly concerned about Ukrainian refugees, many of whom brought young children who have now fully integrated into British life.

“These sweeping changes will mean that a child who is settled at school, studying hard for their GCSEs, will be uprooted and forcibly removed, possibly being put in detention as part of that process,” the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon said, likening it to how long-settled people were treated under the Windrush scandal.

Mahmood is also understood to be seeking to legislate to change the way the ECHR is interpreted by UK judges. Asylum seekers often use its provisions on right to family life in order to stay in the UK.

The effect of the changes could mean many more people are deported from the UK even if they have young children living here. Judges will be required to prioritise “public safety” over family rights. A Home Office source suggested this would be more likely to apply to extended family.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.

“Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders,” she wrote in the Guardian.

“My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.”

The Home Office has briefed widely that Mahmood has been inspired by the Danish system, which has much tighter rules on family reunions as well as on refugee status.

Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, temporarily suspended new applications in September from a family reunion route that allowed those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family.

Home Office sources have suggested the asylum changes will have far wider effects than anything brought in by the Conservatives.

Almost 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats to claim asylum in the UK so far this year and the number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high. Government figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025.

Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave the ECHR in order to undertake more severe measures to cut migration. Mahmood has said she will not leave the ECHR, but there are likely to be significant legal challenges to what she is proposing on Monday.

The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.

But the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, criticised the plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”.

He told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Several loyalist MPs told the Guardian they were deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of disrupting the lives of settled refugee families if their countries became safer to return to. At least one minister is understood to have severe reservations.

The Labour MP Tony Vaughan urged the government to “think again” on the changes. “The prime minister said in September that we are at a fork in the road. These asylum proposals suggest we have taken the wrong turning,” he posted on X.

“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

The Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that leaving refugees in a state of “perpetual limbo” for 20 years was economically as well as morally damaging. “If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what is generating refugees or how to respond to them,” she said.

“If you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or voluntary support.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0306afc05b3889975ec0cccb99b6e3b7b91945a/556_190_3808_3046/master/3808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57c95e34d7dea960e716f67ac913f689",N,,2025-11-16 18:56:45.797224

Under sweeping reforms unveiled by the home secretary, the government will attempt to change the way the European Convention on Human Rights is interpreted by UK judges in a bid to stop asylum seekers using their rights to a family life to avoid deportation.

Home Office officials have claimed the ECHR “is allowing large numbers of people to stay in the UK, against the public’s wishes”, and that new legislation will allow Britain to ramp up the number of removals.

The radical measures are part of much-publicised reform of the asylum system, billed by the government as “the most sweeping reforms in modern times”, as Labour looks to see off the threat of Reform UK and Nigel Farage.

But critics have hit out at the proposals, warning any move to alter how the UK interprets the rules will drive asylum seekers underground and leave them vulnerable to exploitation.

Sile Reynolds, the head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the changes “will punish people who’ve already lost everything”, adding: “Either we all have human rights, or none of us do.”

The measures could also spark discontent on the backbenches, with one Labour MP accusing the party leadership of “chasing Reform”. They told The Independent: “The dehumanisation of people in desperation is the antithesis of what the Labour Party is about.”

Announcing the changes, Sir Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said they will “block endless appeals” and “stop last minute claims”.

He said: “Britain has always been a fair, tolerant and compassionate country – and this government will always defend those values.

“But, in a more volatile world, people need to know our borders are secure and rules are enforced.

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here.”

Shabana Mahmood will set out plans to rewrite how Britain grants refuge to those fleeing conflict and upheaval on Monday, drawing heavily on ideas used in Denmark, where Home Office officials were dispatched last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Under the proposed changes, ministers want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the ECHR – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases a bid to stop migrants “gaming the system” and to “rebalance public interest tests in favour of the British people’s expectations”.

The home secretary also wants to tighten up rules on family connections so that only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay in future.

Rules will also be updated to change modern slavery laws, which officials claim are being abused by “bogus” claims, while the appeals process will be updated to restrict illegal migrants to a single route of appeal to stop them “chancing their arm with challenge after challenge”.

The UK will also be working on further reform around Article 3, which relates to the prohibition of torture. Officials have claimed the definition of inhuman and degrading treatment “has expanded too far”, citing cases where serious criminals have remained in the UK after claims their healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Ms Mahmood teased the changes on Sunday, telling Sky News that ministers want to “constrain in legislation the way that that is applied in immigration cases”, when it comes to Article 8.

She said it is the “right thing to do, because we've seen an expansion of the way that that right is applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country”.

But the Refugee Council, a charity advocating on behalf of refugees, warned that watering down these laws risks chaos and will drive desperate people underground, leaving them prone to exploitation.

Following the home secretary’s comments on Sunday morning, Enver Solomon, the charity’s chief executive said: “After the horrors of the Second World War, Britain helped draft the European Convention on Human Rights as part of our collective vow of ‘never again’. Its purpose was to protect all of us from atrocities and ensure people who come to our country seeking safety get a fair chance to apply for asylum.”

He described the UK’s legal system as “the difference between life and death for many” and added: “The government has a choice to make: we can build a fair and compassionate asylum system that determines who qualifies for protection and who does not. Or we can water down laws that protect us all and risk chaos: desperate people would still arrive on our shores, but be driven underground and left vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.”

Ms Reynolds accused political parties of being in a “race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees”.

She said: “Every day we see the trauma of people who have survived torture in countries like Syria, Eritrea and Sudan for standing up for the same freedoms we cherish in Britain. Instead of offering safety, political parties are locked in a race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees.

“These proposals will punish people who’ve already lost everything, cutting them off from safety and hope. But either we all have human rights, or none of us do.

“Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country. This is a cynical attempt to scapegoat vulnerable people to win political points. We can and must do better.”

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is “welcome that Shabana Mahmood is finally talking seriously about tackling illegal migration”, but added: “As we saw with Keir Starmer’s lamentable U-turn on modest welfare cuts, the prime minister always folds in the face of opposition from his left-wing backbenchers.

“If the home secretary actually wants to cut illegal immigration, she should take up my offer to sit down with her and work on a plan that will actually stop the boats, rather than a few weak changes that will meet the approval of Labour MPs.”

Other changes expected as part of the raft of measures are the removal of the automatic right to housing and financial support for asylum seekers, and changes to refugee status which will make it temporary and subject to review every two-and-a-half years. Those who arrive in the UK via means such as a small boat or lorry also face a 20-year wait to stay in the country permanently.

Jennifer McKiernanPolitical reporter

Plans to fast-track the deportations of illegal migrants as part of a sweeping reforms of the UK's asylum policy are to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

In a statement to MPs on Monday she will outline plans to end multiple appeals against removal and for an overhaul of legislation on human rights law.

For those granted asylum they will only be given it on a temporary basis and will be returned home if their country is at any time deemed safe. They will have to wait 20 years to apply to settle permanently.

Mahmood is also warn the UK will stop granting visas to people from three African countries if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals of illegal migrants.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would go further and deport failed asylum seekers ""within a week"".

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including Rachael Maskell, who said the government was going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration.

The government wants to reduce the number of people arriving to the UK on small boats and the reforms aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Under the plans people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

As part of the reforms, Mahmood wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied in migration court cases.

Only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

The UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

Similarly, the Home Office said the Modern Slavery Act will be tightened up to prevent last-minute claims to block removal.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the reforms would stop ""endless appeals"" to increase the removals of ""those with no right to be here"".

Mahmood said the reforms recognised the ""pace and scale"" of immigration had destabilised and divided communities and would allow the government to ramp up the removal of those with no right to be in Britain.

She continued: ""To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.""

Earlier the home secretary told the BBC she would create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

Under the new measures there will be tighter restrictions placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

They will not be able to bring family members to join them unless they are immediate relatives, including parents and children, while housing and weekly allowances will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

'Years of limbo'

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.

There has also been criticism of the proposed reforms from within Labour, with Maskell saying lots of her fellow MPs were ""really concerned"".

She said it was important to have a robust human rights framework and described ""reordering our relationship with the ECHR"" as a ""step too far"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said the home secretary ""sounds like a Reform supporter"".

""It's a shame that the Human Rights Act, ECHR and her own backbenchers mean that this will never happen,"" he added.

Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said the government should ""focus on processing claims quickly, getting them right first time, and swiftly deporting people with no right to be here"".

Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year time frame would ""leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years"".

As first reported in the Times, the threat of the visa ban for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.
Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems.
“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.” Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system.
A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.","Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

The new 20-year qualifying period will apply to those who arrive illegally, such as in small boats or in lorries, and claim asylum, or those who overstay their visas and then claim. It will be the longest route to settlement in Europe; Denmark is second, with an eight-year pathway.

The changes, hailed as the largest overhaul since the Second World War, will apply only to new arrivals.

In the year to June, a total of 111,000 people claimed asylum in the UK. In the year ending March, 172,798 people were granted ILR under the process.

There will be some mitigations for skilled refugees, enabling them to truncate the 20-year qualification period by going into “specific” work or study routes. “It will be essentially a system whereby the more you contribute, you can bring forward that [20-year] period,” Mahmood said.

A ten-year pathway will also be created for those who arrive in the UK legally, under new specific refugee settlement routes to be announced by Mahmood on Thursday.

The plans are modelled on reforms in Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

Mahmood will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers. The government intends to use legislation to repeal a European Union directive that underpins the requirement.

‘We want them to work’

Housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also face having their support withdrawn.

Mahmood said: “Before that directive, we actually had a much more discretionary power that we could use, where we could make our own decision about whether we are going to offer someone asylum support or not. The reason we’re doing that [reverting to the previous powers] is that there are some people who currently receive asylum support who can work, who have the right to work, and we want them to work.”

She will also announce reforms to the application of key elements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including article 8, the right to a family life. She is expected to raise the need for international reform of article 3, covering torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.

‘Our fundamental nature is generous’

The home secretary believes the changes are necessary to address voters’ sense of unfairness when asylum seekers are treated more generously than economic migrants who arrive on visas, despite the fact that the latter group must meet strict financial and integration requirements.

Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems. “I think that people rightly feel that the pace and the scale of what we’ve seen is out of control. It’s putting a huge amount of pressure on communities,” she said. “My patch is 70 per cent non-white, but immigration is something that’s causing just as much concern here as it does all across other parts of the country.

“I think our fundamental nature as a people is that we are open, tolerant and generous,” she said, but the “precondition of unlocking the full extent of that openness is order and control”.

President Trump told GB News on Friday that Sir Keir Starmer “better do something on immigration”, describing some of those who arrived on small boats as “bad people” and warning: “If you don’t get them out, you’re not going to have a country left”.

Mahmood argued that the changes would make it both easier to remove illegal immigrants already in Britain and deter those considering crossing the Channel in small boats. “I can see a system that is out of control, I can see a system that is unfair and I can see a system that’s putting huge pressure on communities, including my own,” she said.

‘It’s designed to say: Do not get on a boat’

Her reforms would seek to “change the assumptions” about what it means to be a refugee, while also changing the “calculus and the thinking” of those people who are risking their lives on small boats by reducing the so-called pull factors that are drawing illegal immigrants.

This will include ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. That will rise to 20 years and will have certain conditions attached, such as having no criminal record.

“That is designed to essentially say to people: do not come to this country as an illegal migrant, do not get on a boat,” she said. “I think it’s important that we send a very clear signal to those people who are currently trekking across multiple safe countries across Europe looking to get on a boat in the north of France: this is not a journey worth making.”

President Macron of France has called on the UK to address the pull factors behind small-boat crossings. Germany is already committed to working with the UK on the issue and Mahmood is understood to be in “embryonic talks” with Belgium and the Netherlands.

Mahmood, the eldest daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir and a devout Muslim, said that she knew the reforms would be a hard sell to some in her party, who are concerned that Labour is trying to mimic Conservative and Reform policies.

Some Labour MPs on the left have branded the reforms as “racist”, including Nadia Whittome, the member for Nottingham East, who accused the government of pursuing the “policies of the far right”.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, called the plans “harsh and unnecessary”, arguing they “won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars”.

Mahmood said she rejected “entirely” suggestions that her policy change was racist, pointing out that her parents came to the UK legally in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

“This is a moral mission for me,” she told Sky News on Sunday. “I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.”

Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem..”

She said that the Home Office would “bring order and control back” into the asylum system while also creating new safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to enter the UK.

The government announced last month that two army barracks, one in East Sussex and one in Scotland, would be used to house asylum seekers from December, as ministers seek to end the use of hotels within a year.

This month, a leaked Home Office document suggested that the government had identified at least 14 sites that could host up to 10,000 migrants.

On Sunday, about 2,000 people marched through the streets of Crowborough, East Sussex, to protest against plans to house 600 lone male asylum seekers in a nearby army camp.

The Crowborough site and Cameron Barracks in Inverness are the only two to have been publicly announced so far.

A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.

Mahmood is seen as a rising star and has hinted that she may harbour leadership ambitions. Last week, Mahmood, who is one of Starmer’s closest allies, pledged her support to the prime minister and chancellor, adding: “I know that they will put the best interest of the whole country absolutely first and foremost as they make the difficult choices that are needed to get the budget to balance.”

However, she will know that if they fail, she could soon be in a new job and it will be her facing all the difficult choices — and not just how to stop the boats.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fe2ca745c-962c-4a02-9b0c-35bbf0b16603.jpg?crop=4236%2C2383%2C1374%2C492&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-16 20:56:55.091827

It was one of the deadliest maritime smuggling incidents in waters off the U.S. coast.","A wooden skiff believed to have been ferrying migrants toward the U.S. capsized in stormy seas near San Diego, leaving at least four people dead and four hospitalized, the Coast Guard said Saturday.

The U.S. Border Patrol found the vessel in the surf off Imperial Beach late Friday night. Six people were found on the beach just before midnight, one of whom was pronounced dead and another who was rescued after being found under the boat.

About two hours later, authorities received a report of someone in the water near Imperial Beach Pier. A Coast Guard crew responded and found three people in the ocean, all dead.

The Coast Guard said Saturday that it was continuing to search for others who may have been on board.

Several of the survivors claimed Mexican nationality, while others remained unidentified, the agency said. One person was turned over to the Department of Homeland Security.

“Our crews and partner agencies responded immediately, but this case demonstrates the severe risks posed to aliens attempting to enter the United States by sea in unstable vessels,” said Coast Guard Capt. Robert Tucker, Sector San Diego commander.

A strong storm system hit Southern California over the weekend, prompting warnings of flash flooding and mudslides. The vessel was a panga — single- or twin-engine open fishing boat that is also commonly used by smugglers.

Migrants are increasingly turning to the risky alternative offered by smugglers to travel by sea to avoid heavily guarded land borders, including off California’s coast. Pangas leave Mexico in the dead of night and sometimes chart hundreds of miles (kilometers) north.

There have been several incidents in recent years of migrant vessels capsizing en route to California.

In May, at least three people died when a panga flipped off the coast about 35 miles (56 km) north of the U.S.-Mexico border.

In 2023, eight people were killed when two migrant smuggling boats approached a San Diego beach in heavy fog and one of them capsized in the surf. It was one of the deadliest maritime smuggling incidents in waters off the U.S. coast.

A federal judge sentenced a San Diego man to 18 years in prison in 2022 for piloting a small vessel overloaded with 32 migrants that smashed apart in powerful surf off the coast, killing three people and injuring more than two dozen.

Now, though, the government is pledging to overhaul the asylum system, which handles those who land on its shores, arguing that it has turned the country into a magnet for people.","Britain rolled out a major hardening of its rules for handling asylum seekers on Sunday, reflecting the rapidly changing politics of immigration as successive British governments have failed to curb a rising influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in often unseaworthy boats.

Under the new rules, drafted by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, people granted asylum status would have to wait 20 years, rather than the current five, before they can apply to settle permanently in Britain.

The government plans to review the status of these migrants more regularly, and if it determines at any point that their countries have become safe, they will be ordered to return home. Asylum seekers will also no longer be entitled to automatic aid, including housing and weekly allowances. Those who have a right to work in Britain will be expected to find jobs while their claims are being considered, something they are not allowed to do under the existing rules.

“Illegal migration is causing huge divides here in our own country,” Ms. Mahmood said in an interview Sunday with the BBC. “I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.”

The Labour government’s proposed changes emulate a much tougher asylum policy put in place by Denmark. The Danish system, devised like that in Britain by a center-left government, grants asylum seekers residence permits of only one or two years, with no guarantee of permanent residence. To gain permanent status, new arrivals must learn Danish and find work.

Since the rules were tightened, the number of people granted asylum in Denmark has plummeted, ending an influx of migrants, mainly from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other once war-torn countries.

Denmark’s policies have been criticized by human rights groups and challenged by the European Court of Human Rights. Its system has nevertheless become a model for other European governments, which are struggling with what many citizens view as uncontrolled immigration. Britain’s home office, which polices borders, said it had sent a delegation to Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, last summer to examine the Danish system.

But the British government’s proposals got a mixed reaction at home, where immigration has again become a salient issue in the years since Britain left the European Union. The government said that, since coming into power in July 2024, it had deported 50,000 people who had entered Britain illegally.

Nigel Farage, the leader of the anti-immigrant party Reform U.K., had rare praise for Ms. Mahmood’s tough tone. But he said the new policies would have little effect if, as he predicted, British judges and the European Court of Human Rights uphold legal challenges to deportation orders. Reform has used its anti-immigrant appeal to establish a double-digit lead over Labour in the polls.

“Labour won’t stop the boats,” Mr. Farage posted on social media on Friday, as word of the plans began leaking out.

For the government, the new proposals underscore how swiftly the political landscape has changed. Prime Minister Keir Starmer once cast the flow of asylum seekers as primarily a law enforcement problem, vowing to break up the gangs that traffic people across the English Channel from France.

Now, though, the government is pledging to overhaul the asylum system, which handles those who land on its shores, arguing that it has turned the country into a magnet for people.

The home office said that from 2021 to 2025, asylum claims dropped across much of Europe but increased in Britain. Yet Britain continues to receive fewer claims than its European counterparts: 109,343 in the year ending in March 2025, compared with 218,550 in Germany, 164,830 in Spain, 159,260 in France, and 151,525 in Italy, according to statistics released by the British government.

Europe remains a favored destination for people fleeing war, political instability, economic deprivation and other hardships. In Britain, Pakistanis are the largest group of those seeking asylum.

Critics of the government’s plan said it echoed the language of far-right parties. Clive Lewis, a Labour member of Parliament, told the BBC the plan might drive left-wing voters to the Green Party. But with the Labour Party’s huge majority in Parliament, there is little doubt that it will become law.

Ms. Mahmood, 45, a rising star in the government who became home secretary in a cabinet shake-up in September, emphasized her immigrant roots in promoting the policy. Born in Birmingham to parents with Pakistani roots, Ms. Mahmood studied law at Oxford University and worked as a barrister.

“Immigration is absolutely woven into my experience as a Brit, and also that of thousands of my constituents,” she said on the BBC program “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.”

“This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/multimedia/16int-uk-immigration-02-ckfv/16int-uk-immigration-02-ckfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 14:56:38.969589

President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here’s what to know:

Why send agents to Charlotte?

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina’s two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

How have locals reacted?

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

Is the National Guard involved?

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor’s office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

Crackdown, inspired by Denmark's policy, draws criticism from charities, rights groups

Britain said it would make refugee status temporary and the wait for permanent settlement would be quadrupled to 20 years under the country's most sweeping overhaul of policy on asylum seekers in modern times.

The Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies, above all on illegal small-boat crossings from France, in efforts to stem the soaring popularity of the populist Reform UK party, which has driven the immigration agenda.

The government said it would take inspiration from Denmark's approach. Its policy has been widely criticized by rights groups and is one of the toughest in Europe — where growing anti-immigrant sentiment has led to increased restrictions in many countries.

As part of the changes, the statutory duty to provide support to certain asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked, the Home Office (interior ministry) said in a statement issued late on Saturday.

The department, led by Shabana Mahmood, said the measures would apply to asylum seekers who can work but choose not to and to those who break the law. It said that taxpayer-funded support would be prioritized for those contributing to the economy and local communities.

The Home Office also said that protection for refugees would ""now be temporary, regularly reviewed and revoked"" if the home country was deemed safe.

""Our system is particularly generous compared to other countries in Europe, where, after five years, you're effectively automatically settled in this country. We will change that,"" Mahmood told Sky News on Sunday.

She added that under the changes, a refugee's status would be reviewed every 2½ years, during ""a much longer path to permanent settlement in this country of 20 years.""

Mahmood said she would provide further details of the changes on Monday, including an announcement on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

The government has said it wants to stay in the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR) but change how the Article 8 provision, covering the right to a family life, is interpreted.

Mahmood said it was being ""applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country.""

The government's tougher approach has drawn criticism. More than 100 British charities wrote to Mahmood urging her to ""end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm,"" saying such steps are fueling racism and violence.

Polls suggest immigration has overtaken the economy as British voters' top concern. Over the summer, protests took place outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

A total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the U.K. in the year ending March 2025, a 17 per cent rise on the previous year and six per cent above the 2002 peak of 103,081.

Mahmood said the government would look to open more ""safe and legal"" routes for asylum seekers, as she believed Britain should play its part in helping those fleeing danger.

Looking to European countries

The Home Office said its reforms would look to ""match and in some areas exceed"" the standards of Denmark and other European countries, where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration in society is expected.

Asylum seekers are granted temporary residence permits under Denmark's approach, usually for two years, and they must reapply when these expire. They can be repatriated if their home country is deemed safe, and the path to citizenship has also been lengthened.

The Home Office said Denmark's more restrictive immigration policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the deportation of 95 per cent of rejected applicants.

Denmark's reforms, implemented while it remains a signatory to the ECHR, have drawn sharp criticism. Rights groups say the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged limbo.

Britain's Refugee Council said on X that refugees do not compare asylum systems while fleeing danger, and that they come to the U.K. because of family ties, some knowledge of English or existing connections that help them start anew safely.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-16 12:57:18.499903

This is the latest city to unwillingly receive federal agents in President Donald Trump’s illegal immigration crackdown.

The federal government hasn’t provided a full explanation for why this began or how many people have been detained, but DHS blamed the operation in Democratic-led Charlotte on state officials, saying illegal immigrants fled there because of sanctuary policies they believed would protect them.

A DHS press release included a list of migrants the agency called “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” who they say were released onto North Carolina streets because of those policies.

The department has not linked the operation to any single event. However, the fatal stabbing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian on Charlotte’s light rail train has brought heightened national attention to the city in recent months, although the suspect was an American.

Amid the recent enforcement, a Honduran-born United States citizen, Willy Aceituno, was pulled from his vehicle by agents after they smashed his window. He was later released without charges.

“When you have fentanyl being trafficked in cities, when you have Charlotte, North Carolina, a hub of human trafficking, what better tool to put on the ground than the people who are tasked with federal law enforcement in doing exactly what they’re doing,” said Republican Chairman Addul Ali, who represents North Carolina’s 12th congressional district, on NewsNation Saturday.

DHS has not said how long the operation will last, but it comes as federal agents are pulling out of Chicago.

Across the city this weekend, the mood has shifted from confusion to fear. City and county leaders have called the federal raids unnecessary, saying they’re creating panic, not promoting safety.

Immigrant-owned stores shut down, streets were quiet and people avoided daily tasks out of fear they could be targeted.

Migrants granted temporary asylum will no longer be able to automatically and unconditionally bring their spouses or children to the UK.
Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, the Home Secretary denied that the crackdown – which also scraps automatic state handouts to thousands of asylum seekers – was “racist”.
Challenged by Sky presenter Trevor Phillips that Labour had been “panicked” into a “racist” immigration policy, Ms Mahmood said: “I reject that entirely.
The Home Secretary will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances of £49 a week.","Refugees will be barred from bringing their families to the UK unless they can show that they are earning enough to pay for their upkeep without claiming benefits.

Shabana Mahmood will end the current automatic right for successful asylum seekers to bring their spouses and children to the country, irrespective of their earnings.

The moves – to be announced on Monday – are part of the Home Secretary’s overhaul of the asylum system, which will force refugees who enter the UK illegally to wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement.

Ms Mahmood will end what she claims is the “golden ticket” of Britain’s “excessively generous” immigration system, which currently guarantees migrants permanent residency and unconditional access to benefits after they have spent five years in the UK.

She will tell MPs that refugee status will become temporary and reviewed every 30 months. If an asylum seeker’s country is deemed safe at any time, they will be immediately returned.

Migrants granted temporary asylum will no longer be able to automatically and unconditionally bring their spouses or children to the UK.

They will only be allowed to do so if they meet the same financial conditions and standards of English as Britons or migrants on skilled work visas. Britons seeking to bring partners to the UK have to show a combined income of £29,000.

They will also only be entitled to permanent settlement if they meet the same conditions as other migrants, including being in work and paying NI, not claiming benefits, a spotless criminal record, a high standard of English and contribution to British society.

Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing them with access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

Under new legislation, migrants who arrive illegally either on small boats across the Channel or in lorries, or those who overstay their visas and then claim asylum, will instead have to wait 20 years to secure permanent settlement.

There will be some alternative routes for skilled refugees, enabling them to reduce the 20-year qualification by going into specified work or study routes.

Ms Mahmood will also create shorter, 10-year pathways to permanent settlement for genuine refugees who arrive in the UK legally via three new “safe and legal” routes. These will be designed for asylum seekers who are seeking to work or study in Britain or, like the Homes for Ukraine scheme, are sponsored by local UK communities.

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, the Home Secretary denied that the crackdown – which also scraps automatic state handouts to thousands of asylum seekers – was “racist”.

Challenged by Sky presenter Trevor Phillips that Labour had been “panicked” into a “racist” immigration policy, Ms Mahmood said: “I reject that entirely. I am the child of immigrants. My parents came to this country legally in the late 60s and the early 70s. This is a moral mission for me.

“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country. I can see that it is polarising communities across the country. I can see that it is dividing people and making them estranged from one another. I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.

“What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not Right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem. I know because I have now seen this system inside out. It is a broken system. We have a genuine problem to fix.”

Ms Mahmood previously branded Nigel Farage “worse than racist” after the Reform UK leader said he would reassess the migration status of people already granted the right to settle in Britain. Speaking in September, she said Mr Farage had “blown a very, very loud dog whistle to every racist in the country”.

The reforms, hailed as the biggest overhaul since the Second World War, are modelled on Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

High-achieving refugees could bring forward their 20-year qualification date but sources said a refugee who arrived illegally would still face a “penalty” delay even if they were a doctor earning £100,000 a year.

The Home Office is also devising three capped routes for genuine refugees. One would enable talented refugees to come to the UK to study, a second would be for skilled asylum seekers to work in Britain and a third would enable voluntary and community organisations to sponsor refugees.

“I’m sending a clear signal to people: Do not get on a boat. Do not seek to come into this country illegally. That pathway is much more difficult,” said Ms Mahmood.

The Home Secretary will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances of £49 a week.

Under the changes, the support will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to do so. Those who break the law will also face their support being withdrawn. There are currently an estimated 8,500 people in asylum accommodation on visas with the right to work.

Ms Mahmood said: “Just under 10 per cent of the people that are currently in asylum accommodation, primarily in hotels, but also in housing as well across the country, have the right to work.

“At the moment, there is no expectation that despite having that right to work, that those individuals do, in fact, find work and support themselves. There is also no expectation that people have to obey rules in order to retain their asylum accommodation.

“There’s also no expectation that if you break the law of this country, you will lose your accommodation. That actually places those individuals in a better position than most British citizens in social housing in this country.”

Other changes expected to be announced on Monday include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they will face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country.

Some 39,075 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey so far this year, according to the latest Home Office figures.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described the Government’s plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”. He claimed that the Government would make little progress in reducing illegal migration without quitting the European Convention on Human Rights.

He told Sky News: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “These harsh and unnecessary plans won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars. Instead, they are more likely to force them into destitution and sleeping rough on the streets.”

“We see every day in our services how refugees go on to contribute as doctors, nurses, carers, entrepreneurs and valued members of their communities, but some will need an initial safety net to get to that point.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000449323813_17632917818220_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbFS4ctvTRCv11iMWUZHtVhhEnL4rsjDuMz0rfzZf-J8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-11-16 12:57:29.447809

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there are ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a ""certified welcoming city"". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.

""President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,"" the DHS said.

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ‘I’m an American citizen,’” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.

“Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,’” Asciutto said.

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

“This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

“It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

“Half an hour later, he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

“This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.”

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We’re brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don’t know how long this is going to last.”

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”

“Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Why it matters: The high-profile operations have led to surges in arrests. But they've also galvanized local resistance efforts, and created a playbook for activists in other cities when ICE comes to town.

""In Chicago, we pushed back as hard as we could,"" said Brandon Lee, of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

""We're going to work to make sure that the local leaders in North Carolina and wherever else they take their road show of terror after this are as prepared as can be for what's coming.""

The big picture: Operation Midway Blitz, which targeted undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, resulted in 3,000 arrests, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Oct. 30.

The operation in Chicago mirrored prior activities in Los Angeles, where Border Patrol also joined ICE on its mission.

President Trump told ""60 Minutes"" in a recent interview that he wants to see more aggressive tactics in operations across the country, but blamed ""liberal judges"" for restricting immigration agents.

White House Deputy Chief of staff Stephen Miller set a 3,000 arrests per day goal in May. The latest public data shows that even with these targeted operations, the agency is falling short.

Zoom in: In Chicago, activists set up a rapid response team of volunteers, and rallied support from local elected officials, business and faith leaders.

Documenting enforcement: Part of the rapid response volunteer network's role was to film officers making arrests, so they could document any potential excessive uses of force or other violations.

Targeted demonstrations: At least one demonstration blocked the entrance at the Broadview processing facility that was holding immigrants for extended periods of time before they were transferred to permanent detention facilities.

Legal challenges: In the court room, litigators sued the administration over the use of tear gas in the city, the detention conditions at Broadview and for how federal agents made arrests. One case, over warrantless arrests, led to a judge ordering the release of more than 600 people on bond.

Between the lines: Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions are top targets for the immigration crackdown, White House Border Czar Tom Homan has said in multiple interviews.

But resistance to these raids is growing beyond activists and civil rights lawyers. Local business leaders and clergy have joined in calls to halt the aggressive enforcement tactics.

""At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

What's next: ""What we've seen in Los Angeles, what we've seen in Chicago are forces violating people's constitutional rights and wrecking havoc on entire communities,"" said Liz Barber, director of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of North Carolina.

President Donald Trump's administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina's largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration's strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here’s what to know:

Why send agents to Charlotte?

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina's two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

How have locals reacted?

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

Is the National Guard involved?

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina's congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor's office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

Several state lawmakers joined CASA members in Baltimore on Friday to introduce legislation that they say will protect immigrant families.

Maryland counties opted to let ICE collaborate with local law enforcement

In the last eight months, five new Maryland counties have opted in to the 287(g) program that allows collaboration between ICE and local law enforcement.

The new legislation would prevent that, meaning local resources will not be allowed to be used as an extension of ICE if it becomes law.

One Marylander and a member of CASA says the government is being used as a weapon against immigrant communities.

""Where infants are being ripped away from their parents and torn to the side, leaving them behind and grappling with the trauma, ICE is manufacturing a crisis in our communities and that is impacting the lives of thousands of Marylanders,"" said CASA Baltimore and Central Maryland Director, Crisaly De Los Santos.

The new legislation is through the launch of the Brave of Us campaign, which is calling on leadership in the state to help protect immigrants against what they call an authoritarian regime.

""DHS will not be deterred""

While Baltimore County has not opted into the collaboration program, it did recently sign a memorandum of understanding with ICE.

In a statement to WJZ in response to the legislation, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called out state democrats:

Legal experts say that the BBC could show that Trump was not harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.
If Trump sues in Florida, he would need to establish that the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.","Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue the BBC over an edited speech despite the corporation's apology.

Although the BBC apologised and retracted the episode, it refused to compensate Trump, who claims the edited version of a 2021 speech broadcast by Panorama caused him major financial and reputational harm. He intends to seek $1–5 billion in damages.

The prospect of a multi-billion-pound lawsuit is a daunting one for the BBC and the British government, but the president faces legal hurdles on both sides of the Atlantic.

Why is Donald Trump suing?

The dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs series Panorama, titled Trump: A Second Chance? broadcast days before the 2024 US presidential election.

The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell"".

Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.

Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm"".

What do the BBC say?

According to BBC News, the broadcaster set out five main arguments in its letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim.

It said the BBC did not distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels and was restricted on iPlayer to viewers in the UK; that the documentary did not cause Mr Trump harm as he was later re-elected; that the edit was not done with malice and was designed to shorten a long speech; that it was not meant to be considered in isolation but as part of an hour-long programme; and that an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.

Chairman Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation have written to the president’s legal team, strongly disagreeing that there was a basis for a defamation claim.

The broadcaster said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday.

Where could a case be heard?

Trump also said the lawsuit would “probably” be filed “someplace in the US”, but commented that litigation in the UK “moves a little bit quickly”.

However, deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000, expired more than a year ago.

While Florida law has a two-year limit, bringing a defamation case in America will mean Trump faces a tougher legal standard.

What would Trump need to prove?

Trump would need to prove three major components - that the content published was factually false in a defamatory way; that he suffered harm due to the false and defamatory coverage; and that the media organisation knew it was false and acted with ""actual malice"".

Legal experts say that the BBC could show that Trump was not harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.

If Trump sues in Florida, he would need to establish that the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.

Because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of the president because of a programme they could not watch.

Mark Stephens, a solicitor at Howard Kennedy, said he thinks it is ""virtually impossible for Donald Trump to win against the BBC"".

It is ""virtually impossible"" for Trump to win against BBC, solicitor Mark Stephens tells ITV News

""Of course he can start a court case, but you've then got to have legal merit, you've got to have cogent evidence, and the programme just wasn't broadcast in America,"" he told ITV News.

""And for a libel claim to succeed even in America, harm must occur where the case is brought. So it's hard to argue reputational damage in a jurisdiction where the content wasn't aired.""

Mr Stephens added that even if a court in the US were to award a million dollars, British courts will only enforce compensatory damage for reputational loss.

He continued: ""And in this case, that's going to be no more than £100,000. So even if he gets a billion dollar judgement, it's not going to be enforced in the UK, and indeed it's not going to be economic to have brought the case.""

Trump's previous media wins

Although experts doubt the strength of his case, Trump has previously secured multimillion-dollar settlements from major US media companies, including Paramount and ABC News, over claims of misleading or inaccurate broadcasts.

He even told GB News he has had “a lot of success” litigating against news organisations.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.

Trump told GB News in an interview on Friday night: “I think that was worse than the Kamala (Harris) thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.”

That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.

Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her.",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/3w5WSaXT0LdQDvYkZ3QzxO/21e7edf9fdaf95c5fa1c863eadaff2db/trumpbbc.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80,N,,2025-11-16 09:56:27.765781

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said. ""I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.""

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

""I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,"" he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

Finally, he was allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Ali Faqirzada, 31, tapped out a message that he had passed a crucial screening, putting him on track to become a U.S. citizen.

An asylum official, he told them, had determined that he would be in danger if he returned to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where he had worked for U.S.-backed organizations and a group that supported women’s education.

But then came another text moments later: “They are detaining me.”

The circumstances of Mr. Faqirzada’s detainment by immigration officials have become increasingly common as President Trump uses more aggressive tactics to expel immigrants, including those like Mr. Faqirzada who have followed legal procedures to gain citizenship. While some immigration cases have been thrust into the limelight, tens of thousands of migrants have wound up in federal facilities and been quietly deported without their stories spilling into public view.

But Mr. Faqirzada’s detainment has led to a flurry of activity to free him, set in motion by two powerful New York institutions: Bard College and the Episcopal Diocese of New York.

Those involved see his case as particularly compelling. In their view, the country owes him for his work in Afghanistan. In the course of helping him, they say a kind of blueprint is emerging for trying to free detainees caught in the Trump administration’s crackdown: make the case visible, work every connection, don’t engage in partisan tactics.

While McLaughlin did not elaborate further on DHS's operation, the ""surge"" into Charlotte comes after federal agents have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.","Department of Homeland Security agents are ""surging"" to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Saturday, Nov. 15, to ""ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" according to department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,"" said McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement emailed to USA TODAY on Nov. 15.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" McLaughlin said. ""There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won’t.”

The arrival of federal agents comes as President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown expands to more Democratic-run cities, including Charlotte, led by Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles.

In response to DHS's efforts, the city of Charlotte's government shared a statement on Nov. 15: ""The expected U.S. Customs and Border Protection's operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.""

Additionally, the city's government said in its statement that anyone who needs ""the police, don't hesitate to call 911. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department does not participate in Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations and is not involved in the planning or execution of any federal immigration enforcement activities.""

The city also asked community members who want to make their voices heard, ""do so peacefully,"" as local officials ""do not want to see violence like many witnessed in other cities.""

What is DHS doing in Charlotte?

Before the announced deployment, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden said on Nov. 13 that federal officials had not disclosed any specific details about DHS's operation, including how many agents would be sent to the city or what their mission would entail. The sheriff added that his agency would not be ""involved with any measures regarding enforcement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP.""

Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, is a Democratic stronghold in a state that Trump won during last year's presidential election. In Mecklenburg County, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received 66% of the vote while Trump won the state by four percentage points.

Lyles, in a Nov. 13 X post, said local officials didn't know what immigration authorities were planning to do in Charlotte, but she asked residents to remain calm.

""I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community,"" Lyles said on X. ""Everyone in our community deserves to feel secure and I am committed to doing all that I can to inform our community, help make sure everyone feels safe, and understands their rights.""

According to the Charlotte Observer, ""masked federal agents"" made their presence known Saturday, Nov. 15, including at a church in east Charlotte.

“Right now, everybody is scared. Everybody,” the church's pastor, who did not want to identify himself to the outlet, said. “One of these guys with immigration, he say he was going to arrest one of the other guys in the church. He pushed him.”

Which other cities have federal agents been deployed to?

While McLaughlin did not elaborate further on DHS's operation, the ""surge"" into Charlotte comes after federal agents have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland. The deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops have been challenged in court and have drawn criticism over officers' use of force and what's been seen as increasingly aggressive tactics by the Trump administration.

Late last month, Trump threatened to send “more than the National Guard” to ""troubled"" U.S. cities. At the time, he didn't identify which cities he intended to send troops to.

“We’re sending in our National Guard and if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard because we’re going to have safe cities,” Trump said Oct. 28 at a U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, during his weeklong Asia trip. “We’re not going to have people killed in our cities. Whether people like that or not, that’s what we’re doing.""

While Lyles and other city officials are in opposition to the DHS's operation, Congressman Tim Moore, a Republican who represents a district outside Charlotte, said he has ""full confidence in our federal law enforcement partners and appreciates their ongoing work to uphold the rule of law and protect the people of North Carolina.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/15/USAT/87296915007-20251017-t-234555-z-1343128707-rc-2-d-4-haghq-9-s-rtrmadp-3-usaicechicago.JPG?crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&width=2975&height=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-16 00:56:32.593659

The statement from BCSO comes after Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer released a statement saying that Asheville 'may be a targeted city'.

Manheimer's statement on ICE and Border Patrol referenced Governor Josh Stein's statement talking about the possibility of ICE and Border Patrol agents coming to North Carolina, saying in part, ""As this situation develops, I will continue to stay in touch with local and state officials to keep people safe, respect the rule of law, and support our people.""

""A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,'” Falk explained to Al-Jazeera in a Saturday interview from Ottawa in the wake of the incident that happened at the international airport in Toronto ahead of the scheduled event.
He told media outlets that he and his wife, also an American, were held for over four hours after their arrival in Toronto.
Clearly, the international repression of the Palestinian cause knows no bounds.""
Canadian Senator Yuen Pau Woo, a supporter of the Palestine Tribunal, told Al-Jazeera he was “appalled” by the interrogation.","Ninety-five-year-old Richard Falk—world renowned scholar of international law and former UN special rapporteur focused on Palestinian rights—was detained and interrogated for several hours along with his wife, legal scholar Hilal Elver, as the pair entered Canada for a conference focused on that nation's complicity with Israel's genocide in Gaza.

""A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,'” Falk explained to Al-Jazeera in a Saturday interview from Ottawa in the wake of the incident that happened at the international airport in Toronto ahead of the scheduled event.

“It was my first experience of this sort–ever–in my life,” said Falk, professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, author or editor of more than 20 books, and formerly the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories.

Falk, who is American, has been an outspoken critic of the foreign policy of Canada, the United States, and other Western nations on the subject of Israel-Palestine as well as other issues. He told media outlets that he and his wife, also an American, were held for over four hours after their arrival in Toronto. They were in the country to speak and participate at the Palestine Tribunal on Canadian Responsibility, an event scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Ottawa, the nation's capital.

The event, according to the program notes on the website, was designed to ""document the multiple ways that Canadian entities – including government bodies, corporations, universities, charities, media, and other cultural institutions–have enabled and continue to enable the settler colonization and genocide of Palestinians, and to articulate what justice and reparations would require.""

In his comments to Al-Jazeera, Falk said he believes the interrogation by the Canadian authorities—which he described as ""nothing particularly aggressive"" but ""random"" and ""disorganized"" in its execution—is part of a global effort by powerful nations complicit with human rights abuses and violations of international law to “punish those who endeavour to tell the truth about what is happening” in the world, including in Gaza.

Martin Shaw, a British sociologist and author of The New Age of Genocide, said the treatment of Falk and Elver should be seen as an ""extraordinary development"" for Canada, and not in a good way. For a nation that likes to think of itself as a ""supporter of international justice,"" said Shaw, ""to arrest the veteran scholar and former UN rapporteur Richard Falk while he is attending a Gaza tribunal. Clearly, the international repression of the Palestinian cause knows no bounds.""

It remains unclear how DHS' departure from Naval Station Great Lakes will impact the ongoing immigration crackdown.

In recent days, there have been signs the federal immigration surge may be slowing down in Chicago.

Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino left the city, and on Saturday, federal officials confirmed immigration enforcement had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In an interview on Fox News on Thursday, the Border Patrol commander said he was in West Virginia.

Two days ahead of Bovino's departure from Chicago, a spokesperson challenged reporting from multiple outlets that he and numerous federal agents were preparing to leave the city.

Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for Homeland Security, disputed reports that operations would be wound down in Chicago in a social media post.

“We aren’t leaving Chicago,” she said, not referring to Bovino by name. She made similar remarks on Fox News Tuesday.

McLaughlin cited statistics showing crime had decreased in the city during the ramped-up federal intervention, but it was unclear how those statistics were calculated.

She reported the following since the start of Operation Midway Blitz:

Homicides down 16%

Shootings down 35%

Robberies down 41%

Carjackings down 48%

Transit crime down 20%

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office blasted the statistics cited by McLaughlin in her social media post, calling the assertion that DHS has helped lower crime rates “a slap in the face” to Chicago police.

According to data provided by Chicago police, homicides were down 29% year-over-year in the city. Robberies were down 35% year-over-year, motor vehicle thefts dropped by 23%, and shootings decreased by 36%.

Thousands of arrests were reported during the federal operation in Chicago, which has sparked multiple court challenges.

What are they (Border Patrol) here for?”","Following the arrival of the U.S. Border Patrol in Charlotte Saturday morning, hundreds of protesters gathered at First Ward Park in the afternoon and marched through uptown, delivering a clear message to federal agents: “Get out.”

Rosa Ramirez attended the emergency protest with her mother, Martha Ramirez, who held a sign saying, “Stop kidnapping our neighbors.” There have been many reports around the Charlotte region of federal police — their identities shielded with masks and license plates covered — detaining people.

“They’ve been doing terrible things in Chicago, and we’re not happy that they’re bringing it here to North Carolina,” Martha Ramirez said.

As the daughter of a father from the Dominican Republic, Rosa Ramirez said she feels that the immigrant community is being racially profiled, especially after hearing about a U.S. citizen in Charlotte who was pulled out of his truck after agents broke the window.

“None of us have any real feeling of safety,” Rosa Ramirez said. “I’m here to use my voice and to use the rights that I hopefully still have to defend those who don’t have their papers and documents at this moment.”

The U.S. Border Patrol has not disclosed how many agents were sent from Chicago to the city, nor how long they intend to remain. Their activities began in the morning, but it’s unclear which federal other agencies are involved in this operation.

In recent developments, at least 200 U.S. Border Patrol agents were stationed in Chicago, assisting the Trump Administration’s efforts to address illegal immigration.

Since September, the agency reports arresting 1,500 individuals, according to CBS News. Federal agents have made arrests across Chicago and surrounding suburbs, questioning residents and, at times, using tear gas on both civilians and local law enforcement.

“Immigrants are an integral part of our community and our workforce,” Martha Ramirez said, noting labor needs and contributions such as helping western North Carolina rebuild after Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters. She said she believes migration is a human right.

“We should be welcoming those folks here, and those folks aren’t asking for anything but the privilege to work and to contribute to our economy in the same way that any other American citizen does,” she said.

Community organizations led protesters with loud chants against Border Patrol agents being in Charlotte. Some of the participating organizations included Seeking Justice, Poor People’s Campaign, Housing Justice Coalition, Blakk Liberation, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

Kass Ottley of Seeking Justice said she liked seeing the large crowd but encouraged more people in the region to get involved and push racial differences aside.

“We have to come together,” she said. “That’s the only way we’re going to win.”

Joel Simpson of the Poor People’s Campaign spoke against the Trump Administration’s budget boosts for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said that money could go towards other needs, such as healthcare or food programs to help people.

“We know that this is an attack on people’s dignity and humanity,” Simpson said. “It’s an attack on our constitutional rights, and we won’t be silent about it.”

Alison Yanez and her sister, Danna Yanez, said they’re not going to be quiet either. Their family came to America from Honduras for a better life.

“I feel bad for the families that fear coming out to the streets and speaking for themselves,” Alison Yanez said. “I’m here today to speak for those who can’t.”

“They’re just grabbing people out of their cars ... they’re just harassing them,” Danna Yanez said about the treatment. “But we’re all humans, and we’re all on stolen land.

Federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington’s immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff’s office had ""zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations.""

The impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement.

GOP URGES DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TO CHARLOTTE AS CRIME SURGES

Charlotte’s anticipated CBP deployment is the latest in a series of similar moves by the federal government to extend border-security operations to other parts of the country.

In recent months, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have sent personnel to major metropolitan areas including Chicago and Washington, D.C.

Those operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents.

WATCH: Federal immigration agents dodge bullets, speeding cars in CA

Federal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.""

Local pressures mount

The timing of the announcement comes as Charlotte faces intensifying scrutiny over violent crime.

Homicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility.

""Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,"" a letter from a trio of Republican lawmakers said. ""According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.""

MAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK

According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte’s current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.

On Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. The footage captured the 23-year-old cowering as her alleged killer leered over her with a folding knife seconds before the attack.

Police revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet.

'Committed to transparency'

In his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office ""remains committed to transparency"" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.""

""We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,"" the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw ""a lot of Latinos running,"" chased by ""a lot of Border Patrol agents.""

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,'"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the ""significant border patrol activity"" was seen Saturday.

""Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them 'fishing,'"" Asciutto said.

Encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton's front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

""This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we've got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They've broken no laws, and that's what concerns me,"" said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

""It's an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,"" the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

""Half an hour later, he's in our yard, he's working and Border Patrol rolls up,"" she said. ""They're here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there's just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.""

Some businesses close

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

""This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?"" he said. ""This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.""

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and ""We're brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don't know how long this is going to last.""

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials ""have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order"" and are ""demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.""

""Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.""

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any ""inappropriate behavior"" and notify local law enforcement.

Home secretary Shabana Mahmood will indicate a move away from EU law as she announces plans to scrap the UK’s statutory duty to provide support to asylum seekers – with migrants also facing stricter requirements to receive and retain benefits.

It is part of a major overhaul of the immigration system, inspired by the Danish model, and comes as Labour battles to restore public trust in the asylum system to see off the threat of a Reform UK government. But Ms Mahmood may face objections from some Labour backbenchers, with immigration reform seen as a divisive issue within the party.

Ahead of a speech by the home secretary laying out the reforms on Monday, the Home Office said that support will “no longer be a given” for asylum seekers, vowing that automatic handouts for those seeking refuge “will end”.

The announcement is being billed by the government as the largest overhaul of asylum policy in modern times and a move to “restore order” to the rules.

Ministers hope it will reduce the incentive for small boat migrants to claim refuge in the UK, with Home Office officials insisting Britain will no longer be a “magnet for illegal migrants” seeking to benefit.

Outlining her changes, Ms Mahmood said the “pace and scale of migration” is putting “immense pressure” on communities.

She said: “This country has a proud tradition of welcoming those fleeing danger, but our generosity is drawing illegal migrants across the channel.

“The pace and scale of migration is placing immense pressure on communities.

“This week I will set out the most sweeping changes to our asylum system in a generation. We will restore order and control to our borders.”

The legal duty to provide asylum-seeking support was introduced in the UK in 2005 under EU law.

Currently, support includes the right to somewhere to live, as well as a weekly payment of £49.18 per person in each household to cover costs of items such as food, clothing and toiletries. If the accommodation provides meals, each person gets £9.95 per week instead. There are small increases for pregnant women and young children.

Under Ms Mahmood’s plans, those who can work, have assets, fail to comply with removal directions, engage in criminality, disrupt accommodation settings or work illegally could have their support removed, the Home Office said.

The changes are set to apply to people who are already in the asylum support system, as well as anybody who arrives and applies in the future – meaning those already in the UK could have their support taken away.

Meanwhile, officials have also said that taxpayer-funded benefits will be prioritised for people who are “making a contribution to the economy and communities”.

Among the changes expected to be unveiled on Monday is a move requiring judges to prioritise public safety over a migrant’s right to a family life, as well as a push to scrap permanent asylum in Britain.

Under current rules, those granted refugee status can apply for indefinite leave to remain and have refugee status for five years. But, under the expected proposals, refugees will be removed as soon as their home country is deemed safe.

It comes after officials in the Home Office visited Copenhagen as part of their attempts to learn about Denmark’s asylum policy, where a strict asylum approach has been taken by a government with similar political alignment to the Labour Party.

The country is also a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been criticised in the past for blocking or slowing efforts to deport illegal migrants.

The Scandinavian country has reduced the number of asylum applications to their lowest level in 40 years, and removed 95 per cent of rejected asylum seekers, according to the Home Office.

The Tories have said that some of the new measures are “welcome” but they “stop well short of what is really required and some are just yet more gimmicks – like the previous ‘smash the gangs’ gimmick”.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: “The truth is this Labour government is incapable of getting any real change past their left-wing backbenchers, especially after the weak example they set with the debacle of their botched welfare reforms.”

Labour is coming under pressure on immigration as Reform’s poll numbers continue to surge.

Nigel Farage’s party is sitting at 26 per cent in the latest YouGov Westminster voting intention figures from this week, with Labour lagging behind on 19 per cent, just ahead of the Tories on 18 per cent.

This is the latest in a series of crackdowns, including the immigration white paper earlier this year, designed to slash legal migration.

Under those plans announced in May, legal migrants will have to spend 10 years in the UK before applying for citizenship, and language requirements will be upped for all routed into the UK.

The number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high, as the latest Home Office figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the year to June 2025.

This is the highest number for any 12 months since records began in 2001.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/17/PA-82143799.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-15 19:56:49.428217

The risks to America’s global pre-eminence get less attention than Trump’s White House ballroom, the government shutdown and his ugly statements about his opponents.","What’s the secret formula that has made the United States the dominant superpower in the world today?

I’d point to three fundamental ingredients, each of which is now being weakened. When I think of the historical legacies of our generation and of President Trump, I wonder if they will be less about the political battles in the headlines and more about the slow shriveling of America’s global standing.

Patriotism is less about waving flags and more about defending these three forces that over two centuries have made America pre-eminent:

A commitment to education at every level, resulting in global leadership in science and technology.

I believe the answer to almost every question is education — the highest-return long-term investments are often in human capital. Yet throughout the ages there have always been those eager to execute Socrates, to subject Galileo to the Inquisition, to ban books.

America became the world’s leading nation largely because of its emphasis beginning in the 19th century on mass education when other countries educated only a sliver of elites, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz argued in their landmark 2008 book, “The Race Between Education and Technology.”

The United States helped pioneer public elementary schools and widespread high school and college attendance; later, American research universities became global leaders and nurtured technology hubs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Thus the United States boasts the Magnificent Seven technology companies, while there isn’t anything comparable in Europe. America’s scientific and technological excellence arises in part because of a symbiotic partnership between universities, the federal agencies that fund research and the private companies that commercialize that knowledge.

America’s educational supremacy arguably began slipping decades ago, as some East Asian countries eclipsed us in high school graduation rates and in science and math skills among young people. But Trump is adding to the pressure by gutting the Department of Education, including research and data collection that show how we can improve outcomes. Even worse, he is waging war on America’s most eminent universities.

American excellence in science drives economic competitiveness and well-being. Yet Trump is winding down mRNA vaccine programs that are full of promise in tackling cancer and has slashed investments in medical research.

Any president should be proud of universities like Harvard and Columbia, not attempt to crush them. We stand up to China with not only aircraft carriers but, even more, by educating our own young people and leading in research in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and materials science. Yet by some reckonings, China has already surpassed the United States in emerging technologies.

So we should be doing what we did after Sputnik in 1957, recommitting this country to science and education. Instead, the Trump administration’s hostility to great universities seems to reflect a larger scorn for science in fields from vaccines to climate change. It is the latest flowering of an anti-intellectualism that goes back to China’s first Qin emperor burying scholars alive and, in this country, to the Scopes trial, the Joseph McCarthy hysteria and the 2017 tax on university endowments.

An inclination toward free markets and free trade, supported by the rule of law.

This is the pillar that Trump is most respectful of. He mostly believes in capitalism and free markets — probably more than many Democrats — but has led a rapid retreat from free trade. His tariffs are the highest since the 1930s. Trump has also systematically chipped away at some of the underpinnings of a market economy. Markets thrive with prudent fiscal and monetary management, yet his tax cuts lead to soaring debt even as he tries to crush the independence of the Federal Reserve. Corruption is a bane of capitalism, yet his family has seemed to use the presidency as an A.T.M.

And the rule of law? England was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution partly because of a legal system that offered protection and predictability. In contrast, Trump has periodically defied lower courts and used the Department of Justice to punish his political opponents. Mark L. Wolf, a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan, announced this month that he was resigning to be able to speak openly about the Trump administration’s “assault on the rule of law” and the way that it poses an “existential threat to democracy.”

Immigration and the absorption of some of the brightest minds from around the world.

My dad, an Armenian refugee from Eastern Europe, arrived in the United States in 1952. Soon after, his landlady returned his rent, saying, “I can’t take money from a refugee.”

Such a welcoming spirit, while far from consistently applied, has enormously enriched the United States. Four of the Magnificent Seven tech companies are led by immigrants, and 46 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, according to the American Immigration Council.

These three factors are not a complete recipe for America’s greatness. The sheer physical size of our domestic market helped, along with democracy and the ease of interstate commerce. And even on those three, we’ve repeatedly fallen short.

Yet I see these three factors as central to America’s rise as the world’s leading power today. And these strengths are now being systematically undermined, especially universities, trade, the rule of law and recruitment of the world’s best minds.

The risks to America’s global pre-eminence get less attention than Trump’s White House ballroom, the government shutdown and his ugly statements about his opponents. But I’d argue that his most important legacy may be the damage he is doing to the underpinnings of our economic engines.

The Nobel in economic science went this year to three scholars who illuminated how innovation drives economic growth. They emphasized that this arises from immigration, from great universities, from openness to the world and to ideas — and consequently warned of “dark clouds” ahead.

Throughout history, we’ve repeatedly seen how great nations sometimes lost their energy and drive, slipping because of what Jawaharlal Nehru described in the context of India as a “gradual oozing out of hope and vitality.” In the year 1000, the greatest city in the world was Kaifeng in China, then the most important country in the world — but China and Kaifeng then lost ground for most of the next millennium before reviving in recent decades.

The United States may or may not experience such decrepitude, but decline seems to me more likely if America chokes trade and immigration while stifling universities.

(AP/WNCN) — Federal officials confirmed that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations Saturday.

“We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Local officials, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

“We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” said the statement, which was also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Stephanie Sneed of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg education board.

The federal government hadn’t previously announced the push. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.”

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

“I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,” he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ’I’m an American citizen,” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

Finally he was allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Local organizations responded by having trainings, trying to inform immigrants of their rights, and considering peaceful protests. President Donald Trump’s administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

But Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the “vast majority” of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”

He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” they see and notify local law enforcement about it.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasized ahead of time that it isn’t involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Mayor of Charlotte Vi Lyles, Board of County Commissioners Chair Mark Jerrell, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education Chair Stephanie Sneed issued a combined statement amid reports the border patrol was focusing on Charlotte, according to WJZY.

Our organizations believe that our diversity makes us stronger. And with that belief we are unwavering in our commitment to a safe and welcoming community where everyone can grow and thrive. It is critical for all residents to feel secure in our community and know they can live their lives without being fearful while walking down the street, going to school, work or the grocery store.

The expected U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (commonly called “Border Patrol”) operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.

We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives, contributing to our larger community. Each of our organizations have made commitments to the people we serve to protect their rights and dignity. We are committed to following the law and to protecting the rights of all people who call Charlotte and Mecklenburg County home.

It is important for people to understand their rights. There are a number of organizations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters and if anyone has questions about their immigration status or rights, please reach out to those organizations.

If you need the police, don’t hesitate to call 911. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) does not participate in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations and is not involved in the planning or execution of any federal immigration enforcement activities. We know many of you want to speak out and make your voices heard — and that’s your right.

We ask that, as a community, we do so peacefully. We do not want to see violence like many witnessed in other cities. We can stand up for what we believe in without resorting to violence. Our region has thrived and grown because our strength lies in our diversity and our collective commitment to each other and to this community. Let us all — no matter our political allegiance – stand together for all hard working and law-abiding families.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/11/AP25319730858059.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 19:57:03.187920

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Federal officials confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement that they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

“We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ‘I’m an American citizen,’” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.

“Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,’” Asciutto said.

An encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

“This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

“It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

“Half an hour later, he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”

Some businesses close

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

“This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.”

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We’re brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don’t know how long this is going to last.”

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”

“Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Participants said at least seven of those arrested were faith leaders from Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Unitarian Universalist and Jewish traditions.
Sinks said faith leaders began Nov. 14 with a multifaith service outside the Broadview facility to ""bear witness to the suffering inside the facility.""
Several faith leaders at the demonstration expressed shock at the intensity of the police response.
Faith leaders were brutalized today for wanting to offer spiritual care to their stolen neighbors.","In video recorded on Nov. 14 outside the embattled U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, the Rev. Michael Woolf stands alongside fellow protesters, fiddling awkwardly with his backpack as faith leaders and other protesters chant slogans at a line of police officers. A moment later, one officer can be seen walking forward, grabbing Woolf by the wrist and yanking.

Demonstrators attempted to hold on to Woolf, who was wearing a clerical collar, but four officers wrenched him from the crowd and tossed him to the ground. After turning him onto his stomach, officers proceeded to arrest Woolf, and removed him to the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Maywood, Illinois.

""I've got bruises all over my body,"" Woolf, an American Baptist minister who is pastor of Lake Street Church of Evanston, Illinois, told Religion News Service. He was speaking in his first interview since being released Nov. 14 afternoon after about seven hours in custody.

Woolf said when he asked the arresting officers to loosen the plastic handcuffs that were causing his hands to go numb, an officer replied: ""Nobody wants to talk to you — shut the f–k up.""

""It's part of the dehumanizing nature of it, and it gives me a lot of clarity around what's happening here,"" said Woolf, who has been active in protests against ICE. ""It's really a spiritual emergency.""

Footage and images of Woolf's arrest were shared widely on the Internet, drawing attention to the demonstration at the ICE facility, where protests have become commonplace in recent weeks. Organizers said at least 100 faith leaders of various faiths and denominations came to the Broadview facility, highlighting religious pushback to ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" a mass deportation effort that has rounded up hundreds of undocumented immigrants and other Chicago residents since it was launched in September.

Cook County Police said 21 people were arrested at the demonstration, all but one of whom were charged with ""Obstruction/Disorderly Conduct/Pedestrian Walking on Highways."" Participants said at least seven of those arrested were faith leaders from Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Unitarian Universalist and Jewish traditions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not reply immediately to a request for comment, but on Nov. 14 a post on the department’s X feed seemed to mock the protest participants, saying, ""Womp womp, cry all you want. These criminal illegal aliens aren't getting released,"" the post read.

The post called the demonstrators ""violent rioters"" and ""imbecilic morons"" who need to ""get a job.""

Asked about the DHS statement, Woolf said he and other protesters were ""demanding constitutional and due process rights"" for detainees, adding, ""I believe that justice will come in this life or the next.""

""I know which side I choose. I choose the Gospel,"" he added.

""This is our job,"" said the Rev. Kristina Sinks, a United Methodist pastor who helped organize a worship service, in reply to the DHS post. Sinks also rejected the suggestion that demonstrators were violent. She later explained via text message that she believes it is the job of clergy to ""advocate for the oppressed, the vulnerable, and those dehumanized by any forces of evil and oppression.""

Sinks added: ""Why does DHS feel threatened by clergy praying? What are they hiding?""

Organizers called the protest one of the largest in a series of demonstrations at the Broadview site, many of which have been led by religious leaders, who say that federal authorities are mistreating the detainees at the facility. The treatment of the detainees is the subject of an ongoing class-action lawsuit.

Sinks said faith leaders began Nov. 14 with a multifaith service outside the Broadview facility to ""bear witness to the suffering inside the facility."" The participants held daily hygiene products, bread and clean water to ""symbolize needs not met"" by the government agents who run the facility.

Faith leaders from various traditions — Christian, Jewish, Hindu and others — then presented police with a letter from clergy offering spiritual care to the detainees. Organizers, Sinks said, sent DHS an identical letter a week earlier.

Offers of pastoral care and Communion for detainees at the facility have been offered multiple times, only to be rebuffed. Religious leaders have raised the issue as a religious freedom concern. U.S. Catholic bishops on Nov. 12 approved a ""special pastoral message on immigration"" that expresses their collective solidarity with immigrants amid the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics. On Nov. 4 Pope Leo XIV criticized immigration authorities who refused to let clergy administer Communion to migrants at the detention facility near Chicago.

After clergy were denied access again Nov. 14, video footage from the protest posted on social media showed Woolf and other faith leaders attempting to approach the facility, marching arm-in-arm. The demonstrators were quickly mobbed by police, who began pushing them back. A short time later, police began arresting demonstrators.

Several faith leaders at the demonstration expressed shock at the intensity of the police response. The Rev. Quincy Worthington, a Presbyterian Church (USA) minister who has been active in protests against ICE and was in the crowd Nov. 14, said he tried to help up people who had fallen or pushed down who were ""being crushed or beaten.""

Similarly, the Rev. Hannah Kardon, a United Methodist minister who had been thrown to the ground and arrested at a previous demonstration in Broadview, said in a text message that she saw ""overwhelming and unnecessary violence"" from ""multiple police forces"" at the facility.

""I saw knees on necks,"" she wrote. ""I saw people pulled and dragged. I saw people slammed to the ground. Faith leaders were brutalized today for wanting to offer spiritual care to their stolen neighbors. It was horrific.""

Clergy have been vocal critics of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" since it began and said they have repeatedly been met with force by federal, state and local police forces. At least five local clergy, including Woolf, Kardon and Worthington, say DHS forces have shot them with pepper balls. Footage of agents shooting the Rev. David Black, a Presbyterian minister from Chicago, in the head with pepper balls was widely shared on social media.

As state and local police have become the main force guarding the facility in recent weeks, activists have accused Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a critic of Trump and his mass deportation policies, of protecting ICE agents.

The treatment of faith-based protesters is part of the class-action lawsuit as well as a separate case that includes Black as a plaintiff. The latter case resulted in a temporary restraining order limiting federal agents' ability to use violence against protesters, including “religious practitioners.”

Woolf said that after he was arrested, he and other participants continued to pray and worship during the hours they were detained together. They sang songs such as ""We Shall Overcome,"" and some recited poetry.

The pastor added he has been reflecting on ""the dehumanizing nature"" of his experience, but that ""the cruelty that goes on [at] that facility … must be 100 times worse.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/11.15.25%20Rev%20Woolf%20arrested.png?h=a7f9be62&itok=37TSyw0-,N,,2025-11-15 20:57:50.016197

Great Lakes Naval Station was providing support for DHS operations in the Chicago area for the last two months or so, during which time federal immigration agents were engaged in Operation Midway Blitz.

DHS claimed on Friday that more than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the Chicago area during the operation.

City of North Chicago officials were informed of the closure late Friday afternoon, according to Gregory Jackson, the chief of staff to the city’s mayor.

A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the reported closure.

The backstory:

This comes as DHS has denied reports in recent days of it winding down Operation Midway Blitz and sending agents to other cities.

In response to a Chicago Tribune report that Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and his team were being reassigned, a DHS spokesperson said, ""We aren’t leaving Chicago.""

It’s unclear exactly what the command center’s closure means for immigration operations in the Chicago area more broadly.

Still, on Friday, The Associated Press reported that officials in Charlotte, North Carolina, were preparing for the arrival of Border Patrol agents and immigration sweeps.

In response to a North Carolina congresswoman's statement on her concern over Border Patrol coming to Charlotte, Bovino responded on X referring to operations in Chicago in the past tense.

Kupor said most of those additions have gone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), noting that the agency’s rapid expansion has been one of the clearest indicators of the administration’s enforcement-driven approach.

The hiring surge is unfolding alongside the president’s broader effort to reshape the federal workforce, even as his administration moves to trim positions in other departments. “It’s about reshaping the workforce to focus on the priorities that we think are most important,” Kupor said.

Officials have carried out the buildup even as a hiring freeze and job cuts hit other corners of the federal bureaucracy, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.

Kupor noted that the workforce overhaul is far from over, saying in August that the administration anticipates trimming roughly 300,000 federal positions by the end of the year.

Earlier this year, Trump tapped billionaire Elon Musk to spearhead a sweeping downsizing initiative aimed at the 2.4-million-person civilian workforce. With the president’s support, Musk has argued that federal agencies have grown bloated and sluggish, and need a dramatic overhaul to function efficiently.

In practice, that restructuring has meant cuts across agencies responsible for civil rights enforcement, tax collection, and federal clean-energy initiatives, as the administration redirects resources toward its own priorities.

As the cuts accelerated, roughly 154,000 federal workers opted to take buyouts offered by the administration. Those departures stretched across agencies that handle everything from weather forecasting and food safety to public health programs and space operations, according to former officials and union representatives who spoke with Reuters earlier this year.

Overall, the combination of targeted hiring in security agencies and deep cuts across civilian departments has set the stage for a sweeping remake of the federal workforce. The administration maintains that shifting personnel toward border enforcement and defence will bolster national strength, but the breadth of reductions in everyday public functions has raised concerns among former officials and labor groups about lasting disruptions.

With tens of thousands taking buyouts and far more departures expected by year’s end, the government is undergoing an unusually rapid overhaul, supporters champion as long-needed reform and critics argue could hollow out essential operations. Whether agencies can adapt to these sharp changes, and whether the administration’s promised efficiencies materialize, will determine how well the federal government can meet the country’s needs in the years ahead.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US-ICE.png,N,,2025-11-15 17:57:07.251538

“Will the ICE agents be at school today?” her daughter, whose father is Indian, recently asked.","When Chris arrived at his childrens’ day-care center on November 5, he immediately sensed that something was wrong. There were more cars in the parking lot than usual, and when he walked into the Spanish immersion school, a visibly shocked parent told him that “ICE agents just came in and took Miss Diana.” Around 7 a.m. on Chicago’s North Side, Diana Santillana Galeano had been dragged out of Rayito de Sol and handcuffed in front of parents and their children. By the time Chris arrived 15 minutes later, many of the day-care workers were either crying or hiding, some in the classrooms and others in the back of a pickup truck, terrified that ICE officers might come back. Chris’s 3-year-old son held his hand and looked up at his father with a quivering lip. “Seeing your teachers cry is confusing,” he says. “His little sad face broke my heart.”

When Chris (who asked to use a pseudonym because of his job) called his wife, Erin, to tell her the news, she was shocked. Santillana Galeano is the kind of teacher who celebrates each child’s milestones, she says, and had been so excited when their 1-year-old son recently started to walk. Then came the detention. “In that moment, she went from being this person who is kind and nurturing,” she says, “to someone being handcuffed in front of her co-workers and treated like a threat.”

Local journalists showed up on the scene, and a few hours later, a video of the arrest shot by a parent was circulating on social media. In it, Santillana Galeano screams and says “I have papers” in Spanish as the ICE officers pin her against a car. Even though school officials showed the agents her employment documents, according to the Washington Post, Santillana Galeano was taken away to a detention center.

Santillana Galeano fled Colombia in 2023 owing to safety threats, according to legal filings. She filed for asylum and was granted employment authorization until November 2029. But the Department of Homeland Security argued that the Biden administration exploited a “loophole” to approve her work status and claimed she paid a smuggler to bring her teenagers across the border into Texas last year. Homeland Security also maintained that officers tried to pull her over at a traffic stop before she went into the day care. Under Biden, ICE agents weren’t allowed to enter schools in most scenarios, a policy that Trump reversed as part of his larger immigration crackdown. This summer, the government launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in the Chicago area, which has led to more than 3,000 arrests and a string of horrific stories, including ICE agents killing a man, pepper-spraying a 1-year-old girl, and throwing flash-bang grenades during a raid on an apartment building.

On the day of Santillana Galeano’s arrest, local lawmakers held a press conference to condemn ICE’s actions, and parents in the day care’s neighborhood, some of whom are lawyers, began to mobilize. “We dropped everything,” says Aimee Karstens, whose 16-month-old son goes to Rayito de Sol. “Everyone used whatever resources they had.” While the day care shut down for the rest of the week, a group of almost 30 mothers on a text thread called “Mami’s de Rayito” found Santillana Galeano legal support, set up a GoFundMe that has since raised close to $160,000, called local politicians, and coordinated a meal train for the other day-care workers who were frightened by their colleague’s arrest. (A few days later, a different group of moms from Chicago’s suburbs got arrested while protesting outside the detention facility where Santillana Galeano was being held.) The Rayito parents also scrambled for child care; one mother, who has an in-person job, said her husband took meetings while looking after their 4-month-old baby and letting their 4-year-old watch TV.

In between making T-shirts that say “No Hate, No Fear, Everyone Is Welcome Here” and organizing rallies, parents were figuring out how to talk with their children about what had happened. Over the weekend, after passing a tree decorated with lights, Erin’s 4-year-old son asked, “What if Miss Diana isn’t back in time for Christmas?” “He knows that ICE took Miss Diana, but his brain is still so tiny,” she says. “There’s no playbook for this.” She and the other moms are struggling to explain the incident to their kids. “There was a gun in my child’s school,” says Karstens. “It just unravels this feeling of security and safety and trust that you have.” She is now worried that her Spanish au pair could be arrested at day-care pickup or while playing in the park with her two sons. Another Rayito mom’s 4-year-old is already afraid of ICE agents and clutches her arm while walking around the neighborhood. “Will the ICE agents be at school today?” her daughter, whose father is Indian, recently asked. “Why are they arresting Latinos?” The mother tells her, “‘Your teacher will keep you safe. Mommy and Daddy will keep you safe.’ But I don’t even feel like I can promise that.”

Monday, the first day Rayito Del Sol opened its doors after the arrest, was an emotional one. Erin spoke with Santillana Galeano’s closest co-worker, who put on a smile for all of the children in spite of her red eyes. “I just instantly started crying because this is where it happened,” says Erin. “The teachers were brave enough to show up for our children.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdc/582/2cb94b5c6a0fb3c83ca8ac6aa1592e2c36-rayito-de-sol-2.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 18:56:46.644049

These factors are emboldening ICE agents and “things are escalating seemingly every day with many different people impacted,” he said.

I’m very proud of how community members, community organizers, and of course, my organizations have stood up in defense of our people.”","When the Supreme Court overturned a temporary restraining order in September that kept U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials from questioning and detaining people based on their language, skin color, or occupation — effectively clearing the way for racial profiling — Guadalupe Cardona was not surprised.

Cardona is a member of Unión del Barrio, a national organization that has led resistance efforts against ICE and police violence since its inception in 1981.

Since the Trump administration took office — but especially in recent months — she has witnessed daily scenes of ICE snatching primarily Latino people off the streets and detaining them without identifying themselves or giving due process. When the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to expand ICE’s use of racial profiling, Cardona knew it would empower ICE agents to ramp up their raids and kidnappings of community members even further.

“The communities that are being attacked are people who are keeping the world going, producing goods and foods, building things and providing services and doing all the things that are necessary in order for this nation to flourish and continue,” Cardona said.

To Reyna Montoya, founder and CEO of Aliento, an organization that works in Arizona to support immigrant families and Dreamers who came to the U.S. at a young age, the Supreme Court’s order greenlighting ICE’s racial profiling echoed a reality that people in her state had already lived through: the legalization of racial profiling by law enforcement in order to detain individuals they believed to be immigrants under SB 1070. During this time, from its implementation in 2010 to a settlement stripping several provisions in 2016, Black and Brown communities lived in fear, she said.

When it was passed in 2010, SB 1070 was one of the harshest anti-immigrant laws in the country. Among other measures, it deputized law enforcement to carry out immigration enforcement by determining the immigration status of anyone they deemed suspicious — even U.S. citizens. Montoya says the law also emboldened people who already had racist ideas. She recalled getting “dirty looks” while speaking Spanish at a supermarket with her mother.

In another instance, Montoya told Truthout, an intern who worked with Aliento at the time said that her father was pulled over, even though he was an authorized resident, because he was Brown. She also heard that people in Latino communities were not reporting crimes — from domestic violence to shoplifting — because they did not trust law enforcement.

“These were stories that I grew up listening to at that time,” 34-year-old Montoya said.

The impacts of legalized racial profiling rippled out to the mental health of Arizona’s young people. Cesar Escalante, a researcher at the University of Georgia, found that during the period SB 1070 was in place, youth in Arizona faced isolation, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders due to the stress of either being undocumented or being assumed to be undocumented.

“Young [Latino] people who went to school, especially middle school and high school … were subjected to a lot of ostracism, labeling, and bullying,” Escalante said.

However, communities mobilized against the law, holding protests and boycotts across Arizona. Two years after the measure passed, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to make it a crime if people failed to carry documentation to prove their immigration status and to outlaw police from arresting someone for believing them to be deportable. Further provisions to the law were stripped in 2016 when Arizona’s then attorney general banned law enforcement from prolonging a stop based on immigration status, although the rule about allowing law enforcement to inquire about immigration status still lingers.

Montoya is worried that history is repeating itself — only now it will be across the country, not just in Arizona.

“It is heartbreaking,” Montoya said. “Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be increased discrimination among the Latino community, among other communities that may appear to look Latino.”

“A Recipe for Disaster”

The Supreme Court’s decision to greenlight ICE’s racial profiling in September came in response to a lower court decision in California, Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, that attempted to ban the use of racial profiling and roving patrols of ICE agents to detain people. In response to an “emergency request” from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court issued a quick order that overturned the ban, allowing ICE agents to arrest anyone they might deem to be an immigrant based on their language or skin color, without identifying themselves. In legal circles, these are now dubbed “Kavanaugh stops” after the Supreme Court justice claimed that legal residents are only briefly stopped and not arrested, despite lawsuits proving otherwise.

As the American Immigration Council noted at that time: “Crucially, this order is not a final ruling, but it strongly signals the Supreme Court will not uphold strict constitutional limits on the authority of immigration agents to stop and question people they suspect to be immigrants.”

Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, said the Supreme Court’s recent decision is enormously consequential and could result in even more aggressive immigration raids across the country. Although he anticipates more litigation on this issue, the court’s decision could still take years to overturn — during which a lot of damage could be done, he said.

Since Donald Trump began his second term in office, more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, reporting from ProPublica has found; the government does not track the number of citizens held by immigration agents, so the count could well exceed that number. Loweree is concerned that the ruling could worsen this threat.

“If we live in an environment where ICE can target people based on the way that they look, including U.S. citizens, that’s a situation where no one in this country is safe from this sort of action,” Loweree said.

Loweree also noted that ICE is cutting corners during background checks of onboarding officers. These factors are emboldening ICE agents and “things are escalating seemingly every day with many different people impacted,” he said.

“All of this is a recipe for disaster, for some very ugly, negative outcomes impacting many people across the country, and it’s all something that was facilitated by the Supreme Court.”

“You’re Not Gonna Get Rid of Us”

Still, community members have been vigilant. Mario Nodal, creator of Unidos Podemos, a bilingual Instagram page, has spent the last months documenting ICE kidnappings and raids across the country by sharing crowd-sourced videos.

He said the ICE raids and Supreme Court ruling are very concerning. While Unidos Podemos originally started as a page to uplift Mexican American culture, it quickly turned into a platform to raise awareness about ICE activity after the Trump administration took office.

“People are just doing their job,” Nodal said. “They’re just out there doing what they need to do to survive, and ICE just pulls up on them, simply because of how they look and how they sound, and just takes them away. They don’t identify themselves. They don’t show their faces.”

Nodal said it is important to document the raids and their intensity. People have messaged him about families being separated, neighbors being profiled, and people being afraid to go to work or even leave their homes.

“It’s impossible to ignore what is happening,” Nodal said. “There are thousands of videos just showing abuse, discrimination, and just racial profiling.”

Nodal shares fundraiser campaigns of people who are impacted by ICE raids. He also said it is important to continue celebrating Latino culture and honoring the sacrifices that have been made to make a life in the U.S.

“In the midst of all of this, we’re still trying to push that culture, like Día de los Muertos, still trying to push it in front of people that don’t like us, people that hate us, like ‘We don’t care, you’re gonna see our culture, you’re gonna see who we are,’” Nodal said. “We’re still here. This is who we are, you’re not just gonna get rid of us.”

Cardona said her organization has also been proactive in fighting back against ICE activity. She said Unión del Barrio has been doing “know your rights” workshops and training people on how to spot ICE and report to the community when they do see them. Like Nodal, Cardona also said it is important to document ICE raids and kidnappings to help people understand what they have been seeing and the way ICE goes about these operations.

Advocates have also been organizing patrols and responding to reported ICE activity. Cardona said there have been many instances where community members in Los Angeles have been able to chase ICE agents away and prevent people from being detained.

“We know that less happens to people when there’s large numbers of community members, when the agents are outnumbered in large quantities,” Cardona said.

Unión del Barrio also encourages people not to walk on the street by themselves, to stay in large crowds, and to use their right to stay silent, so that it’s impossible to distinguish if there’s anyone in the group who’s undocumented.

“In this moment, there is a beautiful hope that exists in this solidarity and that people are standing up for what is right,” Cardona said. “There are people out there that care and that are organizing to defend rights, and that’s what they are — their rights. These are human rights and civil rights that are being infringed upon. I’m very proud of how community members, community organizers, and of course, my organizations have stood up in defense of our people.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2230414417-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 16:56:42.526724

Nada Radovan Tomanic, 53, of West Virginia, formerly of Hartford, served with the Zulfikar Special Unit of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s, during the armed conflict in the region, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Connecticut. Officials allege that Tomanic participated in the physical and psychological abuse of Bosnian Serb civilian prisoners.

“The defendant obtained the privileges of U.S. citizenship through lies and deceit, concealing the violent crimes she committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Department is fully committed to holding accountable those who exploit our immigration system and pose a threat to public safety.”

“Covering up past human rights abuses to attain U.S. citizenship is an egregious offense, and I thank our law enforcement partners both here in the U.S. and in Bosnia and Herzegovina for investigating this matter to ensure that justice is done,” said U.S. Attorney David Sullivan for the District of Connecticut.

When applying for U.S. naturalization in 2012, officials say Tomanic falsely denied having served in a detention facility or in any other situation involving the detention of others, officials said.

“Individuals who lie on their naturalization documents undermine the process for all who justly apply to be a part of our great nation,” said FBI special agent in charge P.J. O’Brien of the FBI.

“Tomanic’s admissions of fraud are detestable because of her history of targeting people based on their ethnicity and religion.

Tomanic pleaded guilty to procuring citizenship contrary to law.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in October in favor of the Trump administration's move to revoke the protection, ruling that left roughly 350,000 Venezuelans immediately at risk of deportation, while protections for an additional 250,000 expired November 7.
In a statement, the coalition said that Venezuelans ""did not emigrate by choice"" but because ""it was the only way to safeguard the lives, well-being, and futures of their families.""

The group said Venezuelans abroad should not be criminalized, adding: ""Being Venezuelan is not a crime.","Venezuela's main opposition coalition, Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD), warned Sunday that the recent termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States leaves an estimated 600,000 Venezuelans vulnerable to detention and deportation and urged the Trump administration to offer a different protection channel for them.

TPS protected Venezuelans who fled the country's prolonged crisis and had been residing in the U.S. since 2021. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in October in favor of the Trump administration's move to revoke the protection, ruling that left roughly 350,000 Venezuelans immediately at risk of deportation, while protections for an additional 250,000 expired November 7.

In a statement, the coalition said that Venezuelans ""did not emigrate by choice"" but because ""it was the only way to safeguard the lives, well-being, and futures of their families."" It described TPS not as a privilege, but as a measure that allowed families to ""live with stability, work legally, and rebuild their lives while Venezuela fights to recover its democracy.""

The group urged U.S. authorities to review the decision and develop a mechanism guaranteeing lawful presence, particularly for those who ""have demonstrated themselves to be exemplary residents in the communities where they live."" Ending the program without an alternative ""generates unjust and unnecessary uncertainty,"" it said.

Opposition figures Edmundo González Urrutia and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado had previously shared a similar position on Friday, saying they had appealed directly to both the Trump administration and Congress. ""We work day and night to achieve from U.S. authorities a review of the case and the issuance of a status that protects them,"" they said in a joint statement.

""Being Venezuelan must never again be synonymous with being a refugee,"" their statement continued. They argued that the long-term solution is political change inside Venezuela, asserting that ""the greatest protection is to recover freedom, restore the value of the passport, and have a democratic government that defends its people.""

Most of the others were deported, and their criminal histories were not presented in Friday's disclosure.
The consent decree at issue, known as the Castañon-Nava settlement agreement, restricts the ability of ICE agents or others working with them to make warrantless arrests in Illinois.
“It seems highly likely to me that at least some of those individuals are among the 615 detainees who are not subject to mandatory detention,” Cummings said.
On Friday, 21 people were arrested outside the immigration detention center in Broadview following a morning demonstration outside the facility.","President Donald Trump and his administration have claimed repeatedly that the immigration raids that have terrorized communities nationwide this year are focused on getting the ""worst of the worst"" off the streets and out of the country, but new detention data filed by the Department of Justice on Friday shows that only a tiny fraction of the more than 600 people who remain in detention in the Chicago area from raids over recent months have any criminal record, bolstering anecdotal evidence that many of those targeted for by ICE and federal border agents are hard-working, law-abiding members of society.

According to the Chicago Tribune:

The Trump administration on Friday released the names of 614 people whose Chicago-area immigration arrests may have violated a 2022 consent decree, and only 16 of them have criminal histories that present a “high public safety risk.”

The list was produced as part of an ongoing lawsuit alleging immigration agents have repeatedly violated the terms of the in-court settlement, mostly during “Operation Midway Blitz,” that puts a high bar on making so-called warrantless arrests without a prior warrant or probable cause.

The newspaper reports that of the 16 people arrested with criminal histories—representing just 2.6% of the total listed in the filing— ""five involved domestic battery, two were related to drunken driving, and one allegedly had an unidentified criminal history in another country."" None had criminal backgrounds that included worst-of-the-worst offenses like rape or murder.

Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the government to provide more information about the more than 600 people being held in detention and suggested he would order their release if compelling public-safety reasons were not presented. While ordering the immediate release of 13 people he deemed were arrested unlawfully, Cummings gave the government until Friday to release the additional information on those being held.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports that the list of 614 detainees comes from a longer list of roughly 1,800 individuals arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, of which ""only about 750 of them remain in the country."" Most of the others were deported, and their criminal histories were not presented in Friday's disclosure.

The consent decree at issue, known as the Castañon-Nava settlement agreement, restricts the ability of ICE agents or others working with them to make warrantless arrests in Illinois.

“Communities throughout the Chicago area have been traumatized by ICE and other federal agents’ chaotic and violent actions in our neighborhoods in recent months, and potentially hundreds of families already have been permanently separated as a result of unlawful arrests and rapid deportations without due process,"" said Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation for the National Immigration Justice Center (NIJC), who is backing the legal case against the unlawful arrests and detentions in Chicago, after the order issued by Cummings on Wednesday.

""NIJC and our partners will continue to demand justice for our communities and accountability for the lawless administration we all are facing.”

During Wednesday's hearing, the judge suggested many of those who remain in detention likely have no history of criminal conduct and were targeted by federal agents simply for fitting a specific profile. As the Sun-Times reports:

Cummings said that 54 of those people were arrested at work, including 20 landscapers and four ride-share or taxi drivers. Twenty were arrested commuting to or from work, he added, and nine were arrested at a Home Depot or Menards, “presumably either seeking work or to pick up supplies.”

Seven were also arrested at an “immigration-related hearing,” Cummings said, while 11 were arrested in public places like a park, gas station or even a Dunkin’ Donuts drive-thru.

“It seems highly likely to me that at least some of those individuals are among the 615 detainees who are not subject to mandatory detention,” Cummings said. He also found them unlikely to be members of gangs, “assorted other ne’er-do-wells” or the “worst of the worst.”

Community members living in Chicago and its outlying suburbs, including Broadview, have expressed anger at Trump's ICE operations in the region, which have seen school teachers, childcare providers, day laborers, and other neighbors targeted and arrested.

""Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,"" Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.""

Local officials, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, criticized such actions, saying in a statement they ""are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.""

""We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,"" said the statement, also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government hadn't previously announced the push. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte has seen a spate of high-profile crimes this year, including the shocking murder of Ukranian refugee Iryna Zarutska, 23, who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte light rail train in August by a repeat offender with an extensive history of violence.

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino - a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte - said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulling people over since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said. ""I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.""

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

""I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,"" he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped - twice - by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said he was finally allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship. Aceituno said he had to walk back some distance to his car. He later filed a police report over the broken glass.

An encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton's front yard on Saturday morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One agent tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They didn't respond, and the agents left in a gray minivan without making arrests.

""This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we've got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They've broken no laws, and that's what concerns me,"" Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone, told The Associated Press.

""It's an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,"" the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports that Charlotte could be the next city facing an immigration crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed, but the contractor decided to go ahead.

""Half an hour later he's in our yard, he's working and Border Patrol rolls up,"" she said. ""They're here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there's just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.""

Some businesses close

Local organizations sought to prepare for the push, trying to inform immigrants of their rights and considering peaceful protests. JD Mazuera Arias, who won election to the Charlotte City Council in September, was one of about a dozen people standing watch Saturday outside a Latin American bakery in his district in east Charlotte.

A nearby bakery was closed amid word of the possible immigration crackdown, he said. The government action was hurting both people's livelihoods and the city's economy, he said.

""This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?"" he asked. ""This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants, but for U.S. citizens.""

President Donald Trump's administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the vast majority of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.

He urged people to record any ""inappropriate behavior"" they see and notify local law enforcement about it.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasized ahead of time that it isn't involved in federal immigration enforcement.

According to friends and family, Jeremy Dottin-Reina, a French citizen living in the U.S. with an expired visa, was followed by unmarked SUVs from the home he shares with his husband, Rick Reina, in Liverpool to their shop, Syracuse Soapworks, on Hawley Avenue.

They say multiple vehicles trailed them through the drive into the city. When they pulled in behind the building, Jeremy got out of the car and headed for the back door of the shop.

He made it inside and locked the door just seconds before agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reached the entrance.

“Rick had called me early in the morning that they were being tailed by ICE and Jeremy just had made it into the house and they were right on his tail and he was feet away from being taken,” said Michael DeSalvo, owner of Hairanoia

DeSalvo is more than just a friend. He owns Hairanoia, the hair salon directly across the street from Syracuse Soapworks, and has a long history of community activism — from supporting immigrants to providing end-of-life care for people with AIDS.

He says as soon as he got the call, he threw on clothes and started reaching out to every activist and rapid-response group he knew.

DeSalvo’s first move was to warn the neighborhood. Right as the attempted raid was unfolding, he posted an urgent message on Facebook:

“PEOPLE PLEASE GET HERE TO HAIRANOIA IMMEDIATELY. ICE IS TRYING TO TAKE SOMEONE ACROSS FROM HAIRANOIA.”

Within minutes, he says, dozens of community members showed up outside the shop to stand watch and support the couple.

“The conditions and the way that people are being treated is absolutely disgusting and inhumane and I hope that someday there will be accountability for the treatment,” DeSalvo said.

DeSalvo says a small group of friends, advocates and legal contacts spent the entire day quietly strategizing — careful not to reveal details that could tip off ICE. They won’t share their full plan publicly, but say they were able to help Jeremy leave the city and, eventually, leave the United States without being taken into immigration custody.

Jeremy is now back in his home country of France.

While Jeremy is home overseas, Rick and their community are still processing what happened, and what it means for their future in Syracuse.

“When we last saw each other, the emotions and the seriousness of the day we have not had a chance to even really process it,” DeSalvo said, describing seeing Rick again days later.

“Rick has not had a chance to process any of it. He’s left holding the bag of their life together alone. Emotionally, think about how sad that is.”

DeSalvo says it feels, in some ways, like a death, even though Jeremy is alive and safe.

The couple has spent more than two decades building a life and a business in Syracuse. Syracuse Soapworks has become a familiar name in the city, and DeSalvo says the loss of Jeremy isn’t just personal — it’s a blow to the neighborhood.

For now, Syracuse Soapworks remains open, but Rick told supporters the shop will eventually have to close without Jeremy there to help run it. Friends say they expect to organize fundraising efforts, including a GoFundMe, to help Rick transition and eventually reunite with his husband in France.

DeSalvo says one lesson stands out from the chaos of that day: neighbors looking out for neighbors.

He hopes what happened on Hawley Avenue will push more people to get to know the families and business owners around them, especially those who may feel vulnerable.

“Know your neighbors,” he said. “And look out for them.”",https://cnycentral.com/resources/media/e894e73f-79f2-4216-a0eb-b8f895ea9e70-Screenshot20251114183741.png,N,,2025-11-15 16:56:52.551473

“I have a friend group – most of them are on skilled worker visas,” she said.","As Reform UK soars in the polls, Britain’s migrant communities are facing an uncertain future.

The party has announced a swathe of hardline immigration policies, including its plans to abolish indefinite leave to remain – the right to settle permanently in the UK after five years of residence.

Nigel Farage has said non-UK citizens would have to continue to apply for visas, with new higher salary thresholds. Although Reform has not specified what those thresholds would be, it is reported they could be set at about £60,000 a year – far in excess of the £41,700 currently required for most skilled worker visas.

Skilled worker visas come with restrictions and can be cancelled if a person leaves their employer, or if their salary changes.

In addition, the Labour government’s plans to extend the indefinite leave to remain qualifying period to 10 years have been perceived as an attempt to claw back the support of voters who are considering backing Reform.

Here, some people who have chosen to make the UK their home tell the Guardian how the lives they have built are now in jeopardy.

Jinnie Shin, 44, an emergency medicine doctor living in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire

Shin, originally from the US, came to the UK as a medical student in 2015. She had barely left medical school when the NHS was paralysed by Covid. As a newly qualified doctor at Croydon university hospital, south London, she found herself battling to save the lives of those floored by the virus – and comforting the dying as they said goodbye to their loved ones on video calls.

Five years on, Shin, from Boston, is now an emergency medicine registrar at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. Despite the sacrifices she has made for the NHS – she didn’t see her family for 18 months while working 12-hour shifts treating patients on ventilators – she wonders if she has a future in Britain.

Shin, 44, is now eligible for indefinite leave to remain. However, she has been left questioning whether it is worth paying the “enormous” costs – application fees start at about £3,000 – only for Reform to rescind settled status if they win the next general election.

She also worries that setting the salary thresholds for skilled worked visas at about £60,000 a year would devastate the NHS. A registrar beginning specialist training earns £52,656. The starting salary for a resident doctor – formerly known as a junior doctor – is £38,831.

“You are basically talking about culling [doctors] who will eventually become our registrars and consultants,” Shin said. “This sort of move would eliminate the foot soldiers of the NHS.”

Shin maintains that she was “fortunate” to be able to help the health service navigate the worst crisis in its history in her first year as a doctor, but feels the toll it took on her and other immigrants – about a fifth of the NHS workforce is from outside the UK – may be forgotten.

“It was terrifying,” she said. “I saw more death in the first two weeks than I have in my entire career thus far. As traumatised as many healthcare workers are, we do appreciate that we did a great service for people.

“Every day was the worst day of someone else’s life and that was our day, day in, day out. It was truly devastating. I was on my own without any family support.

“Some of us actually sacrificed our lives. Some of us have come out of it like we’ve been to war – because we really were at war with this virus. People are talking about us as if we’re a drain on resources.

“I have good friends who I see regularly. I have a partner, who is European, but has been settled in the UK for 20 years. We have a fantastic life here, in terms of what we have built for ourselves, but when we talk about our future here, we’re just not sure.”

Shin said she has also observed an uptick in “microaggressions” directed at some doctors of colour. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, recently said he was shocked at the “ugly” racism experienced by some NHS workers.

She added: “As someone who, every day, goes in and takes care of the people of the UK – some of these people, what if inside they’re thinking: I’d rather have a white, English, male doctor? It’s an uncomfortable situation to be in.

“I hate to think staying in the UK would be a bad decision, but it’s looking less and less like a good one. I would love to stay, because I’ve built my life here, but I don’t really feel that welcome any more.”

Shyamsundar was elated when he was offered his “dream job” as a human factors engineer, working to help enhance Britain’s defence capabilities amid increasing global instability. In 2021, he came to the UK from Pune, western India, on a skilled worker visa.

He and his wife, a graphic designer, adore the life they have built in Bury, Greater Manchester, and want to buy their own home there. But with the future of Britain’s immigration system shrouded in uncertainty, they have put their plans on hold.

“2025 has been the hardest year I’ve had to face,” he said. “The reminders that your life may be temporary are a constant drain on your mental health. The big news announcements from all the parties take their toll. It’s always there in your mind that your way of life can be taken away from you. I haven’t slept very well in the last six months. It’s been difficult. It’s been an exercise in resilience. We’re socially, financially and even emotionally invested in the UK. We’ve almost had the rug pulled from under us.”

Shyamsundar should be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain next April, but is plagued by questions about whether this will guarantee a long-term future in the UK. He also lives with the threat of having his visa revoked should the rules change. He said he would not qualify for a skilled worker visa if Reform raised the salary threshold to about £60,000 a year.

“It doesn’t take away from what my job is – the people I want to keep safe, the pilots, ground crew, everybody,” he said. “But there is a lot of rhetoric around immigration. It can be demoralising when you focus on it, but as collective, we as defence workers, immigrants in defence and aerospace, make a difference.

“One of the biggest messages I try to deliver is that migrants are a net contributors. We have had a lot of chat that immigration is a drain on the economy. When you look at the hard data, there is a very different story.”

Shyamsundar said questions over his future in the UK often hit him at unexpected moments.

“It’s like a death by a thousand cuts – walking along in the autumn, seeing the leaves fall, and thinking, I might not be here next autumn,” he said. “That’s what really breaks your heart. It takes a toll on people.”

Douna Haj Ahmed, 34, a Syrian refugeeworking for a multiple sclerosis charity and living in Wembley, London

Haj Ahmed arrived in the UK on a scholarship in 2017, after living through years of war in Syria. Eight years later, Haj Ahmed – who works for a leading multiple sclerosis charity and says she has never claimed benefits – can’t imagine living anywhere but London.

“My integration is rooted in real human connection,” she said. “London now feels like home in every sense of the word. Each time I travel outside of the city, I feel the pull to return. When I return to London I’m pleased – I’m home.”

Haj Ahmed devotes her spare time to charity work. She has worked as a volunteer interpreter for refugees, given free tuition to A-level and GCSE students and provided companionship for dementia patients.

She and her husband, Abdullah al-Nofal, 37, have bought a house in Wembley, north-west London, and are in the process of applying for indefinite leave to remain, although they say their application has been complicated by recent regime change in Syria. Nofal says he was detained in Syria’s notorious al-Khatib prison – known as “hell on earth” because thousands were tortured there.

“Throughout these years, my husband and I have contributed to the economy and society without ever relying on the state,” Haj Ahmed, 34, said. “We have integrated fully into British society and British life. The relationships I have formed have become the foundation of my sense of belonging. I have embraced UK traditions, history and social norms.”

Haj Ahmed, who added that she has severe depression because of uncertainty over her immigration status, said Reform’s plans to scrap indefinite leave to remain would “destroy” her life.

“This policy undermines a sense of stability for us, which is essential to integration.” she said. “When people work, study and contribute for years, they deserve a clear and reliable pathway to permanence, not shifting rules which make belonging feel really conditional.

“I wanted to have children this year. We worked very hard to have a home here, so now we have a mortgage. We are reaching for stability but we don’t know where we’re going. The broader question is, what kind of country does the UK want to be? My story shows what refugees and immigrants can contribute when given the opportunity.”

Haj Ahmed said being deported to Syria would be unthinkable. Although the Assad regime fell late last year, concerns about violence and human rights violations persist. The country has also been targeted by Israeli drone strikes.

“I don’t have any other place to go,” she said. “I’m being treated as a number, a figure. It’s not my fault, what happened in my country. I ran away from death and the Assad regime.

“Many Syrians who visited Syria recently say they feel like strangers in a place they were born because the country has changed and so have we. Belonging is not just about geography, it’s about where your life is, where your friends are, where you feel safe, where you have a home.”

Sayali Wandhekar, 30, a designer living in Camden, London

Sayali Wandhekar moved to London to study for a master’s degree in 2020. She loved it so much that, in 2022, she took a job as a designer in the corporate sector. However, the “shifting goalposts” on immigration rules mean she is now struggling to plan for the future.

Wandhekar, 30, hopes to apply for indefinite leave to remain when her skilled worker visa expires in 2027, unless the eligibility criteria changes before then.

“I don’t know what the system is going to look like,” she said. “How many years am I going to have to be on a skilled worker visa? I’ve come so close to getting ILR (indefinite leave to remain). In terms of mental health, it does create a lot of uncertainty.

“I want to be here long term. I’ve made a life here. I have a strong friend group. I have a proper life. But am I going to buy a house, settle here, have children here? It’s something I can’t plan for.”

Wandhekar says a “significant” number of her colleagues are “distressed” by the idea the salary threshold for a skilled worker visa could increase to about £60,000 a year. She added that a Reform victory in the next general election could force her to rethink her future in the country – and perhaps prompt her to return to her native Pune, in western India.

“[It] would definitely turn me towards considering other places I can move to, plus potentially moving back to India,” she said. “The last thing I want is to be on a skilled worker visa forever. It restricts my freedom.”

Wandhekar added that she feared the UK could suffer a brain drain if skilled workers were unable to settle in the country permanently.

“I have a friend group – most of them are on skilled worker visas,” she said. “If they were to scrap indefinite leave to remain, most, if not all of them will look for options outside of the country.

“I have friends who are engineers, in finance and consulting – highly skilled jobs. If they were to move back to other countries, then we are going to see fewer people in those workplaces. From a diversity perspective, you are going to miss out on international talent. How do you upscale people in the UK to take on those jobs?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0987e72b5dd4c045230b37f367146cb5417b1e/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf64a430075ff9866f17163d97b9fd99",N,,2025-11-15 13:56:51.169773

The move seems to be in part due to a “political grudge match” between Jeffries and Lawler, Politico noted.
However, the collective bargaining rights of over 1 million federal workers — whose lives were just thrown into limbo amid the longest-ever government shutdown — are at stake.
Trump’s sweeping executive orders have stripped the right of collective bargaining for workers across over a dozen federal agencies.","On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) blocked an effort broadly supported by his own caucus to force a vote on restoring crucial labor protections for federal workers that were revoked by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

A Democrat-led petition on the “Protect America’s Workforce Act” is just two signatures short of the 218-member threshold it needs to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on the legislation. The bill would reverse a Trump executive order that removed collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of federal employees — a major blow to labor rights in the heavily unionized sector.

Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), coming off of her confirmation long delayed by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), tried to sign the petition on Wednesday. The petition for the legislation has been signed by the entire Democratic caucus other than Grijalva, as well as three Republicans. If Grijalva signed it, then Rep. Mike Lawler (R-New York) was poised to be the 218th signature, Politico reports.

But members of Jeffries’s staff stopped Grijalva as she went to add her signature on the House floor on Wednesday, Politico reported. A Jeffries spokesperson, Christie Stephenson, criticized Lawler when contacted about the move.

“If Congressman Lawler was as concerned about these working people as he apparently is about his own reelection, he would have signed the discharge petition last night, or any time in the over 160 days since it launched,” Stephenson told the outlet. She said that Democrats would force a vote on it soon.

“We also look forward to him signing on as a co-sponsor of the historically bipartisan Protecting the Right to Organize Act given his sincere concern for collective bargaining rights in this country,” Stephenson said.

The move seems to be in part due to a “political grudge match” between Jeffries and Lawler, Politico noted. Last month, the two got into a shouting match in relation to the government shutdown, with Lawler at one point questioning why Jeffries hadn’t yet endorsed Democratic nominee for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani.

Democrats have also raised concerns that Lawler has said that he’s waiting to be the 218th lawmaker to sign on so he could tout it in his reelection campaign.

However, the collective bargaining rights of over 1 million federal workers — whose lives were just thrown into limbo amid the longest-ever government shutdown — are at stake.

""Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to.
""And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop — this time for the rest of this lawsuit.""
She also ordered the government to ""provide private rooms for closed-door discussions between detainees and current and prospective attorneys, legal representatives, and legal assistants.""
At a hearing last month, government attorney Jonathan Ross argued that “evidence shows detainees at B-18 are meeting with attorneys, they have access to counsel.""","A federal judge on Friday ruled that the government is ""partially blocking access to lawyers"" for immigrant detainees held in a downtown Los Angeles processing center and ordered it to stop.

The preliminary injunction essentially extends a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued in July, requiring federal immigration agencies to allow legal visitation at the B-18 detention facility in downtown L.A. seven days a week.

In her ruling this week, Frimpong said that lawyer visiting hours at B-18, which is in the basement of a federal building, have been closed down repeatedly without letting lawyers know, despite her ordering the government to notify them.

""Officers insist on keeping the door open when lawyers are trying to have private conversations with their clients — even though this means the conversations are no longer private,"" Frimpong said. ""Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to. Individuals in B-18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have. And sometimes, individuals are moved from B-18 to another location which does not allow lawyer visits at all.""

""And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop — this time for the rest of this lawsuit.""

Mark Rosenbaum, of Public Counsel, which helped bring the lawsuit, said that the court has ""affirmed that the Constitution does not stop at the doors of a detention center.""

""This is a terribly important ruling, not just because it enjoins the denial of access to lawyers, but because it takes apart a key part of ICE's strategy in Los Angeles and that has been to dehumanize Latinos and to do everything they can to assure that Latinos that are subject to these raids are not able to avail themselves of their basic rights, not be able to disclose to lawyers the racial profiling that is going forward and not be able to establish their dignity and their basic rights to due process,"" Rosenbaum said.

Frimpong ordered that legal visitation be permitted seven days per week, for a minimum of eight hours per day on business days and a minimum of four hours per day on weekends and holidays. She also ordered the government to ""provide private rooms for closed-door discussions between detainees and current and prospective attorneys, legal representatives, and legal assistants.""

Detainees will be provided with access to confidential telephone calls with legal team members and those calls ""shall not be screened, recorded, or otherwise monitored,"" Frimpong wrote.

""No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""All detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members. Every single detainee receives due process.""

At a hearing last month, government attorney Jonathan Ross argued that “evidence shows detainees at B-18 are meeting with attorneys, they have access to counsel."" He also said that exigent circumstances — protests that sprang up against immigration raids — shifted conditions at the facility, thus impacting clients’ access to attorneys.

“That circumstance has now changed and conditions at B-18 have now normalized,” he said, adding that “the government is going to do the right thing” regardless of any order.

“The court should not be ordering the government to do what it already is,” Ross said, adding that detainees “are receiving what the 5th Amendment requires.""

The government had requested a stay of the injunction pending appeal, which Frimpong denied.

The American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

Along with access issues, plaintiffs also argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn’t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful warrantless arrests.

Frimpong previously issued a ruling in the same case temporarily blocking federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. The Supreme Court granted an emergency appeal and lifted that order.

Last month, Frimpong approved expedited discovery on the claim that the aggressive raids violate a person’s 4th Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. The government will have to produce documents and witnesses for deposition relating to around 15 raids, in addition to general operational information.

""I think there is some sense out there that with the Supreme Court's granting of the stay that this put this case to bed,"" Rosenbaum said. ""This case is alive and kicking and the racial profiling and other illegal attacks on the Latino community and the community at large, we're going to put them to an end.""

Jose Barco-Chirino, 39, came to the U.S. when he was four years old, later joining the military where he served two tours in Iraq and was injured in combat, and applied for citizenship while deployed in 2006. His representatives say that, unfortunately, Barco-Chirino’s paperwork was lost.

Advocate Anna Stout told FOX31 that his family had fled Cuba and gone to Venezuela after his father was exiled, then came to the U.S. as political refugees. Stout said that Barco has no ties in Venezuela or Cuba, and asserted this puts him at an elevated risk if he were to be removed to either country.

On Friday, Stout said that Barco-Chirino’s family received a call from a detainee at the Aurora GEO facility, which is contracted by ICE, saying that Barco-Chirino had been removed from the detention facility. On Wednesday, Nov. 12, the family was told Barco-Chirino was at a staging area in Arizona, and on Friday, at about 8:15 a.m. ET, the family reportedly received a text saying their family member had been removed from the U.S.

ICE said that Barco-Chirino was deported to Nogales, Mexico, after receiving a final order of removal on Feb. 12, 2025.

“Jose Barco-Chirino was arrested by ERO Denver officers Jan. 21, 2025, at the Colorado State Penitentiary in Canon City, Colorado,” an ICE spokesperson told FOX31 on Friday. “Barco was released after serving time for a conviction of attempted murder, extreme indifference, and felony menacing with a real or simulated weapon. He was served with a notice to appear and will remain in ICE custody pending the resolution of his immigration proceedings.”

Stout and Barco-Chirino’s attorney told FOX31 in August that Barco-Chirino served 15 years in prison for attempted murder after he left the military, where he had been stationed out of Colorado Springs. He was arrested by ICE immediately after he was paroled.

Attorneys had argued for Barco-Chirino to be sent to Mexico, over Venezuela or Cuba, where he could still receive treatment for his PTSD and past suicidal ideations. The family said they feared he would be tortured if he was sent to Venezuela or Cuba due to his military service.

California requires driver's licenses and work permits to have the same expiration dates, officials said. Notices were sent out on Nov. 6 to affected drivers warning their licenses would expire in 60 days.

The move comes amid an ongoing clash between the Trump administration and Gov. Gavin Newsom over California's non-domiciled commercial driver's licensing program. It also follows a nationwide audit of such programs after officials said a truck driver living in the U.S. illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a written statement.

State officials, however, said the drivers were not ""illegal immigrants"" and that they were authorized to work in the country by the federal government.

“Once again, Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” said Brandon Richards, a Newsom spokesman.

California is one of 19 states, in addition to Washington, D.C., that issues driving licenses to immigrants without legal status. Doing so allows people to work and travel safely, immigrant rights advocates argue.

But California — along with six other states, including Texas — came under scrutiny after an audit conducted by the Department of Transportation's Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency responsible for preventing commercial motor vehicle-related deaths and injuries.

Read more: Transportation Dept. tightens noncitizen truck driver rules after fatal crash in Florida

That audit found irregularities in the issuance of non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses.

Duffy said the audit found 25% of the licenses issued in California violated federal rules, including by extending well beyond an individual's work permit end date.

In October, following the audit, Duffy withheld more than $40 million in transportation grants and claimed California was not only continuing to issue commercial driver's licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally, but was also not enforcing new English language requirements for truckers.

Officials have refuted Duffy's claims and said the state has complied with federal laws and regulations. California's Department of Motor Vehicles said on its website that it was not issuing or renewing non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses as of Sept. 29.

Proposed new federal rules that would include mandatory federal immigration status checks, limiting the duration of the license and limiting eligibility to certain immigration visas, were temporarily put on hold by a federal appeals court this week.

The ruling provided relief for thousands of immigrants who were at risk of losing their licenses.

Those arrested—including Woolf, Rev.
Luke Harris-Ferree, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church of Evanston; and Eric Haar, a member of Grace, were taken to nearby jails.","At least three Evanston residents were among 21 people arrested Friday at the Immigration & Customs (ICE) Enforcement facility in west suburban Broadview. They were part of a clergy-led protest against ICE. Many of the leaders had worked for weeks to prepare for their civil disobedience action. Some felt that previous Broadview clergy-run events that were based solely on prayer and ritual were not bold enough to make people take notice of the conditions there. They wanted to take to the street — and were surprised by the quick violence that they met.

Rev. Michael Woolf, senior pastor of Lake Street Church, was one of dozens of demonstrators who walked onto Beach Street about one block north of the ICE facility. The short street is hemmed by barricades. Demonstrators are supposed to stay off the street in what is called a “free speech zone.”

When Woolf and the others got to the street, they were confronted by Illinois State Police troopers, Cook County Sheriff’s police and Broadview police. The first wave of police responders wore regular uniforms. Police in later waves were in tactical gear: helmets, face shields, and were armed with batons and other weapons.

The Cook County Sheriff’s office released a statement that said: “Four officers sustained injuries trying to redirect them back to the jersey barriers.” About 50 protesters walked onto Beach Street, police said. Those arrested—including Woolf, Rev. Luke Harris-Ferree, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church of Evanston; and Eric Haar, a member of Grace, were taken to nearby jails. They face charges of obstruction, disorderly conduct and walking onto a highway, according to the sheriff’s office.

Prior to the demonstration, two Evanston clergy members—Rev. Eileen Wiviott, senior minister of the Unitarian Church of Evanston, and Rabbi Brant Rosen—took part in a prayer vigil in the freedom-of-speech area.

“Our siblings are locked inside these walls just a few feet away, without basic necessities, without universal human rights, without hope,” said Wiviott. “[U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory] Bovino and his CBP agents may have left this area, but our siblings are not free. They are not liberated. They are not able to leave that building, and the abuses against them continue wherever we build walls and dividing lines, wherever we cage human beings.”

Rosen was more specific. “Our neighbors, locked inside these walls, have been denied toilet paper, a basic need that we all need and take for granted. According to the Torah, we learn that every human being is created with ‘B’tselem Elohim,’ in the divine image. That means each and every one of us is of infinite worth and deserving of human dignity. When those in power denies basic human needs to others, we diminish God’s presence in the world. . . . God stands with the oppressed. God demands freedom.”

Eric Haar said the protest was worthwhile because it gathered attention. “We can’t turn a blind eye on this anymore,” he said after his release Friday afternoon in suburban Maywood. “The more of us that show up the more pressure we are going to put on the government to stop these terroristic abductions of our neighbors.”

Haar returned to the Broadview scene after his release to look for his glasses that went missing. It was the first time he joined a civil disobedience protest.

“This is our duty as Americans to stand up and criticize and fight back against injustice when our government is being unjust to us as citizens,” he said.

Back home Friday evening, Luke Harris-Ferree said: “I’m doing okay. My body is sore. I’m tired, but I’m just processing what happened.”

Harris-Ferree, who also had never before been arrested at a protest, said he was immediately surrounded by police on the street. “I was standing there with my hands up telling the officers we just want to pray with the people inside. We’re here nonviolently,” he said.”There was a cop with his wooden baton pushing it into my ribs, telling me to get back. There was really nowhere to go.”

The scene got violent quickly, he said, because officers did not expect the number of people at the protest or the street action. “I could see it in their eyes. They were scared.”

Harris-Ferree suffered a slight injury when pushed to the ground. “What they did to me was very small in comparison to what they are doing to other people in our country right now,” he said.

The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.

Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.

What did the judge decide?

US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was nominated by former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a 2022 settlement agreement over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.

Last month, Cummings ruled agents violated the previously agreed upon consent decree.

Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.

The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.

The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026, and says if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”

Who will be released and when?

Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.

Out of a list of the more than 600 detainees the Justice Department shared with the court, only 16 had explanations for why they were given an “ICE Further Designation of High Public Safety Risk.” The document indicates they were arrested for a range of charges, including for aggravated assault, DUI, domestic battery, and criminal conspiracy to traffic narcotics.

The document also lists around 40 people as having a “high” risk to public safety designation – though officials do not provide the reasons why. CNN has reached out to Department of Homeland Security and DOJ attorneys for clarity.

Two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.

“What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”

The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.

“They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”

The list of detainees CNN reviewed showed that 75 people have already been “removed” and multiple others are listed as having been “paroled” or “bonded out.”

What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?

Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.

But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.

“If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.

“We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.

In response to the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.

“At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”

The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.

Meanwhile, Bovino left Chicago Thursday morning with his CBP agents and will head next to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.

DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.

Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including from a federal judge, for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.

“All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.

ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin previously told CNN, while other immigration legal challenges move through the courts.

State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.

The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago amid protests against the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.

“Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to.
Individuals in B-18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have.
“All detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members.
Frimpong previously issued a ruling in the same case temporarily blocking federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests.","A federal judge on Friday ruled that the government is “partially blocking access to lawyers” for immigrant detainees held in a downtown Los Angeles processing center and ordered it to stop.

The preliminary injunction essentially extends a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued in July, requiring federal immigration agencies to allow legal visitation at the B-18 detention facility in downtown L.A. seven days a week.

In her ruling this week, Frimpong said that lawyer visiting hours at B-18, which is in the basement of a federal building, have been closed down repeatedly without letting lawyers know, despite her ordering the government to notify them.

“Officers insist on keeping the door open when lawyers are trying to have private conversations with their clients — even though this means the conversations are no longer private,” Frimpong said. “Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to. Individuals in B-18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have. And sometimes, individuals are moved from B-18 to another location which does not allow lawyer visits at all.”

“And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop — this time for the rest of this lawsuit.”

Mark Rosenbaum, of Public Counsel, which helped bring the lawsuit, said that the court has “affirmed that the Constitution does not stop at the doors of a detention center.”

“This is a terribly important ruling, not just because it enjoins the denial of access to lawyers, but because it takes apart a key part of ICE’s strategy in Los Angeles and that has been to dehumanize Latinos and to do everything they can to assure that Latinos that are subject to these raids are not able to avail themselves of their basic rights, not be able to disclose to lawyers the racial profiling that is going forward and not be able to establish their dignity and their basic rights to due process,” Rosenbaum said.

Frimpong ordered that legal visitation be permitted seven days per week, for a minimum of eight hours per day on business days and a minimum of four hours per day on weekends and holidays. She also ordered the government to “provide private rooms for closed-door discussions between detainees and current and prospective attorneys, legal representatives, and legal assistants.”

Detainees will be provided with access to confidential telephone calls with legal team members and those calls “shall not be screened, recorded, or otherwise monitored,” Frimpong wrote.

“No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “All detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members. Every single detainee receives due process.”

At a hearing last month, government attorney Jonathan Ross argued that “evidence shows detainees at B-18 are meeting with attorneys, they have access to counsel.” He also said that exigent circumstances — protests that sprang up against immigration raids — shifted conditions at the facility, thus impacting clients’ access to attorneys.

“That circumstance has now changed and conditions at B-18 have now normalized,” he said, adding that “the government is going to do the right thing” regardless of any order.

“The court should not be ordering the government to do what it already is,” Ross said, adding that detainees “are receiving what the 5th Amendment requires.”

The government had requested a stay of the injunction pending appeal, which Frimpong denied.

The American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

Along with access issues, plaintiffs also argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn’t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful warrantless arrests.

Frimpong previously issued a ruling in the same case temporarily blocking federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. The Supreme Court granted an emergency appeal and lifted that order.

Last month, Frimpong approved expedited discovery on the claim that the aggressive raids violate a person’s 4th Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. The government will have to produce documents and witnesses for deposition relating to around 15 raids, in addition to general operational information.

“I think there is some sense out there that with the Supreme Court’s granting of the stay that this put this case to bed,” Rosenbaum said. “This case is alive and kicking and the racial profiling and other illegal attacks on the Latino community and the community at large, we’re going to put them to an end.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54a1018/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe9%2F38%2F44f591dd42e6be9e0fc74cbf7179%2F1518685-me-worker-arrested-outside-newsom-event-ces-00102.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 12:57:48.689158

In December 2015, Congress enacted CISA 2015 to enable the sharing of cybersecurity information among private, federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal entities. In doing so, Congress took several steps, including:

Exempting entities engaging in such sharing from antitrust liability for disclosing cybersecurity information among private entities; liability for monitoring internal systems for cybersecurity purposes; liability for disclosing personal information related to a cybersecurity threat; and disclosure under federal, state, tribal, or local freedom of information laws, open government laws, open meetings laws, open records laws, or sunshine laws related to shared information;

Preventing entities from waiving privilege and trade secret protection for shared information; and

Limiting federal agencies’ use of shared information to cybersecurity purposes.

The extension of CISA 2015 restores certainty that entities sharing cyber threat information will be protected and that their designations of disclosed information as commercial, financial, and proprietary will be honored. But that extension may be short-lived; the renewal is part of legislation that reopened the U.S. federal government, and that renewal extends CISA 2015 only until January 30 of next year.

AC/DC blasted from the speakers. Red, white and blue flags flapped in the wind. Crowds whooped and cheered as the man of the hour lamented the surge of migrants across the border.

“This country isn’t falling apart,” he bellowed. “It is being shot to pieces, by bullets.”

You’d be forgiven for assuming this was a rally for U.S. President Donald Trump. After all, the U.S. president's name adorned plenty of campaign merch.

But this eruption of visceral rage at immigrants and incumbents took place in Santiago, Chile, at the final campaign event for Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian candidate gaining traction before Sunday's presidential election in Chile, where rising fears of uncontrolled migration have pushed everyone in this race — even the governing coalition's Communist candidate, Jeannette Jara — to the right.

Kaiser is “the only one with a firm hand, the only one who can pull us out of the United Nations, close the borders to all the Venezuelan criminals and throw them in prison in El Salvador,” said Claudia Belmonte, 50, peering out from beneath the brim of a red baseball cap emblazoned with Kaiser’s promise to “Make Chile Great Again.”

Such demands for a “mano dura,"" a “firm hand,” against crime and disorder have reshaped Chilean politics as transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua surged across porous borders from crisis-stricken Venezuela and elsewhere in recent years, importing kidnappings, contract killings and other violent crimes previously unseen in one of Latin America's safest nations.

“People in Chile never had problems with foreigners. But you hear about a gang burying someone alive in your neighborhood and it changes you,” said Carlos Jadué, 49, a lemon vendor in central Santiago. “I'm not racist. I see new people coming in. And I see new crimes.”

The anti-migrant backlash has transformed a nation that just four years ago elected the bright young hope of the Latin American left, President Gabriel Boric, a millennial former protest leader who handily defeated the ultraconservative lawyer José Antonio Kast in 2021 with vows to “bury neoliberalism"" in response to demands of the nation's 2019 social upheaval.

This time around, experts say Chile's nativist fears over illegal immigration give Kast a better shot, even if he's unlikely to clinch the 50% of votes needed to win outright in Sunday’s first round. Polls show Kast facing off against Jara in a runoff on Dec. 14.

In Santiago, there are few vestiges left of the 2019 mass protests against endemic social inequities — known here as “el estallido” or “the explosion"" — in which as many as a million Chileans marched to vent a generation’s worth of economic and political grievances.

One is the stone plinth in the city's Plaza Italia, the central square where protesters battled nightly with police, torching buildings and braving bird shot. The bronze statue of 19th-century Chilean war hero Gen. Manuel Baquedano was defaced, then taken down for what authorities promised would be a quick restoration.

Four years later, the stone plinth, scarred by anti-government graffiti, remains empty and freighted with symbolism. For protesters, it's a reminder of all that's unaddressed. Neoliberalism is alive and well. Chile retains the 1980 constitution adopted by military dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet after Boric twice failed to change it.

For critics, it's a reminder of the lawlessness that struck Chile, a stable prosperous nation that long distinguished itself from its more volatile neighbors. Many Chileans trace their feelings of insecurity back to those days of civil strife, when everything they knew about their country burst.

“I was left-wing until the ‘estadillo,' when I watched chaos taking over our streets,” said Sebastian Jaramillo, a 36-year-old graphic designer at Kaiser’s rally on Wednesday. “I started watching YouTube videos about the decline of our country, I got politicized.”

In the riled-up rallies of Kaiser and Kast, some recognize a familiar revulsion at the centrist consensus that has held sway since the dictatorship.

“The anger from the ‘estallido’ didn’t disappear. It stayed, it festered,” said Juan Medina, 40, who works at a theater in downtown Santiago. “Instead of turning our anger on inequality, the economic system, the political class, we’ve redirected it toward migrants.”

Throughout the campaign, Chile’s presidential contenders have seemed most intent on trying to outdo each other with ruthless anti-immigrant proposals inspired by Trump and El Salvador’s iron-fisted president, Nayib Bukele.

It's not only on the right.

Jara of the Communist Party — the only left-wing front-runner, as Boric can't run for a consecutive term — has also leaned heavily into a law-and-order message, promising to build new prisons and deploy more force to Chile’s borders.

Jara advocates raising the minimum wage, but, in stark contrast to Boric, proposes no changes to Chile's market-led economic model. The former labor minister and union leader dropped plans to nationalize lithium and copper mining. Her platform calls insecurity her “top priority.”

“Observers say this is an election between two extremes — a communist candidate, two far-right candidates,” said Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile. “But actually, there’s quite a lot of consensus on things like immigration.”

Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, even in cases of rape, has kept quiet about his conservative values this time around.

His German-born father’s Nazi party membership has hardly come up. After two failed presidential bids, Kast has found his tough-on-migration platform holds more appeal than his culture war battles. Yet for all his vows to deport tens of thousands of people and build a giant border wall, Kast looks moderate next to Kaiser.

Kast and Kaiser “are going to clean Chile up, so it can be a first-world country,” said Alatina Velázquez, 20, a fashion design student who said she lost two close friends in the last two years to gang violence.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6a9ea54d-38a8-4049-b528-30c13851d432/wirestory_96226f5e4b94779e97e6d079813c46f3_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-15 12:57:52.165258

The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.","NEW YORK -- When he first came to the United States after escaping civil war in Sierra Leone and spending almost a decade in a refugee camp, Dauda Sesay had no idea he could become a citizen. But he was told that if he followed the rules and stayed out of trouble, after some years he could apply. As a U.S. citizen, he would have protection.

It’s what made him decide to apply: the premise — and the promise — that when he became a naturalized American citizen, it would create a bond between him and his new home. He would have rights as well as responsibilities, like voting, that, as he was making a commitment to the country, the country was making one to him.

“When I raised my hand and took the oath of allegiance, I did believe that moment the promise that I belonged,” said Sesay, 44, who first arrived in Louisiana more than 15 years ago and now works as an advocate for refugees and their integration into American society.

But in recent months, as President Donald Trump reshapes immigration and the country's relationship with immigrants, that belief has been shaken for Sesay and other naturalized citizens. There's now fear that the push to drastically increase deportations and shift who can claim America as home, through things like trying to end birthright citizenship, is having a ripple effect.

What they thought was the bedrock protection of naturalization now feels more like quicksand.

Some are worried that if they leave the country, they will have difficulties when trying to return, fearful because of accounts of naturalized citizens being questioned or detained by U.S. border agents. They wonder: Do they need to lock down their phones to protect their privacy? Others are hesitant about moving around within the country, after stories like that of a U.S. citizen accused of being here illegally and detained even after his mother produced his birth certificate.

Sesay said he doesn't travel domestically anymore without his passport, despite having a REAL ID with its federally mandated, stringent identity requirements.

Immigration enforcement roundups, often conducted by masked, unidentifiable federal agents in places including Chicago and New York City, have at times included American citizens in their dragnets. One U.S. citizen who says he was detained by immigration agents twice has filed a federal lawsuit.

Adding to the worries, the Justice Department issued a memo this summer saying it would ramp up efforts to denaturalize immigrants who’ve committed crimes or are deemed to present a national security risk. At one point during the summer, Trump threatened the citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, who naturalized as a young adult.

The atmosphere makes some worried to speak about it publicly, for fear of drawing negative attention to themselves. Requests for comment through several community organizations and other connections found no takers willing to go on the record other than Sesay.

In New Mexico, state Sen. Cindy Nava says she's familiar with the fear, having grown up undocumented before getting DACA — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected people brought to the U.S. as children from being deported — and gaining citizenship through her marriage. But she hadn't expected to see so much fear among naturalized citizens.

“I had never seen those folks be afraid ... now the folks that I know that were not afraid before, now they are uncertain of what their status holds in terms of a safety net for them,"" Nava said.

What citizenship has meant, and who was included, has expanded and contracted over the course of American history, said Stephen Kantrowitz, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said while the word “citizen” is in the original Constitution, it is not defined.

“When the Constitution is written, nobody knows what citizenship means,” he said. “It’s a term of art, it comes out of the French revolutionary tradition. It sort of suggests an equality of the members of a political community, and it has some implications for the right to be a member of that political community. But it is ... so undefined.”

The first naturalization law passed in 1790 by the new country’s Congress said citizenship was for any “free white person” of good character. Those of African descent or nativity were added as a specific category to federal immigration law after the ravages of the Civil War in the 19th century, which was also when the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution to establish birthright citizenship.

In the last years of the 19th century and into the 20th century, laws were put on the books limiting immigration and, by extension, naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1924 effectively barred people from Asia because they were ineligible for naturalization, being neither white nor Black. That didn't change until 1952, when an immigration law removed racial restrictions on who could be naturalized. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.

American history also includes times when those who had citizenship had it taken away, like after the 1923 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. vs. Bhagat Singh Thind. That ruling said that Indians couldn't be naturalized because they did not qualify as white and led to several dozen denaturalizations. At other times, it was ignored, as in World War II, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps.

“Political power will sometimes simply decide that a group of people, or a person or a family isn’t entitled to citizenship,” Kantrowitz said.

In this moment, Sesay says, it feels like betrayal.

“The United States of America — that’s what I took that oath of allegiance, that’s what I make commitment to,” Sesay said. “Now, inside my home country, and I’m seeing a shift. ... Honestly, that is not the America I believe in when I put my hand over my heart.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7b531e55-49fa-4d4b-bd1e-1aa9e7c5faf6/wirestory_116b8bb3dd4444abf4bdcbc266bed48c_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-15 10:59:42.087031

Two of those New Jersey Democrats also announced that they’ll soon be leaving D.C., for very different reasons.

Here’s some of what New Jersey’s members of Congress did in Washington this week.

Reopen your mind

For nearly two months, Democrats insisted that in order for them to vote to reopen the government, Republicans had to work with them to extend ACA subsidies set to expire at the end of this year. For those same two months, Republicans insisted that in order for any negotiations to happen, Democrats needed to reopen the government.

It was a Catch-22 that was at last resolved on Sunday evening, when eight Senate Democrats relented on their filibuster and gave their blessing to a bill that funds the government through January 2026. (The bill also includes three full-year FY2026 appropriations bills.) In exchange, Senate Republican leaders have promised a vote on ACA subsidies, though no similar promise was made in the House.

The bill passed the Senate on Monday and the House on Wednesday – and earned zero votes from New Jersey Democrats in either chamber. Senator Andy Kim called it a “disgrace,” Senator Cory Booker said the Democratic Party needs “new leaders” – perhaps a shot at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the bill but has still borne a lot of intraparty criticism – and even Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-Tenafly), a Problem Solver who spent the House’s hiatus working to find a funding compromise, voted no.

“They didn’t give the American people more affordable health care, so they don’t get my vote,” Gottheimer said. “When they work with us on a bipartisan solution, then I’m in.”

But stuck in the minority, their objections ultimately were moot; the bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Wednesday night, officially bringing the 43-day shutdown – the longest in U.S. history – to an end.

“Now, it’s time to move forward and focus on what matters: lowering costs, strengthening our economy, and securing America’s future,” Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) said. “That is the work the American people sent us here to do, and that is exactly what I will continue to fight for.”

Pinky swear?

Gottheimer and a bipartisan crew of fellow House members are now working on the next step: getting the House to pass some form of ACA subsidy fix. Gottheimer joined 31 other representatives, among them Reps. Kean and Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis), on a letter to Senate leaders today asking for House members to be included when the Senate hashes out the ACA proposal it will vote on next month.

“We kindly request that you include both House Democrats and Republicans in the legislative process leading to the promised health care reform vote in December,” the letter states. “If we work together, our hope is that the bill will not only achieve a sixty-vote majority in the Senate, but will also then move to the House for immediate consideration and passage.”

Kean and Van Drew have both been at the forefront of a charge within their caucus to get an extension passed; Van Drew has said that if Republicans don’t figure something out, there will be electoral hell to pay from voters in 2026. On the night the funding bill passed, he said his task now will be to secure a vote on an extension and get it signed into law.

“I wish that we had done more, as far as locking in something,” he said. “But we didn’t, and we’ve got to open government up. As soon as we open up, we’ve got to press hard to get something done.”

But Democrats – who unanimously support extending the Covid-era subsidies – are skeptical of any GOP promises. “Republicans don’t give a damn. I think that’s what the reality is,” Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark) said. “I wouldn’t take a pinky-swear promise from them.”

12…

12th district Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing) made some unexpected news this week: this term in Congress will be her last.

The 80-year-old congresswoman was first elected in 2014, succeeding Rep. Rush Holt (D-Hopewell) and becoming the first woman of color to represent New Jersey in Congress. Her time in Washington has included holding Congress’s purse-strings on the powerful Appropriations Committee, wailing on Donald Trump and his Republican allies, and championing myriad progressive causes – even those that aren’t immediately popular within her own party.

So why is she heading for the exit? In her retirement announcement, the congresswoman said it’s time to “to pass the torch to the next leader” who will fight for the same fights she’s taken on in Washington. (She was also unable to vote this week due to a herniated disc that kept her in New Jersey, but her office said she’s set to return to D.C. next week.)

“I made this decision with tremendous thought and reflection, and through many personal conversations with my husband Bill and my family,” Watson Coleman said. “I am confident it is the right choice for me and my family who have graciously sacrificed by my side when I placed serving our community above all else and I can truly say, I am at peace with my decision. “

The announcement has created a rapidly developing Democratic primary for her safely blue, incredibly diverse district – two candidates have already launched campaigns and dozens more are considering it – but that’s outside the purview of this dispatch.

11…

11th district Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-Montclair), meanwhile, is about to trade in that title for a new one: governor.

Sherrill doesn’t have to leave Congress until January 20, when her term as governor begins, but she announced on Wednesday that she’ll move that timeline far forward, submitting her letter of resignation next week. (The exact timing of her departure is still in flux.) That will allow a much quicker special election schedule to replace her, with her successor – nearly a dozen Democrats and one Republican have announced campaigns for her seat – likely taking office sometime in April.

In her final speech on the House floor, Sherrill warned her constituents and her soon-to-be-former colleagues not to “give up the ship,” in Navy parlance, and to continue fighting against the policies of the Republican majority.

“To my colleagues: do not let this body become a ceremonial red stamp for an administration that takes food away from children and rips healthcare away from people,” Sherrill said.

Sherrill did stick around long enough, however, to cast a vote against the government funding bill, calling it “malpractice”; her signature will also still count towards the 218 needed for a discharge petition on the Jeffrey Epstein files.

10…

10th district Rep. McIver’s fight against assault charges got handed a major setback this week, after a federal judge rejected her bid to dismiss the charges.

McIver’s attorneys had argued that the charges, which stem from a brief melee at Newark’s Delaney Hall immigrant detention center in May, should be dismissed for two reasons. For one, they said, the indictment is inextricably tied to McIver’s official oversight duties as a member of Congress, which are protected by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause; for another, the Trump administration was selectively and vindictively choosing to prosecute McIver in retaliation for her political views.

But U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper rejected both arguments, writing that there was not sufficient evidence of Trump targeting McIver specifically and that her actions did not count as protected legislative business. “No genuine legislative purpose was advanced by Defendant’s alleged conduct,” Semper wrote.

McIver said in a statement that she was “disappointed” by the ruling, and her lawyer, Paul Fishman, indicated that more legal action may be coming, perhaps including an appeal.

“Although it is apparent that the court gave the motions thoughtful consideration, we believe the decisions are wrong,” Fishman said. “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side. It is also clear that this prosecution is designed to chill the Congresswoman’s lawful authority to conduct oversight and hold the administration to account. We are currently evaluating next steps.”

Andy Kim objects to Illinois politicians acting like New Jersey politicians

In the midst of the government funding drama on the House floor on Wednesday, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Washington) picked an unexpected fight with Rep. Chuy García (D-Illinois), filing a motion of disapproval against her fellow Democrat. Gluesenkamp Perez’s issue: García had initially filed to run for re-election, but ended his campaign at the last minute right as his chief of staff submitted petitions to run for his seat, guaranteeing that she would be the only Democrat to make the ballot.

That sure sounds like something that might happen in New Jersey, though the preferred method in the Garden State is typically to win the primary and then drop out, allowing the local party to choose your replacement. Senator Kim, who has his own history of fighting against backroom political deals, said on social media that García’s scheme was “undemocratic and should not be allowed.”

“Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim wrote. “The House should condemn and steps need to be taken to restore the people’s right to choose.”

Not everyone in New Jersey politics agrees, though; Politico quoted Rep. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City) as being critical of Perez’s tactics, saying that “there are other ways to handle it, and I don’t think this is the best moment if it’s something you feel compelled to do.”

The Masked Agent

In response to reports around the country of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers making arrests without identifying who they are, Rep. Menendez led a letter with 53 of his colleagues to top Department of Homeland Security officials demanding that enforce federal law regarding officer identification.

“We’re deeply troubled by incidents across the country in which ICE and other federal immigration enforcement officers reportedly failed to identify themselves appropriately during arrests,” the letter states. “Even more concerning, these arrests often occur while officers are concealed behind masks without any visible identifier such as a name tag or badge number, compounding confusion and reducing transparency.”

“Such routine violations of legal protections demonstrate the Trump Administration’s disregard for immigrant rights and intentional use of intimidation tactics that undermine public trust and stoke fear in our communities,” it continues.

Also signing onto the letter were New Jersey Reps. Donald Norcross (D-Camden), Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch), and Nellie Pou (D-North Haledon).",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sherrill-Pallone-hug-1024x744.png,N,,2025-11-15 15:57:10.774893

England and Wales are facing a prison capacity crisis. This issue gained public attention recently when the Government implemented a swathe of early releases to ease pressure last summer.[1] But our male prisons have been operating with only a 5% vacancy margin for several years and are no better now. As of October this year, prisons in England and Wales were operating at 98% capacity.[2]

One in every eight inmates housed on the prison estate in England and Wales is a foreign national offender (FNO), which equates to around 10,800 offenders.[3] With the FNO population in English and Welsh prisons taking up 12% of capacity, their removal presents an opportunity to alleviate prison capacity problems significantly. Currently, these offenders can be removed from this country through various means, including the early removal scheme, the facilitated return scheme and prisoner transfer agreements.

But there are complexities that surround these processes that mean progress in deporting FNOs is slower than it could be. The interpretation of articles in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) through domestic human rights law has been a significant barrier to removal: between April 2008 and June 2021 6,042 FNOs had their removal appeal allowed at the First Tier Tribunal with nearly 40% of these doing so on human rights grounds.[4]

Increasing the deportation of FNOs represents a significant opportunity not only to relieve prison capacity problems, but to deliver a significant saving to the taxpayer. Onward analysis reveals that the average annual cost of FNOs in our prison population is much higher than previous estimates: on average £537 million a year since 2019.[5] The process of removing FNOs needs urgent acceleration, and this paper sets out practical measures to achieve this.

Prison capacity in England and Wales

The English and Welsh prison system is at a dangerous tipping point. Prisons housing adult males, the vast majority of the prison population, have been operating at close to 95% capacity for several years. And in June 2024 the prison population rose to almost 88,000, putting adult male prison capacity under severe pressure as it reached 97-99.7%.[6] As of October this year, prisons in England and Wales were again operating at 98% capacity.[7]

How did our prisons get to this point?

There has been significant pressure on the courts with a backlog in cases increasing before 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic intensified this. In particular, the most serious cases being heard in the Crown Court had already increased by 23% from 33,290 cases in March 2019 to 41,045 in March 2020 as the pandemic began.[8]

Figure 1: Number of open cases in the Crown Court 2016-2025[9]

As shown in Figure 1, the impact of pandemic restrictions can be seen with the backlog of cases increasing a further 46% to 59,928 in September 2021. And this has only worsened since. When restrictions were lifted, there was a sharp increase in the prison population as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Prison population and capacity in England and Wales 2015-2025[10]

The most recent figures show that by the end of March 2025, the Crown Court backlog reached 76,957 – an 11% increase on March 2024. The Magistrates’ court backlog also increased by 13% relative to the previous year, reaching 310,304 in March 2025. This means that there is now a larger population being held in custody on remand awaiting trial.[11]

Tougher and therefore longer sentences have also been rising since 2023. In 2012, the average prison sentence was a year and six weeks, which increased to a year and nine months by 2023.[12] And prison capacity has not increased over the same period. In 2024, excluding offenders recalled to jail after early release, prisoners with sentences of four or more years made up 72% of the prison population. This is compared to just 54% in 2009.[13]

Figure 3: Types of crimes 2020-2024[14]

There has been a sharp increase in offenders serving sentences for violent crimes which attract longer sentences since 2022, as shown in Figure 3 – the number of violent offences has increased by nearly a third since 2019. This has resulted in one in three prisoners being guilty of a violent offence. What’s more, the number of sexual offenders has increased by over 3,000 since March 2021.[15] Taken together, violent and sexual offenders make up more than half of all prisoners. Looking at the share of cautions and convictions among FNOs, the most represented crimes are drug offences, sexual offences, criminal damage and arson, and then fraud.[16]

In the last decade there has been a significant increase in the number of people recalled to prison after breaking the terms of their parole. Ministry of Justice data shows that between January and March 2025, there were 13,296 prisoner releases and 10,101 recalls – this means that for every four people released in the first quarter of 2025, a staggering three were recalled.[17]

Prison building and early release

The previous Government committed to delivering 20,000 new prison places by the mid-2020s. As of September 2024, only 6,518 new prison places have been added.[18]

The National Audit Office (NAO) identified several reasons for this delay: an over-ambitious timeline, weakness of governance and risk management, a lack of prioritisation from the Treasury, and a challenging economic and delivery environment. In particular, the NAO highlighted that given the time it takes to obtain planning permission to build new prisons, 20,000 new prison places in around five years was highly unrealistic. Rising costs and inflation also had a significant impact. Between January 2020 and February 2024, there was a 40% overall price rise which led to a near doubling of the cost per prison place for HMPP. This pushed total spending to £2.2 billion by March 2024.[19]

During the summer of 2024, the prison system came close to overflowing, prompting the current Labour Government to implement emergency early releases, reducing some offenders’ sentences to 40% of their original term.[20] Between September 2024 and June 2025, over 38,000 prisoners were freed early by the Government.[21]

Figure 4: Opinion on early release and prisons capacity[22]

Early release of prisoners is not a sustainable long-term solution to prison capacity issues – and it is highly unpopular with the public. Figure 4 shows a map of More in Common polling of public opinion of early release alongside prisons across the country and how close to capacity they are. This demonstrates a worrying picture.

Removing London, over 50% of the country disapproves of early releases. Some areas like the South West, North East and East Anglia register nearly 70% disapproval. And with prisons across the country between 95% and 100% capacity, early releases will become more and more frequent. Future scenes similar to August 2024 of released prisoners celebrating in the local area near the prison could create significant tension in communities.

Figure 5: Prison population and capacity projection in England and Wales by 2027[23]

Numerous projections, illustrated in Figure 5, indicate that by November 2027 at the latest, the prison population will exceed capacity, with estimated occupancy rates ranging from 101% to 113%. This underscores the pressing need for decisive action to prevent further early releases or the system reaching breaking point again.[24]

The number of erroneous early releases has increased at a staggering rate since 2024, as shown in Figure 6. While mistaken prison releases have been a long-standing issue as evidenced above, the spike since the current Government came to power is stark. The danger of this increased volume of mistaken early releases should not be underestimated and has been underscored in the last month with the release of two high-profile foreign national sex offenders. The former Chief Inspector of Prisons has said that the Government’s early release programme could be linked to a recent spike in cases.[25]

Figure 6 – Number of releases in error[26]

Foreign National Offenders

There is another route that the Government could take to free up space in prisons – improving the removal of FNOs. FNOs are individuals that are not British citizens and have been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK.

There are currently around 10,800 FNOs in prisons in England and Wales, which represents around 12% of the prison population.[27] As shown in Figure 7, the number of FNOs in our prisons is sharply increasing. There has been a 17% increase in the number of FNOs since 2019 and an almost 10% increase since the current Government came to power.[28]

Figure 7: Number of Foreign National Offenders in prison 2019-2024[29]

While many FNOs are housed across the general prison estate, there are also specific prisons that are exclusively used for FNOs. They are dedicated to offenders that are of interest to the Home Office who have between three and 36 months left to serve. Taken together, HMP Huntercombe, HMP Maidstone and HMP Morton Hall house nearly 1,400 FNOs – nearly a tenth of the total FNO population.[30]

If the current population of FNOs were to be removed from the prisons altogether, prisons in England and Wales would be operating at 86% capacity, compared to the 98% capacity they currently are.[31] While it is not feasible for the whole FNO population to be removed, this demonstrates the significance of the FNO population and the pressure it is putting on our prison capacity.

Figure 8 below shows the makeup of FNOs. The plurality of FNOs are Albanian citizens and this has been the case for several years. Polish, Romanian and Irish offenders follow closely.

Figure 8: Breakdown of Foreign National Offenders in prison 2019-2023[32]

With the FNO population in prisons in England and Wales taking up a significant proportion of capacity, their removal presents an opportunity to alleviate prison capacity significantly, preventing prisons being dangerously full.

It could also allow for significant savings on the amount the Government spends on foreign offenders, far beyond just the period the offender is in prison. Previous estimates have only looked at the cost of housing a prisoner for a year. For example, the TaxPayer’s Alliance calculated FNOs have cost around £600 million in the last year. It is worth noting that this figure is unusually high because the number of FNOs is beyond that of the Government’s official figures because offenders whose nationality was not recorded were assumed to be foreign born.[33] Other calculations that use the official FNO population statistics have estimated the cost to be around £530 million.[34]

Taking into consideration the cost of the prosecution process, prison time, court time and process, we have estimated the total cost of FNOs to the taxpayer at £3.2 billion since 2019/2020. And the cost has increased over the years, in particular since 2021/2022 as shown in Figure 9 below. Under the current Government, the cost of FNOs to the taxpayer is at an all-time high at almost £650 million per year – this is a 50% increase, over £200 million more, compared to 2019.[35]

Figure 9: Cost of Foreign National Offenders 2019-2025[36]

The Government finds itself in a precarious fiscal position with a £40 billion black hole and borrowing costs at a 27-year high.[37] There is little room for spending increases without tax rises. Onward analysis estimates that the cost of FNOs under this Government is equivalent to paying the salaries of over 20,000 new nurses or over 20,000 new teachers.[38] Likewise, it equates to the salaries of over 15,000 new police officers.[39] On the average starting salary, it is the same as the salaries of over 19,000 new prison officers.[40]

How can FNOs be removed?

Legal background

The legal backdrop to the removal of FNOs comes from two major pieces of legislation: the Immigration Act 1971 and the UK Borders Act 2007. The former originally intended for deportation to be discretionary in so far as, “a person would be liable to deportation if the Home Office decided it was conducive to the public good or a judge recommended it at the point of sentencing”. The latter places a statutory duty on the Home Secretary to make a deportation order on an FNO which has largely overtaken discretionary deportation decisions of the Immigration Act.[41]

Under the Borders Act, an FNO is defined as a “person who was not a British citizen or an Irish citizen who had been convicted of an offence in the UK and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months”. This means that the discretionary power of deportation as outlined in the Immigration Act was converted into a duty in relevant cases.[42] Irish citizens are excluded in the legislative definition of an FNO owing to the longstanding Common Travel Area arrangements that mean the UK does not routinely deport Irish citizens. They are nevertheless counted as foreign nationals in statistics on the nationality of prisoners in English and Welsh prisons.

Deportation of FNOs is not automatic. Exemptions, outlined in section 33 of the Act, include whether the offender was under 18 at the time of the crime or if it would breach the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the UN Refugee Convention or the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Beings.

There are two articles of the ECHR in particular that are frequently cited: Article 3 and Article 8. The former prohibits deportation if “there is a real risk that the person would be tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment”.[43] Article 8 protects the right to “respect for private and family life”. The articles are written into UK law under the Human Rights Act 1998. It has since been established that Article 8 can be used to challenge immigration decisions.[44]

These articles have different legislative footings. Article 3 is an absolute right, meaning it cannot be interfered with under any circumstances. Article 8 is a qualified right which means its application can be restricted if it is necessary for a legitimate aim, such as protecting public safety or other people’s rights. Maintaining effective immigration controls has been classified as a legitimate reason for interfering in Article 8. Butit is the decision of a judge to decide whether deportation is a proportionate interference with the rights awarded under Article 8. The judge must weigh up the rights of the individual against the interests of the respective country.

The precedent for how Article 8 is applied in the case of an FNO in the UK comes from two landmark cases: the 2004 R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and the 2007 case Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department.[45] These cases saw the shift from deferring to the judgement of the Home Office on whether a deportation or removal breached a person’s rights under the Human Rights Act to an independent assessment by immigration tribunal judges on the facts and proportionality of each case.

There were several key principles that were established in these cases. In Razgar, there were five stages of analysis that were established and then later endorsed in Huang. These were:

Is there interference with private or family life?

Is it in accordance with the law?

Is there a legitimate aim?

Is there interference necessary in a democratic society?

Is it proportionate to that aim?

In Huang, it was held that the immigration appeal tribunal must decide whether removal is proportionate under Article 8. Secondly, the court in this case established that tribunals should weigh the public interest in immigration control against the individual’s rights under Article 8. And finally, Huang confirmed that the immigration tribunal is the primary forum for deciding Article 8 proportionality.

Following the UK’s exit from the EU, FNOs from the EU are subject to different legal routes depending on the circumstances of their crime. EU citizens and family members with residence rights under the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 are exempt from automatic removal if their offence was undertaken before 31 December 2020.

Removal is instead decided under a framework derived from EU free movement law, which offers stronger protections against deportation. No particular length of prison sentence triggers deportation. With the exception of Irish citizens, if an EU citizen has committed a crime after 31 December 2020, they are liable to automatic deportation.

Prisons refer all cases involving FNOs to the Home Office’s Foreign National Offenders Returns Command (FNORC). An FNO who is not eligible for automatic deportation under the Borders Act can be considered on the grounds of their deportation being conducive to the public good. Deportation can be pursued on the ground of criminality if the person:

“has received a custodial sentence of 12 months or more for a single conviction for a single offence in the UK or overseas

has received combined sentences totalling 12 months or more in the UK or overseas

has been convicted in the UK or overseas of an offence which has caused serious harm

is a persistent offender”.[46]

Removal can also be pursued for the following reasons:

The offender is a threat to national security,

Court recommended deportation,

The person’s involvement in gun or serious drug crime regardless of the length of sentence received,

Regardless of if the person has not yet been convicted of a criminal offence, if there is evidence that the FNO’s conduct or presence in the UK has or will cause serious harm,

Involvement in a sham marriage.

Routes to removal

Currently, offenders can be removed from this country through various means including deportation; the early removal scheme; the facilitated return scheme; prisoner transfer agreements; and the tariff-expired removal scheme.

The early removal scheme is available to FNOs eligible for removal that are serving a fixed-term prison sentence and allows for the removal of FNOs at an “earlier point than would otherwise be possible for the sole purpose of removal or deportation from the UK”.[47] Once deported they cannot legally return to the UK, and are no longer subject to imprisonment and are free once back in their home country. The Home Office considers all cases, but in most cases prison governors are responsible for authorisation. Any prisoner can now be considered so long as their offence is not terror related. Similarly, the Tariff-Expired Removal Scheme applies to FNOs serving indeterminate sentences.[48]

FNOs under this scheme can be released up to four years before their earliest release date. This was originally 12 months, but it was increased in 2022 and has most recently been increased to 48 months this year under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.[49] So, the minimum pre-removal custodial period is now 30% compared to the previous 50%. The Government has recently stated their intention to remove the minimum requirement of sentence completion, meaning that FNOs could face immediate removal in the Sentencing Bill, which is likely to pass early next year.[50]

The facilitated return scheme is a voluntary programme run by the Home Office which offers money to help FNOs to resettle in their home country on the condition that they withdraw any appeals or applications to remain in the UK. This scheme is available to all FNOs liable for removal. A participant in the scheme can receive £1,500 if they are serving a custodial sentence or £750 if they have completed their sentence. The scheme is designed to “encourage FNOs to leave the UK at the earliest possible opportunity, thereby reducing the resources and costs associated with time spent in prison and immigration detention”.[51]

Prisoner transfer agreements allow for FNOs serving custodial sentences to be transferred to see out the rest of their sentence in their home country. This can be carried out if there is a reciprocal prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and the respective country. The UK has 110 such prisoner transfer agreements – they differ between countries with some requiring the consent of the prisoner, and some not.[52] Countries include Albania, France, Romania, Pakistan, Poland and the United States. Consent is generally required for these transfer agreements, but not always.

Figure 10: FNO deportations since 2010[53]

Removal history

The number of FNOs removed from the UK averaged around 5,500 per year during the period from 2010 to 2019. FNO returns reached a peak in 2016 at 6,437, subsequently falling to below 3,000 per year during the pandemic in 2020 to 2021. Since then, returns of FNOs have been gradually increasing, although in the latest year they were still 18% below the 2016 peak.[54]

The early removal scheme is responsible for around two fifths of FNO deportations from the UK. Between January 2010 and June 2022, around 12,800 people were removed under the facilitated return scheme, meaning it featured in approximately one in every five removals during that period.[55]

In total, the UK has removed 945 people to 50 countries and territories under prisoner transfer agreements from 2010 to 2023.[56] The net effect on prison spaces will be smaller, as some prisoners come to the UK from other countries under the same agreements.

In the year ending June 2025, there were 5,265 FNO returns, representing a 16% increase on the previous year – 48% were EU nationals and 52% were non-EU nationals. And in the period between 5 July 2024 and 31 January 2025, the early release scheme was responsible for over half of deportations.[57]

Figure 11: Breakdown of FNO returns by nationality 2021-2025[58]

As shown in Figure 11, FNO returns have been increasing in recent years. Removals of Albanian offenders have been the largest group of returns. They were steadily increasing until 2024 and took a slight downturn in the most recent year ending June 2025.

Building on the 2021 prisoner transfer agreement, the previous Conservative government signed a deal to send 200 Albanian prisoners to serve the balance of their sentences in Albania. In return, the UK helps Albania modernise its prisons. The deal outlined that the total cost for the Ministry of Justice to modernise Albanian prisons was around £8 million over two years.[59] This equated to £32 per prisoner per day – a significant saving compared to £109 per Albanian prisoner per day in prisons in England and Wales.[60]

As shown in Figure 12, between April 2008 and June 2021, just over a tenth of appeals against removal succeeded on human rights grounds. Home Office management data records 21,521 appeals in that period, of which 6,042 succeeded. Of the successful appeals, nearly 2,400 were successful on human rights grounds only.

Most of these are thought to be Article 8 cases as indicated by a subsequent review. Between 2016 and 2021, of 1,011 appeals against deportation by FNOs that were allowed on a human rights basis, nearly three-quarters were allowed solely on Article 8 grounds.[61]

Figure 12: FNO appeals against deportation 2008-2021[62]

Removals and the ECHR

While the UK’s future as a signatory of the ECHR continues to be debated, there are steps that can be taken to apply its protections more proportionately to domestic cases. The courts must also ensure that its application to protect the rights of FNOs is not infringing on the rights of UK citizens. In other words, if an FNO appealed deportation due to an infringement on their Convention rights under the Human Rights Act, would this jeopardise the safety of the public?

The Conservative party recently announced its intention to withdraw from the ECHR when in government and repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. This presents the opportunity for an entirely new legal framework free from having to align with Articles 3 or 8 that could radically increase deportations. However, the Labour Government has stated that it will not take the UK out of the ECHR. With over three and a half years until the next General Election must come and the prisons capacity crisis showing no signs of abating in the meantime, it is crucial to consider what other legislative changes could go some way towards increasing successful deportations of FNOs while the UK remains a signatory to ECHR.

As outlined above, Article 8 is a qualified right that was incorporated into the Human Rights Act from the ECHR. So, while the application of Article 3 cannot be changed as long as the UK remains in the ECHR, the Government can restrict the application of Article 8. And given that nearly three-quarters of appeals against removal that were granted to FNOs between 2008-2021 were on the grounds of Article 8, changing its application could radically increase FNO removals.

The Human Rights Act states that,

“There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”[63]

Looking at FNOs, there is a strong argument that interference with Article 8 would be in the interest of public safety, the prevention of disorder and crime, and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

The Government has done this before in 2014 and the current Government is in the process of building on this. The Cameron Government’s Immigration Act 2014 changed how Article 8 applications are handled, instructing courts and tribunals to prioritise the public interest in maintaining immigration control over an individual’s right to private and family life. This legislation also made it harder for FNOs to successfully challenge deportation with sentences of four or more years requiring “very compelling circumstances” and for shorter sentences, the claim needs to outweigh the public interest.[64]

Exceptions to deportation were also established in this legislation, including long-term lawful residence and integration for private life and where deportation would be ‘unduly harsh’ for a partner or child of the offender in question. It is important to note that ‘unduly harsh’ does not mean uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or difficult.[65]

Recommendations and conclusion

Recommendations

Recommendation 1 – The Government should introduce tougher legislation to tighten the application of Article 8 regardless of ECHR membership

Legislative action on the interpretation of Article 8 has been taken in the past, and the Government has signalled its intention to build on this. But it needs to go further. The rate at which Article 8 applications are successful clearly shows this is not working how it was intended. A recent example exemplifies this: an Albanian FNO’s deportation was halted partly because his son had an aversion to foreign chicken nuggets. An immigration tribunal cited it would be ‘unduly harsh’ for the FNO’s son to return to Albania due to his food sensitivities – the only example of which listed in court documents was “the type of chicken nuggets that are available abroad”.[66]

The de jure application of Article 8 under the Human Rights Act alone needs to be further restricted and de facto practice needs to be tightened to ensure it is being applied properly. The Government should therefore tighten the code published in 2014, making the following changes under Part 5A of the Immigration Act 2014:

1. Clarify that family life formed after conviction carries little weight – making Immigration Rule 398(c) statutory

Looking at whether deportation is proportionate under section 117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, considerations to family or private life should not be given any material weight after the commission of the offence unless exceptional circumstances exist.

In the Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60, it was stated that “The Rules are relevant to, but not determinative of, the proportionality assessment required by Article 8”.Putting this on a statutory footing would therefore give it equal weight to the Human Rights Act Article 8 clauses so it is binding rather than guiding.

It is worth noting that while Parliament can pass legislation instructing courts how to weight Article 8 rights relative to public safety, if it instructs to give no weight at all to relationships formed post-conviction (for example), it is likely the courts would make a declaration of incompatibility. And the UK government could get taken to Strasbourg itself for breach of Article 8 in a direct court action.

2. Replace “unduly harsh” with a higher threshold – align with ECtHR thresholds in Üner v Netherlands (2006), Jeunesse v Netherlands (2014) and Unuane v UK (2020)

As established above, if deportation would be ‘unduly harsh’ for a partner or child of the offender in question, this is a legitimate reason for appeal from the UK. But this precedent has been used in a disproportionate manner.

Üner v Netherlands (2006), Jeunesse v Netherlands (2014) and Unuane v UK (2020) cases looked at the proportionality of deporting FNOs in light of their private and family rights under Article 8 and the best interests of their children. They established that national authorities must conduct a proper proportionality assessment under Article 8.

In particular, Üner established the ‘Üner criteria’ which is a set of factors for courts to balance the public interest against private and family life rights – notably that removal can be allowed despite Article 8 rights if the public interstate is strong enough. And Unuane v UK ruled that the UK had breached Article 8 because it did not provide a proportionality assessment that “adequately considered the best interests of the children”. The case established that sufficient weight must be given to the negative impact on family life and that ‘unduly harsh’ requires a proper balancing exercise.

So, for the purpose of section 117C(5), the effect of deportation on a qualifying child or partner should be regarded as unduly harsh only if it would result in exceptional and irreversible harm to that person. The threshold should be raised so that it mirrors the exceptional and irreversible harm thresholds usually used in Strasbourg cases above.

3. Make very compelling circumstances apply to all offenders, not just those with 4 or more years sentences

A court or tribunal may not find that deportation is disproportionate under Article 8 unless satisfied that the case presents very exceptional circumstances compelling in nature, assessed against the strong public interest in removal.

Recommendation 2 – Introduce a Diversion Scheme

The Government should introduce a Diversion Scheme for lower-level crime committed by FNOs, in which these perpetrators are deported before they are convicted, as a substitute for incarceration. This should be applied to crimes that carry a sentence of up to two years.

There are some international examples of similar schemes. For example, the United States operates a pre-trial diversion policy under Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In this, the Attorney General may “permit any alien applicant for admission to withdraw his or her application for admission in lieu of removal proceedings… or expedited removal”.[67]

If the Department of Homeland Security uses an expedited removal, an inadmissibility bar (usually of five years) is applied to the alien in question. This carries no criminal conviction.[68] On the southern border, Border Patrol agents run a Consequence Delivery System (CDS) through which they find on the first apprehension of an alien, either federal prosecution or expedited removal are the most effective courses of action.[69]

The Home Office would retain information on FNO removal under the diversion policy so that FNOs in question would not be allowed to re-enter the country. This would not only prevent the FNO population in prisons in England and Wales from increasing, but it would also lessen the cost of FNOs.

Recommendation 3 – Remove the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme

Under the previous Conservative government, the minimum requirement was for an offender to have served 50% of their sentence, this was subsequently reduced to 30% under the Labour Government and is currently in place. As outlined above, the Government has signalled its intention to take this further and remove the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme altogether.

There is international precedent for this policy. For example, in Italy a ‘judicial expulsion’ can be ordered as an alternative to a current term of imprisonment or as a substitute penalty to imprisonment. Both are applicable to sentences of two years or less but only to crimes of irregular entry or stay in Italy.[70] In Spain, an FNO who has been sentenced to a custodial sentence of more than a year can have their sentence substituted by “expulsion from Spanish territory”. A judge can also order for part of the sentence to be served and substitute the rest of their sentence with expulsion.[71]

The Government should press ahead with the removal of the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme at an accelerated pace. Introducing this means that offenders who have not qualified for the Diversion Scheme, perhaps as they have chosen to go through the court process in the hopes they would not be convicted, can be removed at the earliest opportunity post-conviction. This policy alongside the Diversion Scheme allows for a comprehensive set of deportation levers for new offenders.

Recommendation 4 – Expand the ‘deport now, appeal later’ policy

Legislation passed in 2014 introduced the system known as ‘deport first, appeal later’. This policy means that the Government can send FNOs back to their home nation before they can appeal against the decision. They can be removed from the UK and they can have their appeal heard through a video link.

The current Government has recently expanded this list from the original eight countries to 23.[72] The list of countries that qualify for this policy are:

Albania

Angola

Australia

Belize

Botswana

Brunei

Bulgaria

Canada

Estonia

Finland

Guyana

India

Indonesia

Kenya

Kosovo

Latvia

Lebanon

Malaysia

Mauritius

Nigeria

Tanzania

Uganda

Zambia

Apart from Albania and Nigeria, this list omits the countries that are responsible for the majority of FNOs in prisons in England and Wales as shown in Figure 8. So, for this policy to be truly effective in decreasing the number of FNOs in prisons, this list needs to contain more of the countries outlined in Figure 8.

The remaining countries that make up the top 10 FNO nations are:

Poland

Romania

Ireland

Lithuania

Jamacia

Pakistan

Somalia

Portugal

The Home Secretary has the power to review and amend the countries on the deport now, appeal later list. Allowing removal before an appeal applies on a case-by-case basis, but being from a designated safe country strengthens the Home Secretary’s case for deportation. And Section 80AA list of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 already contains a list of countries the Home Office deems as safe.

Two actions should be taken to address this. First, the Home Office should put in place scheduled reviews of potential countries that could be added to the list. These reviews should happen at least bi-annually and should look at countries of interest:

The review should consider how effective adding this country would be in reducing the number of FNOs in English and Welsh prisons.

The safety of the home nation should be considered for both the FNO and possible dependants. The Home Office must ensure that there is no real risk of serious or irreversible harm to the individual or dependants if they are removed.

The viability of the home nation to conduct a fair remote appeal should be considered. This would include access to legal representation, sufficient internet access, diplomatic cooperation and arrangements, legal fairness and procedural safeguarding, and the assurance of no political interference.

Second, the remaining countries that are in the EU should be added immediately. Given that all EU countries fall within the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act’s safe countries, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, and Portugal are all already deemed as safe by the Home Office. And looking more broadly, based on 2023 prison population figures and the cost of incarceration in 2023, these FNOs cost the taxpayer over £124 million in 2023 alone. Therefore, as there is no real risk of serious harm to these offenders if they were deported and there is significant cost incurred by housing them in our prisons, these countries should be added to the ‘deport now, appeal later’ list at an accelerated pace.

Finally, for countries on this list that do not cooperate with the deportation policy, the Home Office should signal their intention to stop issuing new visas to countries to work as a diplomatic tool to encourage an increase in the volume of removals to these countries. There would be unintended consequences for non-offenders trying to seek legal settlement in the UK, so the Government should only stop issuing new visas as a last resort.

Conclusion

The prison population in England and Wales has reached dangerous levels in recent years and we cannot continue like this. And with inmate capacity across the prison estate at 98% in October 2025, the demand on our prisons is not being alleviated. There are several reasons our prisons have reached this tipping point: an increased backlog on the crown court due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tougher and therefore longer sentences have been on the rise since 2023 due to an increase in sentences for violent crimes, an increase in the number of offenders being recalled to prison, and a lack of prisons being built.

There is a clear group of inmates that should not be in our prisons: foreign national offenders (FNOs). Britain is not open to business for crime. But with English and Welsh prisons housing 10,800 foreign national offenders, one could be forgiven for thinking it is. What’s more, FNOs have cost the taxpayer over £3.2 billion since 2019 alone.

It is crucial for the integrity of our justice system, immigration system and tax system to send a clear message: if you come to this country and commit crime, you cannot stay. But on average, only 5,500 FNOs a year were removed from the UK between 2010 and 2019 – only around half of the annual FNO population.

Britain expects migrants to abide by our laws and should not tolerate it when that does not happen. So, more needs to be done to ensure this, and fast. This paper has identified several areas of FNO removal that need to change and recommends a series of pragmatic reforms to accelerate deportations:

The Government should introduce tougher legislation to tighten the application of Article 8 regardless of ECHR membership,

A Diversion Scheme should be introduced,

The Government should remove the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme,

And the Government should expand the ‘deport now, appeal later’ policy and stop issuing new visas to countries that do not comply.

In taking these steps and increasing the level of FNO deportations, this paper offers options to not only address the urgent issue of prison capacity but also alleviate the court backlog and reduce the associated cost.

Costings Methodological note

We used MoJ data to calculate the cost of legal aid per crime higher case.[73]

We used CPS data to calculate the average cost to the CPS of convicting someone.[74]

We used government data on the average cost per prisoner for each year from 2019/20 – 2023/24. We used an inflation calculator to estimate the cost for 2024/25 since figures are not available. Note that this data is the average cost per prisoner for a year’s stay in prison.

Used data from a written question in parliament to calculate cost to HMCTS for 1.4 sitting days.[75]

Found the number of FNOs per year (from 2019/20 – 2024/25).

Given that around 7% of determinate sentences come from the magistrates courts and the FNOs in question are all in prison, we have assumed they went through the Crown Courts.[76]

Adding the court costs for each year assumes that every FNO in prison undergoes a full court process within a given year – implying a custodial sentence of 12 months and no carryover. But given the average custodial sentence is 22 months, we have adjusted the total court costs by 55%.

To calculate how many new nurses salaries the 2024/25 FNO cost is equivalent to, we found the starting salary (£31,048).[77] And for new teachers, we took the average of the starting salaries for England excluding London (£31,650).[78] And for police officer salaries, we found the police starting salary (£40,776). And according to the Met Police, the average cost to train a police constable over the three year course is £210,000 – this includes wages and operating costs.[79] For prison officer salaries, we used HMPPS’ starting salary of £33,746.[80] These comparisons do not include non-pay associated costs.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the removal of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who was arrested in April, despite a judge attempting to help him evade arrest.

On April 18, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), assisted by deputized FBI law enforcement officials, carried out a targeted operation to arrest Flores-Ruiz, a violent criminal illegal alien at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. His laundry list of violent criminal charges includes strangulation and suffocation, battery, and domestic abuse.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested for obstructing the arrest of Flores-Ruiz. Judge Dugan intentionally directed ICE agents away from this criminal illegal alien to obstruct the arrest and try to help him evade arrest. Thankfully, our law enforcement chased down this violent illegal alien and arrested him. ICE removed this criminal on November 13, 2025.

“Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a previously removed illegal alien has a laundry list of violent criminal charges, including strangulation and suffocation, battery, and domestic abuse. Judge Hannah Dugan's actions to obstruct this violent criminal’s arrest take 'activist judge' to a whole new meaning,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Thanks to the brave men and women of ICE law enforcement, this criminal is OUT of our country. If you are here illegally and break the law, we will hunt you down, arrest you, and remove you from our country. That's a promise.”

Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem.
Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules, not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.
The court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.
But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.","The Transportation Department's new restrictions that would severely limit which immigrants can get commercial driver's licenses to drive a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court.

The court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can't be enforced right now.

The court said the federal government didn't follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to ""articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety."" The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver's licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said.

Duffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state's records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules, not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.

The court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.

The new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.

Catholic, Buddhist, Methodist, Lutheran and Unitarian faith leaders and members of their congregations gathered by candlelight to pray, sing hymns and share words of hope.

The service, hosted by Parish Family 45, coincided with the feast day of St. Frances Cabrini, the first U.S. citizen declared a saint and patron saint of immigrants.

Parish Family 45 combines three Catholic churches in Vancouver — Our Lady of Lourdes, St. James and St. Joseph. Carol Boyden, along with Dave Griffin and Charlene Stapleton, organized the event as a part of St. Joseph’s life, justice and peace organization.

Organizers chose the courthouse as the location for the prayer service to reinforce that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement isn’t acting legally, Boyden said.

“In my mind it is the ultimate irony for what we’re seeing in terms of (ICE) ignoring laws and everything else and dragging people away,” Boyden said.

“That’s what it means to me — people getting together and standing up for compassion, understanding and human rights,” Levy said.

Greg Stone, St. Joseph’s music director, played guitar and sang hymns on the courthouse steps.

“Just helping to lift hearts in a way that unites us through something, that is a real privilege for me,” Stone said.

In between hymns and prayers, Maribel Ramirez from St. Joseph spoke about how ICE activity is affecting the community.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit in July accusing the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. Immigrant advocates accused immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles said the ruling builds on a temporary order in July that required the government to provide detainees with access to free confidential phone calls with their lawyers.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The judge said that the plaintiffs had provided evidence that the government had not fully abided by the July order.

It required the detention facility to be open for attorney visitation seven days per week, for a minimum of eight hours per day on weekdays and a minimum of four hours per day on weekends and holidays. While the government has complied with that, the court also required officials to notify the plaintiffs in the lawsuit within four hours if they needed to close the detention facility for any reason, and that the closure not stretch longer than “reasonably necessary.”

“The Court has examined all of the new evidence presented by both sides and decides once again that the federal government is partially blocking access to lawyers,” Frimpong wrote in her order.

Mark Rosenbaum, an attorney with Public Counsel, said in an Oct. 23 hearing that lawyers were still having trouble meeting with their clients.

Attorneys did not begin receiving notice of any facility closures until Sep. 10. They often had to meet with clients with the door open and guards present, preventing the lawyers from having private conversations with clients. There have been instances where the facility was closed due to a peaceful protest that happened miles away in another city, Rosenbaum said.

Detainees have also been moved around frequently and without warning, sometimes from downtown Los Angeles to other locations that don't allow lawyer visits at all.

""By granting this preliminary injunction, the judge made clear that the government cannot lock people up and cut them off from their lawyers,” Rosenbaum said in a statement after the ruling.",https://images.wral.com/8a225a35-8c66-51c1-b21a-3cf607607fc6?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-11-15 15:57:38.729204

The GEO Group Operates Prisons in Australia, South Africa The GEO Group operates three prisons abroad: two in Australia and one in South Africa.","One of the largest private prison companies in the world, the GEO Group, is tied up in a Supreme Court battle as the company gains attention for contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

That case started in Aurora, which has played a key role in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan in more ways than one.

The GEO Group operates the Aurora Immigrant Processing Center, where ICE sends detainees facing deportation. The Florida-based company operates more than fifty similar facilities in the United States and abroad, managing more than 60,000 prisoners worldwide. It has a market value of about $2.4 billion and, at times, has ranked as the largest private prison company in the world, jostling with fellow U.S. federal contractor CoreCivic over the years.

On November 10, U.S. Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the case Menocal v. the GEO Group, which involves what kind of legal immunity the GEO Group has under federal prison contracts.

In 2014, Alejandro Menocal, a Mexican immigrant who lived in Golden before his arrest, worked in a dollar-a-day work program at the Aurora ICE facility while awaiting his deportation. Menocal was able to resolve his immigration case and stay in the U.S., but he wasn’t happy about the work program, alleging that the GEO Group underpaid him according to the state’s minimum wage laws, and violated forced labor and trafficking laws by threatening him and other inmates with solitary confinement for not doing tasks for free. In October 2014, other detainees from the Aurora facility signed onto a class-action lawsuit brought by Menocal against the GEO Group in the U.S. District Court of Colorado.

The GEO Group has argued that it is immune from the lawsuit because the company contracts with the federal government, and was only following ICE’s detailed instructions for how to handle detainees.

In 2015, a district court judge ruled that the GEO Group was not immune from the lawsuit, but claims that Menocal and others were underpaid were dismissed. The GEO Group still had to defend against alleged trafficking and forced labor violations, however.

No final ruling on the case has been made during the decade it has been in court, largely because the GEO Group filed motions raising questions about what specific powers federal contractors have. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Menocal v. the GEO Group, based on a petition filed by the GEO Group.

Justices are now weighing the question of whether federal contractors can file an immediate appeal to lawsuits. An immediate appeal challenges a court ruling before the case is concluded, as opposed to most appeals, which occur afterward. In this case, the GEO Group wants to appeal the district court’s decision to deny its immunity. The company has already lost huge sums in lawsuits in other states over the same dollar-a-day work program. (ADD LINK TO OTHER LAWSUITS)

As the case goes through the Supreme Court, here are seven things to know about the GEO Group:

Three years later, the WCC secured its first contract: a deal to design, build and manage an immigrant detention center for Immigration and Naturalization Services in the city of Aurora, Colorado, according to the GEO Group. The facility opened in May 1987.

In 2003, the WCC changed its name to the GEO Group as part of a deal by the Wackenhut Corporation to reacquire a large share of the company.

The GEO Group has been operating in Aurora for nearly fifty years, but the company has made more headlines since Trump returned to office in January. After Trump touted his mass deportation plan, which he dubbed “Operation Aurora” while on the campaign trail in Colorado in October 2024, the GEO Group has been busy investing $70 million to expand the Aurora facility in order to house upwards of 1,400 people at a time instead of the 300 it had usually held. According to Latino advocacy groups, ICE’s raids in Colorado have been the largest in the country.

ICE Relies on the GEO Group to Keep Immigrants Detained

ICE arrests immigrants and deports them, but the GEO Group handles the middle step of keeping them detained while ICE secures a removal order from a judge.

Despite the Aurora facility’s name, only about one or two ICE agents are inside the complex at a time, according to the federal agency. Although ICE denies entry to certain officials and outlines how the GEO Group should treat its detainees, most of the inside operations are handled by the GEO Group.

ICE has detained more than 60,000 people in the U.S. and hopes to increase its detention capacity to 100,000, according to reporting by the Washington Post. For Trump’s mass deportation to work, ICE needs places to put a city’s worth of detained immigrants behind bars while initiating removal proceedings in immigration court, a process that can be stalled at times.

According to reports, the Trump administration plans to open three new ICE detention facilities in the Colorado cities of Hudson, Walsenburg and Ignacio. Members of this state’s congressional delegation have confirmed that the GEO Group will likely reopen the private prison in Hudson, in northeastern Colorado, that held state prisoners from Alaska from 2009 to 2014.

From 1997 to 2010, rival CoreCivic operated the facility that ICE is expected to use in Walsenburg. The two facilities would be about the size of Aurora’s ICE detention center, with between 1,100 to 1,400 beds.

Ignacio is on the Southern Ute Reservation; the tribe released a statement in August that it had no agreement with ICE to allow a new detention facility.

The GEO Group Offers a “Turnkey” Suite of Detention Services

On the GEO Group’s website, the company says it offers “turnkey solutions” for incarceration. Ironically, “turnkey” is a seventeenth-century English term for jailer, but the GEO Group is using it to offer everything needed from the ground up. The company boasts that it doesn’t just provide the detention center guards: The company designs the facility, finances it, builds it, cleans it, transports the inmates, feeds them and sets up any classes or work programs required inside.

The GEO Group also offers services for people who are out of detention but still under supervision, like electronic tracking devices made by BI Incorporated, a Boulder-based company. The GEO Group also operates nonresidential and residential re-entry centers, sometimes called halfway houses, which are supervised housing or work programs for people leaving incarceration.

ICE Contracted with the GEO Group After Its Own Name Change

The GEO Group has been running the Aurora facility since 1987, but the contract moved from the INS to ICE in 2004, less than a year after Congress bumped ICE from being a post-9/11 bureau to a partial replacement for the INS.

The INS had been around since 1933, and references to it often pop up in older TV shows and films, like in 1993’s Coneheads, in which INS agents are the main villains. The INS was the country’s primary immigration enforcement arm for seventy years. Along with the Border Patrol, the INS led some of the largest deportation efforts in the U.S., like Operation Wetback. After 9/11, the U.S. created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and removed the INS, which was a part of the Justice Department, entirely.

The DHS was broadly put in charge of protecting U.S. soil and borders, with agencies like FEMA, the Secret Service and the Coast Guard stuffed into it. The INS’s responsibilities were split among three agencies: Border Patrol (which had been around longer than the INS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE.

While the Border Patrol is charged with making sure that no one crosses borders illegally and CBP with making sure nothing dangerous gets through legal entryways, ICE handles the immigrants already in the country. ICE was largely seen as the successor to the INS, and the main source of the country’s immigration enforcement agents.

ICE now has a $45 billion annual budget after it was allocated more money in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which includes funds to build more detention facilities.

The GEO Group Is No Stranger to Lawsuits

For the past few decades, the GEO Group has been a consistent target of lawsuits and has spent millions on settlements.

The federal government sued the company in 2010 over claims that male managers sexually harassed female employees at a prison in Arizona, resulting in a $140,000 settlement by the GEO Group in 2013, and then another $60,000 payment three years later to settle another claim in the same case. Then, the GEO Group paid $550,000 to comply with a consent decree that resulted from more claims involving the same sexual harassment suit, known as EEOC and ACRD v. the GEO Group.

In 2015, the GEO Group paid $50,000 to settle a First Amendment case brought by Prison Legal News, which claimed the company censored its coverage of the New Castle Correctional Facility in Indiana.

In 2017, Iranian immigrant Kamyar Samimi died in the Aurora ICE facility after being cut off from methadone. The ACLU of Colorado sued the GEO Group for wrongful death, resulting in a confidential settlement between the GEO Group and Samimi’s family in 2020.

In 2021, a federal jury ordered the GEO Group to pay $17 million in back wages to detainees at a Tacoma ICE facility for the same dollar-a-day program involved in the Aurora case. An appellate court upheld that ruling in January and increased the payout to $23 million.

In 2022, Nicaraguan immigrant Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza died in the Aurora ICE facility from a pulmonary embolism. Two years later, his family filed a wrongful death suit, which is still ongoing.

In July, Congressman Jason Crow sued the Trump administration and DHS after being denied entry to the Aurora ICE facility. That lawsuit is ongoing, but the GEO Group isn’t liable in that case.

The GEO Group Operates Prisons in Australia, South Africa

The GEO Group operates three prisons abroad: two in Australia and one in South Africa.

The Fulham and Ravenhall correctional centers in Australia, both in the southeastern state of Victoria, are medium-security male prisons. Ravenhall, located next to Melbourne, can hold about 1,300 people, making it one of the largest correctional centers in that country. Fulham holds about 900 people and is further east, in a more rural area.

In South Africa, the GEO Group co-runs the Kutama Sinthumule Correctional Center, a 3,000-bed maximum-security male prison. In this public-private partnership, the GEO Group helped build and manage the facility, which is publicly owned and located in a rural northeastern part of the country. A riot broke out there in 2023, and a major fire led to a partial shutdown.

The Geo Group’s three international detention facilities handle criminal offenders incarcerated in their own countries. Stateside, most of the detention facilities that the GEO Group manages are for immigrants facing deportation, who haven’t been criminally charged by the U.S. These immigrants might face charges in their own country, but they’re held in facilities like the Aurora detention center for civil immigration violations. Unlike the detention centers in the U.S., none of the international facilities hold women.

Just a few days before Vizguerra’s arrest in mid-March, ICE arrested Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil in New York and then transferred him to a GEO Group detention center in Louisiana. Khalil’s arrest drew international attention because he was a leader in pro-Palestine protests the previous year. Khalil was released by a federal judge’s ruling in June.

Activist Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino was arrested in June; his supporters say he was arrested because he’s a prominent farmworker organizer. Sent to a facility run by the GEO Group, he chose to return to Mexico soon after.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has ordered federal prosecutors to provide examples of ""unusual judicial system obstacles"" they have faced during criminal or civil proceedings tied to immigration, assaults on law enforcement or ""antifa,"" according to a government email reviewed by Reuters.

The highly unusual request to collect examples of what the department sees as judicial pushback was sent on Thursday evening by a senior official in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office to U.S. Attorneys.

It suggests an escalation in a series of confrontations between federal district courts and the Trump administration.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly called judges who have ruled against his administration ""crooked,"" ""conflicted"" and ""rogue."" Many of the judges have been subjected to threats or harassment after issuing rulings against the Trump administration.

A Justice Department spokesperson, when asked on Friday to comment on the email, reiterated criticism of certain judges' actions.

""Across the country, judicial activists - liberals in robes - continue to obstruct lawful efforts to protect the American people, even in cases where the Supreme Court has already made the law unmistakably clear,"" the spokesperson said.

""The department is committed to strengthening our litigation posture at every level so we can better defend public safety initiatives and prevent activist judges from undermining the rule of law.""

In the email, Blanche's office instructed each U.S. attorney's office to provide two to three examples of judges posing challenges to Justice Department efforts to obtain search warrants or signatures on criminal complaints, get approval on jury instructions, or obtain pre-trial detention.

It asked prosecutors to focus on cases related to assaults against federal agents, particularly if they involved immigration enforcement or investigations into anti-fascist movement groups known as ""antifa,"" which the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist organization.

The email did not indicate what the Justice Department intends to do with the information, which prosecutors were asked to submit by midday on Friday.

The email comes shortly after Blanche appeared at an event hosted by the conservative Federalist Society, where he made fiery remarks about federal district court judges.

""They have a robe on but they are more political or certainly as political as the most liberal governor or D.A.,"" Blanche said.

""There's a group of judges that are repeat players, and that's obviously not by happenstance, that's intentional, and it's a war, man.""

A group of 50 retired judges criticized his comments, saying his rhetoric ""poses a grave threat to the rule of law and the judiciary.""

Federal judges across the country have increasingly raised concerns over the legality of Trump administration policies on matters ranging from immigration to the targeting of medical practitioners who provide gender-affirming care to transgender youth.

Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg earlier this year concluded the Trump administration appeared to have acted in bad faith when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights on March 15 at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess the legality of the action.

Boasberg found probable cause to hold the government in criminal contempt and launched an investigation to determine who was responsible, but a federal appeals court later tossed out his ruling in a 2-1 decision.

The case will now proceed, with the tribunal retaining authority to manage how any national security issues are addressed.","Pitasanna Shanmugathas is a third-year student at the University of Windsor Faculty of Law. He has been actively following developments in this discrimination case before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.

A Canadian Human Rights Tribunal member ruled last week that the government cannot invoke national security laws to indefinitely delay discrimination complaints. The Tribunal decision comes as a victory for a former refugee who says Canada’s Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) exploited and discriminated against him for more than two decades.

Kagusthan Ariaratnam—a Tamil former refugee from Sri Lanka who was forced to join a militant group as a child soldier—alleges that CSIS coerced him to work for nine years as an unpaid informant. He also contends that the agency shared his private mental health records with prospective employers, sabotaging his efforts to secure work elsewhere.

Ariaratnam says CSIS refused to hire him despite his qualifications and experience, even as the agency continued to benefit from intelligence tips he provided about Tamil militant organizations. He also asserts that the agency discriminated against him based on his race, ethnicity, religious identity as a Muslim, and mental health conditions—including depression, and what he describes as false diagnoses of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which he argues resulted from CSIS inaccurately telling police and doctors that he was delusional when he was, in fact, following their instructions.

After filing a complaint in January 2018, Ariaratnam says it took more than six years for the complaint to reach the tribunal, and he was unable to submit detailed allegations until February 2025. At that time, CSIS asked the Canadian government to invoke the national security doctrine, which would transfer the case to a different oversight body: the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA).

Both CSIS and the Canadian Human Rights Commission argued that this move would pause the tribunal proceedings indefinitely, allowing NSIRA to complete its review, after which the commission would decide whether to return the case to the tribunal—a process with no clear timeline.

Tribunal Member Ashley Bressette-Martinez rejected the argument advanced by CSIS and the Human Rights Commission, finding the law is silent on whether tribunal proceedings should be paused when agencies invoke national security laws. Reasoning that such power conflicts with the tribunal’s independence from the commission, she determined that once a case reaches the tribunal, it belongs to the complainant—not the government agencies involved.

“The power to withdraw a complaint before the Tribunal belongs to a complainant and no other party has that power,” Bressette-Martinez wrote.

Ariaratnam’s lawyer, Nicholas Pope, told JURIST in an exclusive interview that Bressette-Martinez’s decision blocks a delay tactic commonly used by agencies. “It’s quite common for federal agencies to invoke national security in human rights cases involving CSIS or immigration matters with individuals from areas of the world that the government stereotypes as being affiliated with terrorism,” Pope explained. “This decision limits the use of NSIRA as a tool to delay human rights proceedings.”

Ariaratnam told JURIST his seven-year legal battle has devastated him financially and emotionally. “I have spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees. There were moments I felt completely alone and defeated, especially when the process dragged on for years without progress,” he said. “But I kept going because I knew what happened to me was wrong.”

The allegations at issue date back to events that began in 2000. At that time, Ariaratnam says a CSIS agent threatened to report him to immigration authorities if he refused to become an informant. The agent allegedly promised to hire him once he became a permanent resident in 2002. Despite this promise, CSIS never hired him, even after he repeatedly applied for about 22 years, according to his complaint.

In 2016, Ariaratnam had applied for a security guard position on Parliament Hill. He explained that CSIS shared his confidential mental health information with House of Commons officials, who then cancelled his security clearance application. A 2020 NSIRA report confirms that CSIS representatives met with House officials and shared with them Ariaratnam’s mental health records.

“My medical history had nothing to do with my ability to perform the job,” Ariaratnam stated. “It was shared without my consent and used to deny me a security clearance—effectively branding me as ‘unfit’ because of my mental health status.”

In his complaint, Ariaratnam seeks $3.8 million in damages. Pope says the complaint’s central claim is straightforward: “His CSIS handler promised him that he would be hired once he obtained his permanent residency, and she said he had the suitable skills. Then he was not hired despite applying multiple times.”

The tribunal noted that pausing the proceedings could be illogical if it ultimately resolved the pending dispute over which allegations should be included in the case—an outcome that could eliminate the national security concerns entirely.

The case will now proceed, with the tribunal retaining authority to manage how any national security issues are addressed.

The federal government has not publicly announced the move. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said he was informed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection could start an enforcement operation Saturday or soon after the weekend.

It would be another step in the Trump administration's strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of some of America's largest cities run by Democrats. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who don't have legal status in the U.S., and sparked a number of lawsuits challenging the tactics.

Here’s what to know:

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina's two U.S. senators are Republican and President Donald Trump won the state all three times that he's run for office.

Crime was down this year, through August, compared to the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has used the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train as evidence that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

Critics have described the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They’re also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully"" and ""reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in operations by Customs and Border Protection.

There is no sign that the National Guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina's congressional delegation have urged Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to make that request.

The governor's office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the Guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. A judge so far has stopped the Guard from working in the Chicago area.

Between 40% and 42% of Americans say ICE often uses unnecessary physical force against citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants.","The Trump administration has significantly increased funding and hiring for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). On its website, the agency has touted ""record-breaking immigration enforcement in the US interior"" since the start of the Trump administration. However, this increase in activity has coincided with many of ICE's actions being deemed unlawful by judges. Most notably, ICE deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a country he had fled due to gang violence — as a result of an ""administrative error."" YouGov polling in April found that a majority of Americans thought Abrego Garcia should be returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. ICE's tactics have met with resistance, sparking protests across the country. What do Americans think about ICE's actions across the country?

Last month, YouGov polling found that a majority of Americans disapprove of how ICE is handling its job. About half of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful and are concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. One half or more of Americans think that ICE wrongfully arrests, deports, and uses unnecessary force against both U.S. citizens and immigrants. Americans are more likely to approve than to disapprove of protests against ICE.

A majority of Americans disapprove of ICE

A majority (53%) of Americans somewhat or strongly disapprove of how ICE is handling its job. Only 39% approve. Both Democrats and Independents are much more likely to disapprove than to approve of ICE (85% vs. 12% among Democrats and 62% vs. 25% among Independents). In contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly approve of the agency's job handling: 79% approve and 13% disapprove.

The high rate of disapproval of ICE may stem in part from concerns about the agency's tactics. Half (52%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. Only 26% say that its tactics are about right and 11% say that they are not forceful enough.

Majorities of both Democrats (86%) and Independents (60%) say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. But only 12% of Republicans think ICE is too forceful; 52% say ICE's tactics are about right. Those who think ICE's tactics are not forceful enough are in the minority in all three groups: 1% of Democrats, 8% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans.

Americans are not simply concerned about ICE's tactics in the abstract: Nearly half (46%) of Americans are somewhat or very concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. That's roughly the same as the share who are not very or not at all concerned (47%).

Three-quarters (75%) of Democrats are concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. Half (50%) of Independents are concerned as well, more than the 39% who are not very or not at all concerned. Only 16% of Republicans are concerned ICE could mistreat someone they know; most (78%) are not very or not at all concerned.

Most Hispanic (72%) and Black (65%) Americans are concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. Concern among white Americans is less widespread (38%, vs. 57% who are not very or not at all concerned).

About half of Americans support protests against ICE

Americans are more likely to somewhat or strongly approve than disapprove of protests against ICE actions (48% vs. 39%). Majorities of Democrats (76%) and Independents (55%) approve of protests against ICE actions, with small shares disapproving (12% of Democrats and 28% of Independents). Most Republicans disapprove of anti-ICE protests (76%, compared to 13% who approve).

Majorities think that ICE mistreats citizens and immigrants

Majorities of Americans say that ICE sometimes or often arrests U.S. citizens (55%) and immigrants who are authorized to live in the U.S. (61%) who have not committed any immigration or customs violations. Far smaller shares of Americans think that ICE rarely or never wrongfully arrests U.S. citizens (31%) and authorized immigrants (29%).

Large majorities of Democrats think ICE sometimes or often wrongfully arrests U.S. citizens (84%) and authorized immigrants (86%). Majorities of Independents say the same (58% about citizens and 68% about immigrants) but only small shares of Republicans do (24% and 29%). Majorities of Republicans think ICE rarely or never wrongfully arrests U.S. citizens (61%) or authorized immigrants (60%).

Americans are only slightly less likely to say ICE wrongfully deports people. About half (51%) of Americans say ICE sometimes or often deports U.S. citizens who have not committed any immigration or customs violations, and a majority (56%) say the same about authorized immigrants.

Large majorities of Democrats say that ICE sometimes or often wrongfully deports U.S. citizens (78%) and authorized immigrants (87%). Majorities of Independents also say U.S. citizens (53%) and authorized immigrants (61%) are sometimes or often wrongfully deported but only small shares of Republicans do (23% and 22%). About two-thirds of Republicans say that U.S. citizens (64%) are rarely or never wrongfully deported and a similar proportion (67%) say the same about authorized immigrants.

Majorities of Americans say that ICE sometimes or often uses unnecessary physical force in its interactions with U.S. citizens (59%), authorized immigrants (60%), and immigrants who are not authorized to live in the U.S. (64%). For each of these three groups, less than one-third of Americans say ICE rarely or never uses unnecessary force (30% against citizens, 29% against authorized immigrants, and 27% against unauthorized immigrants).

Most Democrats and Independents think that ICE uses unnecessary physical force. For each of the three groups — citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants — about 90% of Democrats, about two-thirds of Independents, and between about one-quarter and one-third of Republicans say ICE uses unnecessary force. Republicans are more likely to say that ICE rarely or never uses unnecessary force: 62% say unnecessary force is rarely used against citizens, 60% against authorized immigrants, and 56% against unauthorized immigrants.

About the same shares of Americans think ICE uses unnecessary physical force against U.S. citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants at various frequencies. Americans are slightly more likely to say ICE uses unnecessary force against unauthorized immigrants and a bit less likely to say it uses unnecessary force against citizens. However, these differences are very small, rendering them statistically insignificant.

Between 40% and 42% of Americans say ICE often uses unnecessary physical force against citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants. This narrow range (2 percentage points) is within the survey's margin of error. There are similarly narrow ranges in the shares saying ICE sometimes (19% to 22%), rarely (17% to 19%) and never (10% to 11%) uses unnecessary force against each of the three groups.

Americans are less likely to approve of ICE after being asked about ICE's treatment of U.S. citizens

To avoid biasing respondents, we randomized the order in which panelists were asked questions about the treatment of different groups. Some panelists were randomly assigned to first answer questions about ICE's treatment of U.S. citizens, then about their general evaluations of ICE, then about authorized immigrants. Others were first asked about ICE's treatment of authorized immigrants, then their evaluations of ICE, then about U.S. citizens. (All panelists were asked the single question about the treatment of unauthorized immigrants last.)

This methodology was intended to reduce any bias that may come from having just been prompted to think about either citizens or immigrants. It also served as an experiment that allows us to understand how being asked first about ICE's treatment of citizens or of immigrants affects overall evaluations of ICE.

We find that being shown questions about ICE's treatment of citizens makes Americans more likely to disapprove of the agency, compared to questions about treatment of authorized immigrants. Americans who were asked about their evaluation of ICE after questions about ICE's treatment of U.S. citizens were 7 percentage points more likely to disapprove of ICE than those who had just seen questions about ICE's treatment of authorized immigrants (56% vs. 49%) and 5 percentage points less likely to approve (36% vs. 41%). This effect goes in the same direction among Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. In all three groups, respondents who were first asked about ICE's treatment of citizens were between 5 and 7 percentage points more likely to disapprove of ICE than those who were first asked about authorized immigrants.

Americans are more likely to disapprove than to approve of ICE regardless of whether its treatment of citizens or immigrants is fresh in their minds. However, seeing questions about ICE's treatment of citizens significantly worsens evaluations of the agency. Note that, unlike in some experiments, this survey did not introduce any new information to respondents. We only asked them to share their own opinions in a different order. This suggests that high-profile instances of ICE detaining, arresting, injuring, or shooting U.S. citizens could be particularly damaging to the agency's reputation, as making ICE's treatment of citizens more salient to Americans appears to make them more likely to disapprove of ICE.

I don’t combine them.” Her husband, Strategy Group CEO Ben Yoho, didn’t respond to questions.
This is not the first time that the Strategy Group has gotten public money through a Noem contract.
The DHS ad that the company filmed at Mount Rushmore has aired during “Fox & Friends” in recent days.
The contracts total $220 million so far, leading the DHS ad budget to triple in the most recent fiscal year, according to Bloomberg.","This story was originally published by ProPublica.

On Oct. 2, the second day of the government shutdown, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem arrived at Mount Rushmore to shoot a television ad. Sitting on horseback in chaps and a cowboy hat, Noem addressed the camera with a stern message for immigrants: “Break our laws, we’ll punish you.”

Noem has hailed the more than $200 million, taxpayer-funded ad campaign as a crucial tool to stem illegal immigration. Her agency invoked the “national emergency” at the border as it awarded contracts for the campaign, bypassing the normal competitive bidding process designed to prevent waste and corruption.

The Department of Homeland Security has kept at least one beneficiary of the nine-figure ad deal a secret, records and interviews show: a Republican consulting firm with long-standing personal and business ties to Noem and her senior aides at DHS. The company running the Mount Rushmore shoot, called the Strategy Group, does not appear on public documents about the contract. The main recipient listed on the contracts is a mysterious Delaware company, which was created days before the deal was finalized.

Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

No firm has closer ties to Noem’s political operation than the Strategy Group. It played a central role in her 2022 South Dakota gubernatorial campaign. Corey Lewandowski, her top adviser at DHS, has worked extensively with the firm. And the company’s CEO is married to Noem’s chief spokesperson at DHS, Tricia McLaughlin.

The Strategy Group’s ad work is the first known example of money flowing from Noem’s agency to businesses controlled by her allies and friends.

Government contracting experts said the depth of the ties between DHS leadership and the Strategy Group suggested major potential violations of ethics rules.

“It’s corrupt, is the word,” said Charles Tiefer, a leading authority on federal contract law and former member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said that the Strategy Group’s role should prompt investigations by both the DHS inspector general and the House Oversight Committee.

“Hiding your friends as subcontractors is like playing hide the salami with the taxpayer,” Tiefer added.

Federal regulations forbid conflicts of interest in contracting and require that the process be conducted “with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none.”

“It’s worthy of an investigation to ferret out how these decisions were made, and whether they were made legally and without bias,” said Scott Amey, a contracting expert and general counsel at the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight.

The revelations come as the amount of money at Noem’s disposal has skyrocketed. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill granted DHS more than $150 billion, and Noem has given herself an unusual degree of control over how that money is spent. This summer, she began requiring that she personally approve any payment over $100,000.

Asked about the Strategy Group’s work for DHS, McLaughlin, the agency spokesperson, said in an interview, “We don’t have visibility into why they were chosen.”

“I don’t know who they’re a subcontractor with, but I don’t work with them because I have a conflict of interest and I fully recused myself,” she said. “My marriage is one thing and work is another. I don’t combine them.” Her husband, Strategy Group CEO Ben Yoho, didn’t respond to questions.

In a written statement, DHS said, “DHS has no involvement with the selection of subcontractors.” They added that the Strategy Group does not have a direct contract with the agency, saying “DHS cannot and does not determine, control, or weigh in on who contractors hire.”

Contracting experts said that agencies can and do sometimes require that subcontractors be approved by officials. It’s not clear how much the Strategy Group has been paid.

This is not the first time that the Strategy Group has gotten public money through a Noem contract. As governor of South Dakota in 2023, her administration set off a scandal by hiring the Ohio-based company to do a different ad campaign, paying it $8.5 million in state funds. While the state said the contract was done by the book, a former Noem administration official told ProPublica that Noem quietly intervened to ensure the Strategy Group got the deal. ProPublica granted some people anonymity to discuss the deals because of their sensitivity.

The firm also paid up to $25,000 to one of Noem’s closest advisers in South Dakota, previously unreported records show. (The adviser, 28-year-old Madison Sheahan, now serves at DHS as the second-in-command of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Sheahan didn’t respond to questions about why she was paid.)

The DHS ad that the company filmed at Mount Rushmore has aired during “Fox & Friends” in recent days. Executives from the Strategy Group traveled to the shoot and hired subcontractors to fill out the film crew, according to records and a person involved in the campaign. The ad’s aesthetic sits somewhere between a political campaign ad and a Jeep commercial as Noem tells would-be immigrants to “come here the right way.”

“From the cowboys who tamed the West to the titans who built our cities,” Noem says, as images of Trump Tower in Chicago and Trump raising his fist after the assassination attempt last year flash on the screen, “America has always rewarded vision and grit.” Noem continues: “You cross the border illegally, we’ll find you.”

The ad is the latest in a campaign that Noem debuted in February, just a few weeks after she took charge of DHS. “Any delay in providing these critical communications to the public will increase the spread of misinformation, especially misinformation by smugglers,” the agency wrote, explaining why it was skipping the competitive bidding process normally required for government contracts. The initial ads featured Noem thanking Trump for securing the border.

The contracts total $220 million so far, leading the DHS ad budget to triple in the most recent fiscal year, according to Bloomberg. The lion’s share of ad contracts is typically used to buy TV airtime or spots on social media. Advertising firms make money by taking an often-hefty commission. Federal records show the contracts have gone to two firms. One is a Republican ad company in Louisiana called People Who Think, which has been awarded $77 million.

But the majority of the money — $143 million — has gone to a mysterious LLC in Delaware. The company was created just days before it was awarded the deal.

Little is known about the Delaware company, which is called Safe America Media and lists its address as the Virginia home of a veteran Republican operative, Michael McElwain. McElwain has long had his own advertising company (separate from the Delaware one), but there’s little evidence that firm could handle a nine-figure federal contract on its own: It reported just five employees when it received COVID-19 relief money a few years ago.

How, where and to whom Safe America Media doled out the $143 million is unknown. Any subcontractors hired to do work on the DHS ads are not disclosed in federal contracting databases.

The office funding the ad contracts is listed as the DHS Office of Public Affairs, which is run by McLaughlin, contract records show. McLaughlin married Yoho, the Strategy Group CEO, earlier this year.

In its statement, DHS said the agency does its contracting “by the book” and the process is run by career officials. “It is very sad that Pro Publica would seek to defame these public servants,” DHS added.

Asked about why the agency chose Safe America Media, DHS said, “The results speak for themselves: the most secure border in American history and over 2 million illegal aliens exiting the United States.” McElwain and People Who Think didn’t respond to questions.

Yoho was still in college when he first served as campaign manager for a U.S. congressman. Now, at 38 years old, he’s a national player in the cutthroat industry of political advertising. Federal election records show tens of millions in payments to his firm during the 2024 election cycle, coming from dozens of Republican congressional candidates. And Noem has proved a particularly lucrative client.

Lewandowski brought Yoho into Noem’s inner circle back in South Dakota, according to two people familiar with the matter, putting the young consultant in charge of the ad side of her 2022 gubernatorial reelection campaign. Noem had a more than $5 million advertising budget for the race, records show. After she won in a landslide, Yoho, who has called Noem a friend, came to South Dakota to attend her inauguration ceremony. He sat off to the side of the stage, next to Lewandowski. (Lewandowski didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

By then, Yoho’s next big project with Noem was already in the works. In late 2022, Noem was quietly preparing to launch another sprawling ad campaign — only this time, the money would come from state coffers. The stated goal was to encourage workers to move to South Dakota. The upcoming contract opportunity wasn’t public yet, but Yoho was already involved in planning the campaign, according to records first reported by Sioux Falls Live.

Then on Jan. 12, 2023, Yoho’s company registered to do business in South Dakota under the name Go West Media. The next day, the contract opportunity went live.

Seven companies submitted proposals for the project. Then the pressure from above set in, according to a former Noem administration official involved in the process.

The former official said a top Noem aide told them the governor would be angry if Yoho’s company didn’t win the contract. “He was very direct: ‘She wants to do it,’” they said. Contemporaneous text messages reviewed by ProPublica corroborate that senior Noem administration officials pushed for Yoho to get the contract. Eventually, he did. (In its statement, DHS denied that Noem influenced the process.)

Noem starred in Yoho’s ads herself, dressing up as a dentist, a plumber and a state trooper as she touted her state’s growing economy. Exactly how much Yoho and the Strategy Group made off the $8.5 million deal is unclear. Some of the money was used to purchase spots on Fox News, including one during a Republican presidential debate. Some of the money appears to have gone back to South Dakota — into the bank account of another of Noem’s top advisers.

Sheahan, now the second-in-command at ICE, was paid up to $25,000 by Go West in 2023 for “consulting,” according to a financial disclosure document Sheahan later filed. At the time, Sheahan was serving as both the operations director for Noem as governor and the political director for Noem’s campaign work, according to a copy of her 2023 resume obtained by ProPublica. Her responsibilities included coordinating “daily logistics and operations” for Noem and her team, the resume said. She also managed the “relationship with high level donors” to American Resolve, Noem’s network of outside political groups.

As his firm received millions from the South Dakota state government, Yoho separately continued to work for Noem in other capacities. He worked under Lewandowski on the publicity campaign for Noem’s 2024 memoir, according to a person familiar with the matter. (The book became famous for including an anecdote about Noem shooting her dog.)

The Strategy Group also received a stream of payments for social media consulting and media production work over the last few years from Noem’s American Resolve PAC. Federal election records show the PAC made its last payment to Yoho’s company this February, a couple weeks after Noem took her post as the head of DHS.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-Noem-MN-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 11:00:02.669059

Arizona state representative Raquel Terán told Fox 10 Phoenix that Jose Barco, a Venezuelan-born veteran whose family fled Cuba as refugees, was deported at 4am from Arizona.

Anna Stout, a volunteer on Barco’s defense team, told Denver 7 his team was not notified of plans for his deportation.

Barco’s family has still not received confirmation of Jose’s current location as of Friday evening. “We have not received word from Jose or from anyone else with firsthand knowledge that he has actually arrived in Nogales. We only have the official statement from ICE to go on, but no confirmation of Jose’s current location,” his family said in a statement.

“Jose was not able to reach out to his family before any of this initiated,” she told the news outlet, adding that the process has been “frustrating”.

Immigration enforcement told Fox 10 that Barco was deported to Nogales in Mexico.

The court previously ordered for his removal to either Venezuela, Cuba or Mexico.

Barco’s father was a political dissident in Cuba who spoke out against communism, forcing his family to flee to Venezuela in the 1980s. Four years after Barco was born, his family entered the US with asylum, and were later given lawful permanent resident status.

Barco enlisted in the army at 17 and served two tours in Iraq. Barco was injured by an improvised explosive device during one of his deployments, and received a Purple Heart for his service in combat. He was also awarded a Combat Infantry Badge.

During his military career, Barco had filled out paperwork for citizenship, but his application was never processed for an unknown reason, despite his submitting it. His legal team says his former commander attests to helping him complete and submit the application.

Barco, 39, served 15 years in prison for a felony conviction of attempted murder. In October 2009, Barco was sentenced to 52 years after being convicted of firing a gun at a house party in Colorado Springs. He was suffering from PTSD. One of the bullets he fired hit a 19-year-old woman in the leg.

Barco was released on parole this January after serving 15 years due to good behavior. Upon release, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained Barco and took him to a detention center in Colorado.

In September, an immigration judge denied Barco’s relief appeals, which included an application for asylum, and ordered for the veteran’s removal from the US without specifying a date.

Stout said the last few hours have been brutal for Barco’s family and loved ones.

“The fact he is being removed from the country where he was raised and that he fought and bled for is devastating to begin with, but the uncertainty of where he is, not knowing which country they would be deporting him to, and being denied access to him – including for his legal team – has made a horrific situation so much worse.

Most families know at a minimum where their loved ones will be deported to when they are facing a removal order, but Jose’s family has been kept in the dark about his whereabouts and his destination at every stage of this process.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9119796a646acc4802935fec5fc3c244a9fdff2/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34699fb0f80b9f6c3dce081872f2f9fe",N,,2025-11-14 23:56:42.095856

A leading immigration expert in Washington has termed Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's proposed bill to end H-1B visas as “one of the most efficient ways to hurt Americans,” and would lead to more ""preventable deaths.""

In an interview with IANS, Sarah Pierce, the Director of Social Policy at Third Way, a think tank, argued that Greene's attempt to target the visa programme would “gut access to care overnight.”

“Slashing the flow of foreign workers, including the medical professionals her own communities rely on, would gut access to care overnight.”

On Friday, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X, reiterating her plans to introduce a bill to “ban H1B visas in all sectors” except the medical profession.

In a video post on Thursday, Greene announced her bill proposals - allowing only 10,000 visas annually, down from the current 85,000 cap.

She said even that carve-out could be phased out over the next decade. Her bill would also take away from the citizenship path, forcing visa holders to return home.

Pierce stressed that her exemption proposal of 10,000 visas for medical professionals would still lead to more “preventable deaths.”

“The H-1B programme currently brings in far more medical professionals than her arbitrary 10,000-visa cap allows. This bill would leave US families, especially in rural areas, with fewer doctors, longer wait times, and more preventable deaths. It's cruelty disguised as policy,” she added.

Pierce acknowledged that there are some US workers in tech sectors who have lost jobs due to the H-1B visas, but gutting the entire programme is “both dishonest and dangerous.”

“Eliminating it or drowning it in punitive fees would kneecap the American economy and jeopardise the sectors we rely on most.”

Leading Republican and conservative leaders have demanded the gutting of the H-1B visas after US President Donald Trump defended the foreign worker visa programme.

In an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, Trump was asked if his administration planned to deprioritise H-1B visas. He replied, “You do have to bring in talent.”

When Ingraham countered, “We have plenty of talent,” Trump responded, “No you don't.”

“You don't have certain talents….And people have to learn, you can't take people off an unemployment line and say, I'm going to put you into a factory. We're going to make missiles,” he added.

Laura Ingraham, posted on X on Friday, responding to a CNN debate over the issue.

“America's survival depends on its importing an endless stream of foreign workers—supposedly all geniuses?” she asked.

The White House clarified on Wednesday that it's committed to cracking down on alleged abuses in the visa system, not scrapping the entire programme.

Trump signed a proclamation in September by announcing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications.

Last week, the US Department of Labor (DOL) also launched at least 175 investigations into potential abuses within the H-1B visa programme.

Pierce emphasised that instead of “scapegoating” the programme, US Congress should take the lead in reforming it.

“Congress should do the hard work: reform the programme so it actually delivers for American workers and families. Because the truth is simple—we need more doctors, more home-care workers, and, yes, more high-skilled tech talent if we want this country to function,"" she said.

The administration's H-1B visa policy has already faced legal challenges with two major lawsuits filed in courts, including the one by the US Chamber of Commerce, the country's biggest business organisation.

Pierce said she would be “very surprised” if those cases are not successful, but highlighted the plight of applicants who are currently facing visa hurdles.

“I will be very surprised if the legal challenges aren't successful. Unfortunately, even if they are, that doesn't help applicants who are currently applying and being forced to pay the absurdly high fee,” she noted.

While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology.
In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll body cameras out to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers.
In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say.
She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training.","Immigration Customs and Enforcement has yet to purchase new translation technology it promised nearly four months ago would replace a Spanish language course requirement for officers as part of an effort to speed up the agency’s hiring process, according to two Homeland Security Department officials.

In August, ICE officials told reporters that the agency had purchased new “robust translation services” for officers to use in the field while pursuing immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump’s deportations policy. Caleb Vitello, who was the head of training for new ICE recruits at the time, described the new technology as “so much more efficient” than the five-week-long Spanish course.

ICE had considered providing officers with body-worn translation services, powered by AI, that can be used on body cameras but has not purchased any, the two DHS official said.

The lack of Spanish classes or the body-worn translation devices for new ICE officers as they carry out arrests has sparked concern about potential communication misunderstandings that could endanger the agents and people in the communities they are targeting, the officials said.

The Trump administration has sought to speed up ICE’s hiring process to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new officers by the end of the year.

An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that ICE has replaced the five-week Spanish course that was until July required for new officers with “a more robust translation service,” but declined to say what type of translation services the agency provides.

The agency has relied on a translation service hotline that officers can call when processing immigrants in an office setting, which it continues to use, the DHS officials said.

“Language classes, which previously covered only a specific dialect of Spanish, have been replaced with robust translation and interpretation services that apply to multiple languages,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “ICE frequently encounters native speakers of a diverse range of languages, so modern technology-based solutions are more efficient resources in the field.”

The U.S. Border Patrol still mandates Spanish training for new agents, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

The body-worn translation technology combines body cameras many officers already wear on their vests with AI-translation tools and can detect up to 50 languages. To use it, an officer pushes a button on the body camera and directs it to translate whatever language is being spoken. An AI-generated voice then repeats the words in English.

While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology.

The police department in Joliet, Ill, a city of 150,000 located about an hour outside of Chicago, in June began using the devices, which are developed by Axon Enterprise.

Officials at the department told NBC News that its officers have used the device in more than 1,800 encounters involving 23 different languages.

Officer Charles Moore said having them has helped build the community’s trust in local law enforcement.

“Seeing people when they know that they’re understood, you see their faces light up,” Moore said in an interview with NBC News.

Multiple confrontations involving federal agents and migrants in major U.S. cities have turned violent in recent months, though it’s unclear whether language problems may have contributed to them.

In one of the latest cases to garner attention, a Mexican man and a deputy marshal were shot after a federal agent opened fire while attempting to arrest the man in downtown Los Angeles earlier this week, prosecutors said. Both are expected to recover.

Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff under the Biden administration, said a lack of basic Spanish language skills for agents risks increasing the chances for dangerous encounters.

“That puts both the migrant at risk and potentially law enforcement as you’re taking away the capability for them to openly communicate with those that they interact with,” Houser said.

With 65 million Latinos in the U.S., it’s increasingly common for police departments to mandate Spanish language training. Most police departments in large cities require it. And in the Texas it’s mandatory for all police officers.

In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll body cameras out to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers. The Trump administration has made no publicized efforts to spread beyond that initial 1,600.

In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say.

In August, Raquel Sanchez and her husband were driving to work in Washington, D.C., when they say they were stopped by seven unmarked ICE vehicles. An agent at her car door yelled, “What’s your status in the United States?”

In the recording of the encounter, she and her husband struggled to respond because they don’t speak English, and the agents didn’t know Spanish. “I would ask them if we could talk in Spanish, but they kept talking in English,” she said in a phone interview with NBC News.

Sanchez said she and her husband were handcuffed and driven an hour away to an ICE processing facility. She said she told the officers they had teenage boys at home, and her lawyer successfully pushed for her to be released with an ankle monitor. Her husband was moved to an ICE detention center a few hours away, according to Sanchez and her lawyer.

In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, “ICE makes arrests based on probable cause, and if officers know you are the target, they will make the arrest. If the subject is unknown, there are a number of ways to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause.”

“Additionally, ICE makes custody determination after arrest, which may include referring an illegal alien to ATD, depending on specific circumstances, such as medical needs,” the ICE spokesperson said, referring to alternatives to detention such as an ankle monitor.

The police department in Corpus Christi, Tex., where fewer than half of its 260 officers are native Spanish speakers, uses the Axon AI-generated translation devices. Lt. Jose Gonzalez, who oversees professional standards for the department, said as a native Spanish speaker he was skeptical of the new technology. But after seeing how it’s helped officers in the field over the past few months, he’s now a believer.

“It’s very important because if you can’t communicate with someone during a traffic stop, you can’t figure out if there are weapons in the car,” Gonzalez said. Even so, Gonzalez noted that no technology is foolproof. “What if your camera malfunctions?” he said. “You have to have a foundation to still communicate.”

Cristina Lozano Argüelles, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, agrees. She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training.

“Spanish language training for law enforcement isn’t just about learning vocabulary—it’s about building trust,” Argüelles said. “When officers can communicate directly with Spanish-speaking residents, interactions can be calmer, more respectful, and more effective.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-ice-training-gk-a21989.jpg",N,,2025-11-14 23:56:49.656175

The ruling last week from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment.

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to ""great deference"" in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

Hyundai and Kia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Plaintiff attorney Brian Olney said, “This case is about the dirty secret behind the clean electric vehicles Hyundai is selling to government agencies.
Just work and get it out the door.” Another former Hyundai employee, Rosalinda Soriano-Torres, said the job she was recruited for soon turned into manual labor.
... How can our public agencies purchase vehicles from a company whose supply-chain practices would be illegal here?","A nonprofit organization on Friday sued Orange County-based carmakers Hyundai and Kia, alleging the companies have been violating state law against unfair competition with the use of exploited labor from children, immigrants and inmates.

Jobs to Move America filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court accusing Fountain Valley-based Hyundai and Irvine-based Kia of using cheap labor in supply chains, then masking the practice to obtain contracts from public agencies in California.

State Sen. Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) and Los Angeles City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez warned Friday at a news conference with plaintiffs that the companies’ contracts could face trouble with public agencies if the allegations are proven.

Hyundai and Kia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Meredith Stewart, a litigation director with Alabama-based Jobs to Move America, said the automakers have “engaged in severe labor exploitation, including coerced prison labor, child labor and migrant labor with working conditions that led to higher safety issues and death.”

Stewart said the companies have used labor from prisons in Alabama and Georgia, which she argued “likely violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.”

She further alleged some of the employees are “as young as 13,” claiming both companies “maintain close control over their suppliers and do have the power to influence their employment practices.”

The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing the auto manufacturers from receiving certifications their vehicles are made with high-road employment standards until they submit to an independent audit of their supply chain in Alabama and Georgia, according to Stewart.

Plaintiff attorney Brian Olney said, “This case is about the dirty secret behind the clean electric vehicles Hyundai is selling to government agencies. ... Hyundai uses children to build its vehicles, who aren’t even old enough to drive a car themselves ... Hyundai relies on prison labor, forced labor and even human trafficking.”

Former Hyundai employee Mark Miller said at the news conference he helped make parts for the car company in Montgomery, Ala., and alleged, “There was nothing safe. There was no training. It was ‘get on the line, get the parts and get them out the door no matter what.’”

Whether an employee was sick or injured didn’t matter, Miller said, adding, “I got hurt a couple of times. They’ve got something going with the state. I don’t know what it is, but nobody was ever treated right. Mostly the inmates.

“I mean, there was 33 of us. I worked at the plant for 14 months.... There was no training, no nothing. They told us [to] get on the line, figure it out and get them consoles out the door. It was one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had in my life. There is no safety at Hyundai, there’s no training. There’s no nothing. Just work and get it out the door.”

Another former Hyundai employee, Rosalinda Soriano-Torres, said the job she was recruited for soon turned into manual labor.

“The work was exhausting and the personal protective equipment was minimal ... and the working conditions were dangerous,” she said, adding that immigrants were paid less than U.S. citizens for the same job. “I wanted to quit, but if I lost my job I’d lose my visa.”

When Soriano-Torres got pregnant and asked for a less risky job she was fired, she alleged.

“If these allegations are true we have a serious problem,” Durazo said. “I have questions that need answers. ... How can our public agencies purchase vehicles from a company whose supply-chain practices would be illegal here? And what message does it send if we continue business as usual? The state of California needs to investigate.”

CHICAGO — Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino is no longer in Chicago, according to reports.

Bovino, a controversial leader of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Chicago, left the city Thursday for Charlotte, North Carolina, CBS News reported Friday, citing unnamed sources.

Appearing on Fox News midday Thursday, Bovino said he was in West Virginia, training with hundreds of Border Patrol agents in preparation for a possible return to Chicago and other cities.

“And you’re going to see us redeploy — it could be New York, it could be Chicago, it could be in Charlotte — but one thing that’s gonna happen is, Gov. Pritzker is gonna see a lot more immigration enforcement. … You can guarantee it,” Bovino said.

Questions Block Club sent Friday to Department of Homeland Security officials about the decision to relocate Bovino — including who would replace him, if social media influencers embedded with his team would be traveling with him and whether lawsuits filed in federal court over federal immigration agents’ use of force impacted the decision — went unanswered.

“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, said in an email.

McLaughlin denied in a social media post Tuesday that Bovino was leaving Chicago in response to reports earlier this week about the Border Patrol chief’s possible exit.

But officials from Mecklenburg County in North Carolina confirmed they’ve been informed that Border Patrol personnel are arriving in the Charlotte area, according to a news release.

Citing a Homeland Security official, the Sun-Times previously reported 1,000 federal agents could return to Chicago in March. About 200 Border Patrol agents had been conducting operations in the Chicago area recently, a top federal immigration enforcement official previously said.

Bovino announced the launch of Operation At Large in September, a week after the start of Operation Midway Blitz, a separate immigration enforcement effort led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Both are presumably focused on arresting undocumented immigrants with serious criminal histories.

But in the months since, federal agents have shot at least two people, killing one; repeatedly tear-gassed protesters and first responders; shot rubber bullets at protesters; detained U.S. citizens, including children; handcuffed a Chicago alderperson in a hospital; smoke bombed and tear-gassed a Chicago street; fired a chemical weapon at a TV reporter and detained a journalist, among other incidents.

Bovino has been a visible figure since arriving in Chicago, posing for photo ops aboard a boat on the Chicago River and Downtown — most recently at the Bean in Millennium Park early Monday.

Bovino has also been an active participant in immigration raids across the city, seen on video tear-gassing crowds of residents in Little Village, among other incidents, and he is at the center of a federal lawsuit challenging agents’ use of force throughout the immigration crackdown.

Last week, federal Judge Sara L. Ellis blasted Bovino, saying he admitted in a deposition that he lied when claiming he was hit by a rock before tear-gassing people in Little Village.

At the same hearing, Ellis extended restrictions she put on federal immigration agents’ use of force and crowd control tactics. This week, the Trump administration filed an emergency appeal to the block the order, calling it “unworkable.”

And U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings plans to release on bond hundreds of people who have been detained by federal immigration agents in Chicago since June, which Bovino criticized during his appearance on Fox News Thursday.

“Whether they were criminals or individuals that were taking jobs from Americans — you name it, that’s what they were doing. And I’ll tell you what’s gonna happen,” Bovino said. “We’re gonna go even harder on the streets. If he releases those 650, we’re gonna apprehend 1,650 on the streets of Chicago.”

21 People Arrested Outside Broadview ICE Facility

A total of 21 people were arrested outside the ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview Friday “in connection with protests in Broadview around the facility being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” according to a release from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

The arrests happened around 10 a.m. Friday, according to the release.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson criticized “out-of-town protesters” for causing injury to two of her suburb’s police officers as well as officers for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office and Illinois State Police, in a Friday statement.

“I have repeatedly pleaded to protesters to raise their voices, not their fists. They have chosen their fists,” Thompson said in her statement accusing demonstrators of violence.

The two Broadview officers and the Cook County police officers were taken to Loyola Hospital for treatment, Thompson said in the statement.

In early October, local and state police set up designated protest zones with barricades to keep protesters away from the ICE facility. The Cook County Sheriff’s Office also began sending out news releases about people arrested near the facility.

The 9 a.m. demonstration at the ICE facility started peacefully with people chanting and singing, the Sun-Times reported. Federal agents were not on the scene, and no tear gas, pepper balls or chemical agents were deployed, according to the Sun-Times.

Around 10 a.m. a group of protesters exited the designated protest zones and tried to walk toward the ICE facility, prompting state police to push protesters back, according to WGN.

Over the past several months, similar scenes have played out frequently in Broadview, which has become a flashpoint in Chicago’s resistance to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement crackdown.

After attacking general human rights, Germany's ""he who must not be named"" began a shift to targeting minority rights, using the ideological construction of ""us vs. them"" with ethnic contours. The German state apparatus mobilized for large-scale violence under ideological justification.

In the U.S. today, immigration debates and enforcement often frame undocumented (and sometimes legal) immigrants as a separate category: a threat to public safety, a burden, potentially an ""enemy"" or outsider. For example:Critics of ICE point out that enforcement is increasingly aggressive and publicly politicized.

Public opinion shows ICE's popularity dropping significantly: by mid-2025, ICE's net favorability was negative, with a substantial share of Americans supporting its abolition.

The rhetoric of ""invasion,"" ""illegal aliens"" and ""dangerous criminals"" used by some officials creates an ""us vs. them"" tone.

This is not to suggest that at present the U.S. context mirrors the genocidal intent, breadth of violence or totalitarian state of the German 1930s and 1940s. The comparison is about mindset and mechanisms, not scale or moral equivalence.

One can observe certain parallels, with important caveats, in today's U.S. political climate around immigration enforcement and ICE. Germany's regime mobilized security units, eliminated resistance and institutionalized repression. Today, with legal U.S. citizens being detained, ICE has increased its enforcement reach, use of force and opaque operations. Plans for giant ""detention building facilities"" are being finalized.

Local law enforcement cooperation programs, such as here in Hamilton County, allow broader identification and immigrant arrests through local institutions. This trend of escalating state enforcement, blurring lines between civil and criminal law, increases pressure on immigrant communities.

Immigrant communities report heightened fear, reduced school attendance and community disruption due to raids and enforcement actions.

The U.S. system still has significant legal checks, constitutional protections, public accountability and open democratic debate — unlike the historic German regime which dismantled dissent and legal safeguards wholesale.

It is important to remember normalcy can shift; what once seemed extreme becomes everyday. The German regime gradually made mass violence computational and bureaucratized it.

In the U.S. today, the massive expansion of ICE's budget, increased resources for enforcement and recruitment drives for ICE agents suggests normalization of large-scale interior enforcement. Some tactics formerly considered extraordinary, such as unmarked vans and courthouse arrests, are now common daily.

The public's tolerance, or acquiescence, to large enforcement actions may shift over time.

The warning here is about how states may gradually scale enforcement and shift norms, making more extreme actions seem acceptable.

For those concerned about civil liberties, immigrant rights or democratic norms, these analogies offer a lens for vigilance — how easily rights erode when a state defines ""outsiders,"" grants extraordinary powers to enforcement agencies and suppresses or criminalizes dissent and resistance.

For policymakers and the public, the implication is to ask: Are enforcement powers proportionate? Are oversight, accountability and legal safeguards maintained? Is the framing of immigrants as the ""enemy within"" being used to justify broad powers? What do you think?

The two Oregon nonprofits that sued federal immigration agencies last month have added another plaintiff to their suit and are asking the court to stop federal agencies from blocking all people detained in Oregon from access to their lawyers.

The Clear Clinic, a Portland-based legal nonprofit, and Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, Oregon’s largest Latino labor union, sued the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the ICE field office in Seattle, as well as the leaders of each agency, in October alleging they are purposefully denying people in detention centers access to their lawyers before transferring them from Oregon to facilities in Washington, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

The groups argue that under the U.S. Constitution, all detained people regardless of their immigration status have the right to speak with a lawyer before getting transferred.

The groups amended their complaint on Wednesday, adding plaintiff Leon X, a 32-year-old resident of Oregon who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 6 years old. He grew up in Oregon’s farmworker community, and he is using a pseudonym in court documents to protect the details of his own immigration case, according to the filing.

The plaintiffs’ lawyers argue Leon X represents a class of people who have been detained by ICE or are at risk of arrest for alleged civil immigration violations in the District of Oregon. He and the other plaintiffs are asking the court to stop federal immigration authorities from blocking him, and others who might be detained by ICE, from meeting with an attorney.

Innovation Law Lab Director of Legal Advocacy Tess Hellgren said plaintiffs are asking the court to require that federal immigration authorities give detainees access to their lawyers before they are transferred out of the District of Oregon. Innovation Law Lab is a nonprofit law firm representing the plaintiffs.

“Meaningful access to counsel requires notice, time and space to actually consult with attorneys,” Hellgren said.

Immigration authorities detained more than 300 people in Oregon in October, and there have been at least 150 detentions in November so far, according to Innovation Law Lab.

Attorneys at Innovation Law Lab have filed 13 habeas corpus petitions since June. These are court orders forcing law enforcement authorities to justify a person’s continued detention. Many of those detained have been freed from ICE detention under these petitions, including people who were detained outside their immigration hearings, a wildland firefighter who was detained while working at a remote and active fire and a wreath maker detained on her way to work, according to Innovation Law Lab.

“When they’re repeatedly told that judges who rule against a president — they are corrupt and they should be impeached.
The Trump administration has said federal authorities conducted a probe but that there was no “credible evidence” of criminal wrongdoing.
Judges that want to inject their own personal agenda into the law have no place on the bench,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
“[Trump]’s got the bully pulpit and he’s got social media.","In a year full of judicial rebukes for the president — often followed by vindication for Trump at the Supreme Court — these judges’ fierce and direct assessments of the president have stood out. But there’s more than lofty rhetoric that binds them. All were appointed to the bench decades ago by the same president: Ronald Reagan.

Now a fourth member of the Reagan-era fraternity has joined them: U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf, who took the bench in Massachusetts 40 years ago on the same day as Young. Wolf resigned his senior judgeship last week with the sole purpose of speaking out against what he sees as Trump’s incursion on the rule of law and the high court’s acquiescence to it.

It’s not an accident. Not only do these Reagan-appointed judges wield their seniority as a weapon, but their legal and judicial careers were all forged in the embers of Watergate, when a president’s assertion of vast, unprecedented power threatened to topple the justice system. They all worked and clerked for attorneys and judges tasked with rebuilding confidence in the federal government after Richard Nixon’s resignation and saw in it a vindication of principled appeals to impartial justice.

In a wide-ranging interview with POLITICO, Wolf said his own upbringing as a public corruption prosecutor during that moment of rebuilding is what has contributed to his alarm today. He sees echoes of that era in Trump’s second term but is worried that Americans — who would not have tolerated such behavior in the Watergate era, he says — may be too conditioned to view the world through partisan lenses to respond similarly today.

“I don’t know where the American people are today,” Wolf lamented. “When they’re repeatedly told that judges who rule against a president — they are corrupt and they should be impeached. I’m afraid if the courts do not have the support they need … our rule of law and our democracy will be doomed.”

Wolf cited the case of Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, and reports that he accepted $50,000 in cash from an undercover FBI agent as part of a potential payoff for his work in a future Trump administration. The Trump administration has said federal authorities conducted a probe but that there was no “credible evidence” of criminal wrongdoing. Homan has denied that he took the money.

Wolf said now that the case is closed, he’s surprised there isn’t a louder public outcry — including from Republicans — to see the evidence.

“If there’s uninvestigated possible criminal activity by Mr. Homan, I think that should be a matter of significant public concern. And if the tape recordings and other evidence indicate that he did not engage in any illegal conduct, I think he deserves to be exonerated in the court of public opinion,” Wolf said. “I don’t know why Republicans in Congress, as well as Democrats, don’t ask for that.”

A White House spokesperson called the judge’s comments about Homan “hyper-partisan,” saying they “only further affirm Wolf’s decision to step down.”

“The blatantly political investigation into Tom found absolutely no evidence of illegal activity. Judges that want to inject their own personal agenda into the law have no place on the bench,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

Wolf’s decision to speak out is also born of frustration with the Supreme Court’s overwhelming willingness to side with Trump despite the routine drubbings the president has taken in the lower courts.

“When Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa all started hitting 60 home runs or more when no one in the history of baseball except Babe Ruth and Roger Maris had ever hit 60 home runs, there was reason to suspect something improper was going on,” Wolf said. “When the president wins 17 out of 20 cases decided on the shadow docket, to me at least it raises a concern about whether there’s a possible lack of impartiality.”

Jackson said “the Trump Administration’s policies have been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as lawful despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful lower court rulings.”

Wolf noted that Lamberth, Young and Coughenour’s comments about Trump all came in their written opinions or courtroom statements, the limited forums that judges have to give voice to their concerns.

“My concern is that gets drowned out,” he said, suggesting that’s in part why he chose to step away from the bench to make his case publicly. “[Trump]’s got the bully pulpit and he’s got social media. The best response to bad speech is better speech.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F3d%2F65%2Fc5f069ba48c7bbf5bb0fedce9683%2Ftrump-government-shutdown-13957.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 18:58:21.713669

But the American public isn’t done with it yet: Getting everything back up and running doesn’t happen all at once.

The disruption of the closure, clocking in at 43 days, varied in its impact. Some people, like unpaid federal workers, were immediately and directly affected. Others included recipients of federal funding through programs like Head Start and food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

As the shutdown progressed, effects rippled. Delays and flight cancellations started racking up for passengers as the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut back on flights because of air traffic controller shortages. There were closures at Smithsonian museum sites and the National Zoo (although the animals still got fed).

That’s a lot of programs, agencies and systems. Reclaiming “normal” won’t be instantaneous. Here’s a guide to what reopening looks like:

Federal workers

WHAT HAPPENED: About 1.25 million federal workers haven’t been paid since Oct. 1, missing about $16 billion in wages, according to official estimates. The workers were either furloughed or worked without pay in agencies across the federal government. Many struggled to make ends meet during that time, and the regional economy around Washington, D.C., took a hit.

WHAT NOW: The Office of Personnel Management, which manages the civil service, posted on X that federal workers were expected to be back Thursday, saying that “employees are expected to begin the workday on time. Normal operating procedures are in effect.” The pay owed to the workers will come in by Nov. 19. The money will go out in four separate tranches, depending on the agency, according to a senior administration official.

Help with heat

WHAT HAPPENED: The shutdown coincided with the arrival of colder temperatures, and funding for the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program was halted, prompting some states to delay payments for heating bills.

WHAT NOW: A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said Thursday that an agency within HHS will “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” but no timeline was given. Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said it could take until mid-December or longer. Wolfe said recipients should still submit applications and tell utility companies they’re waiting for the funds. It’s trickier for people who rely on oil and propane because typically there are no protections. Recipients should check with their state; Vermont backfilled funding and Connecticut has pledged to cover the cost.

Flight disruptions

WHAT HAPPENED: The shutdown caused significant disruptions in aviation, with more and more unpaid air traffic controllers missing work as they dealt with the financial pressures and some of them picked up side jobs. Those staff shortages, combined with some troubling safety data, prompted the government to order airlines to cut some of their flights over the past week to relieve pressure on the system.

WHAT NOW: Those cuts aren’t increasing right now, but the Federal Aviation Administration won’t lift the order until safety metrics improve. Airlines say they expect to resume normal operations quickly after that. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said that controllers and other FAA employees should receive 70% of their back pay within 24-48 hours of the end of the shutdown, with the rest to come.

Federal social programs: SNAP

WHAT HAPPENED: Among the most high-profile impacts of the shutdown was on the SNAP program, which serves around 42 million people — about 1 in 8 Americans — in lower-income households. A series of court rulings and shifting policies from the Trump administration led to a patchwork distribution of November benefits. While some states had already issued full benefits, about two-thirds of states had issued only partial benefits or none at all.

WHAT NOW: On Thursday, state officials said they were working quickly to get full benefits to the millions of people who missed their regular monthly payments. Some states said SNAP recipients should receive their full monthly benefits starting Thursday or Friday, though it could take up to a week.

Federal social programs: Head Start

WHAT HAPPENED: When it comes to Head Start, the shutdown had held up the distribution of federal grant payments. Some affected centers remained open by furloughing portions of their staff or tapping into emergency reserves. Others were forced to close, shutting down child care for thousands of families. Head Start serves children from birth to age 5 who come from families that qualify for federal low-income guidelines, are homeless or receive public assistance. The program provides preschool education as well as developmental screenings and free meals.

WHAT NOW: The Office of Head Start will expedite funding and directly contact the impacted programs to share a timeline of when they can expect federal money, said Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The office is already operating at a reduced capacity after experiencing substantial layoffs earlier this year. But even when programs receive their money, program leaders worry of staffing shortages if too many furloughed employees already found other jobs. Some advocates said it could take several weeks for some of the programs across the country to receive funding and restore operations.

Taxes

WHAT HAPPENED: The Internal Revenue Service had closed walk-in assistance centers.

WHAT NOW: The centers are being reopened. The agency said all tax deadlines remain in effect but a backlog of paper correspondence developed during the shutdown, so responses will be delayed. Social Security recipients continued receiving payments throughout the shutdown. Local offices also remained open, though they had temporarily suspended a few services, including replacing Medicare cards and updating earnings records.

Education

WHAT HAPPENED: The Education Department laid off 466 Education Department staffers in the cross-government firings meant to pressure Democratic lawmakers over the shutdown. Those layoffs had been halted by a federal judge. The department furloughed 2,117 employees at the start of the shutdown, but some were brought back for essential work. New grants were also put on hold during the shutdown. Most school districts received the bulk of their federal funding over the summer, but some grants have been delayed.

WHAT NOW: The department said Thursday it had brought back all furloughed staff members or those dismissed in the Trump administration’s mass firings. Recipients of Impact Aid, which boosts the budgets of districts with large amounts of federal land that can’t be taxed for local schools, were waiting to learn when their payments would be processed.

The military

WHAT HAPPENED: Members of the U.S. military dealt with weeks of anxiety over whether they would get paid as they continued working. The Trump administration ultimately found ways to pay troops for the two pay periods during the closure. But the process was fraught; the administration located the money just days before each paycheck. Pay arrived days later than usual for many service members with early direct deposit, disrupting their ability to pay bills and forcing some to pay late fees or rack up debt. Reimbursements for the cost of moving between bases, which affects roughly 400,000 military families each year, were paused during the shutdown, advocates said. And weekend drills for many reservists were canceled, eliminating a chunk of pay that can be several hundred dollars each month.

WHAT NOW: Civilians in the Defense Department began returning Thursday. According to a memo provided to The Associated Press, the Air Force said civilians could take a day of administrative leave or work remotely for up to a week. Several military officials said the impacts on active-duty troops have been minimal.

National parks

WHAT HAPPENED: The country’s national parks largely stayed open through the shutdown with limited staffing. Outside groups and state governments had picked up the tab during the shutdown to keep visitor centers running and help with trash cleanup at many parks. And the Trump administration tapped into previously collected entrance fees to pay for cleaning restrooms and other basic services. But the efforts didn’t stop vandals from defacing rock features along Devils Garden Trail in Arches National Park in Utah and toppling a stone wall at Devil’s Den in Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania.

WHAT NOW: National Park Service employees were ordered back to work Thursday. It will take time for rangers to fully assess parks, including backcountry areas, and more damage could yet be discovered, said Kristen Brengel with the National Parks Conservation Association. No fees were collected during the shutdown, costing parks almost $1 million a day in lost revenue.

Museums

WHAT HAPPENED: The Smithsonian buildings and the National Zoo were first closed Oct. 12. They are typically open every day except Christmas. The 20 sites together hosted more than 16 million people last year, and the organization has more than 3,600 federal employees. While the zoo has been closed, the popular livestream feeds capturing the famous giant pandas were offline. The normally active social media pages sharing animal updates and colorful photographs were silent. The animals continue to be fed and get care.

WHAT NOW: Two of the Smithsonian’s museums along the National Mall – American History and Air and Space – were to reopen Friday. The organization says on its website that the rest of the Smithsonian’s sites across the Washington area and New York will reopen by Monday on a rolling basis.

This meeting comes as the human rights conditions in both Saudi Arabia and the United States continue to worsen. This will be the Crown Prince’s first official visit to the U.S. since March 2018 and since the state-sanctioned murder of Saudi journalist and U.S. permanent resident Jamal Khashoggi, for which there has still been no justice.

“In Saudi Arabia, human rights conditions have significantly deteriorated under the Crown Prince’s leadership,” said Elizabeth Rghebi, MENA Advocacy Director with Amnesty International USA. “Amnesty International has documented how Saudi authorities have intensified their crackdown on freedom of expression over the past few years, with Saudi courts convicting and handing down lengthy prison terms to dozens of individuals for expressing themselves on social media. This attack on the freedom of expression must end.”

Those who have been targeted include Manahel al-Otabi, a Saudi fitness influencer and women’s human rights defender, serving a five-year prison sentence solely for her social media posts. Abdulrahman al-Sadhan was sentenced to 20 years in prison for satirical tweets. Sheikh Salman Alodah has been unjustly detained and held in solitary confinement for seven years due to his social media posts. Mohammed al-Ghamdi is now serving 30 years in prison for tweets critical of the authorities. Members of Congress should use this visit as an opportunity to call for their immediate and unconditional release. Executions opens in a new tab have also reached record levels for a wide range of offenses, a significant percentage related to drugs.

Freedom of expression has also been under attack in the U.S.

“During his first year back in office President Trump has taken a sledgehammer to the rights to freedom of expression and assembly, especially targeting those who voice dissenting opinions,” said Rghebi. “Students criticizing Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip have been particularly targeted and face surveillance, arbitrary and otherwise unlawful protest related arrests, enforced disappearances, and deportation orders. The Trump administration must end its targeting of people simply for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly.”

Leqaa Kordia is the latest protester still languishing in U.S. immigration detention after being targeted for her protest activity against Israel’s genocide. Amnesty International is advocating for her release.

At the same time, Israel, armed by the U.S., is continuing its genocide against Palestinians in Gaza amid a so-called ceasefire agreement.

“President Trump and the Crown Prince must do more to ensure a full cessation of hostilities and a total lifting of Israel’s unlawful blockade to allow the unhindered flow of life saving supplies to all parts of Gaza,” said Rghebi. “The U.S. must also immediately suspend the sale and transfer of all arms to Israel or risk complicity.”

“This united front is what you get when you mess with our kids.” Why is Attorney General Todd Rokita suing IPS?
The attorney general previously disagreed with IPS’ retelling of events, saying in a social media post his office granted multiple extensions after the delivery of its initial letter.
“Tell your attorney general to stand down,” said David Greene Sr., president of the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis.","Black faith leaders came together Thursday, Nov. 13, to send a message to Attorney General Todd Rokita: “Keep your hands off our kids.”

The message comes as a response to the attorney general’s recent action suing IPS for the district’s failure nearly a year ago to release a student to immigration officials.

The faith leaders made clear their support for IPS. They called the lawsuit political theater and questioned the attorney general’s use of tax dollars in pursuing the case.

Josh Riddick with the Black Church Coalition helped organize the group standing with IPS. He’s also the father of an IPS student and spoke about his fears as a parent.

“I dread a future where I have to calm my child down and try to make sense of why their friends were taken by masked men and disappeared,” Riddick said. “Instead, I want a future where every child can thrive in our schools, every child gets the resources they need to be successful, and their hunger to learn can be fed by a school who is not distracted by frivolous, partisan lawsuits.”

Faith leaders said the gathering, which included representatives from the Baptist Ministers Alliance, Capitol City Baptist Fellowship, Concerned Clergy, and Statewide Missionary Baptists, was necessary to show a united front.

Five IPS commissioners and several top administrators, including Superintendent Aleesia Johnson, also attended and joined the faith leaders in prayer.

The lawsuit comes alongside growing fears among educators nationally that their schools could become caught in the crosshairs of hostility toward immigrants and the Trump administration’s mass deportation strategy.

Darrell Brooks, pastor at New Liberty Missionary Baptist Church on the far east side, said it was important for all schools in Indianapolis to stand together.

“If we do not hold the line here, IPS will not be the last district that is under attack,” he said. “This united front is what you get when you mess with our kids.”

Why is Attorney General Todd Rokita suing IPS?

The lawsuit takes issue with a nearly nine-year-old IPS directive to employees not to assist immigration officials unless legally required to do so. It references an event that happened nearly a year ago.

Rokita wrote in recent legal filings, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers contacted IPS in January to seek a student’s dismissal from school after their parent voluntarily agreed to return to his home country.

After IPS refused to release the student without being presented a court order, the attorney general said, the parent missed a planned flight out of the country. In February, Rokita sent a letter to IPS, outlining concerns about district directives.

IPS officials said in a recent statement they had been collaborating with the attorney general’s office to review relevant district policies, but the state official provided little time to respond to his office’s findings.

The attorney general previously disagreed with IPS’ retelling of events, saying in a social media post his office granted multiple extensions after the delivery of its initial letter.

The lawsuit does not name the parent nor the student, and IPS has not filed a legal response yet. But, during a recent community meeting, IPS Board President Angelia Moore alluded to safety concerns related to releasing a student to an unknown person.

“You cannot walk into a school without identification and take a child,” Moore said during the meeting. “So, until we can address the bigger issue of keeping our children safe, we will continue to fight this.”

In a statement to Mirror Indy after the Black Church Coalition’s press conference, a spokesperson for Rokita shifted blame onto educators and accused the district of keeping migrant students in classrooms for financial gain.

“This action is about upholding the rule of law,” the statement read, in part. “There are 400,000 unaccompanied migrant kids in the country, and there’s almost certainly some of them in our IPS schoolrooms.”

Public schools across the U.S. are legally required to educate students, regardless of immigration status. Plyler v. Doe, a landmark Supreme Court case from the 1980s, found it unconstitutional to deny an immigrant student access to a free, public K-12 education.

‘A safe and welcoming place to learn’

In addition to pushing back against Rokita’s actions, faith leaders issued an appeal directly to Gov. Mike Braun.

“Tell your attorney general to stand down,” said David Greene Sr., president of the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis. “Tell him to stop using our children’s classroom as political theater.”

IPS Commissioner Ashley Thomas launched a Change.org petition seeking support for the district and its students.

It had more than 1,200 signatures at the time of the Black Church Coalition’s gathering.

Jerry Davis III, representing Crossroads AME Church on the north side, said as pastors, the faith leaders understand something policymakers sometimes forget: “When you disrupt a school, you destabilize a community.”

“We cannot and will not be silent about that,” he said. “Every child, every race, every culture, every immigration status deserves a safe and welcoming place to learn.”

Boston University did not immediately respond to messages on Friday.","The president of the Boston University College Republicans has been attacked online for saying on social media that he had called immigration agents before a raid at a Boston carwash in which nine workers were detained.

Zac Segal, a Boston University junior and a track athlete, according to his school bio page, posted on social media on Nov. 7 that he had “been calling ICE for months” about workers at Allston Car Wash, near the Boston University campus in the Allston neighborhood. Federal agents swarmed the business on Nov. 4, detaining five women and four men who worked there, according to their lawyer, Todd Pomerleau. The workers are contesting their detentions in court, he said.

Mr. Segal’s post about the carwash included a link to an article about the raid. He wrote that immigration agents “finally responded to my request to detain these criminals. As someone who lives in the neighborhood, I’ve seen how American jobs are being given away to those with no right to be here. Pump up the numbers!”

Hundreds of people have attacked Mr. Segal online for his post. On the Instagram page of the B.U. College Republicans, one person wrote that “Zac Segal should be deported!” Another suggested more ominously, “Zac Segal should be afraid.” Mr. Segal also received messages of support on the social media platform X, such as “Patriot!” and “Thank you Zac.”

Mr. Segal did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. On Thursday, he reposted, without comment, messages calling him “racist and fascist” and labeling him a “neo-nazi.”

He also posted a screenshot of a Boston Globe article about his efforts to report the carwash workers to ICE, writing, “We must stand up for this country.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains a tip line and encourages citizens to report “suspicious activity” by phone or online.

The College Republicans of America, the national group with which B.U. College Republicans is affiliated, defended Mr. Segal for doing what the government had asked of him. “We call on all College Republicans to follow in the lead of this great patriot and notify their local ICE forces of any suspected illegal activity in their communities immediately,” Martin Bertao, the national group’s president, said in a statement.

The B.U. Republicans announced its affiliation with the College Republicans of America this week, after it broke away from another group, the College Republican National Committee, over concerns about its direction and allegations of misconduct.

It is not clear that Mr. Segal actually had anything to do with causing the Nov. 4 immigration raid in Allston. The Trump administration on Friday denied that Mr. Segal had brought agents to the carwash.

“The operation was highly targeted and relied on law enforcement intelligence — not your silly rumor,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, wrote in an email.

Mr. Segal’s school bio says he is an economics major from London.

The attorney for the workers, Mr. Pomerleau, said they had been busy vacuuming cars when “military style” vehicles pulled up to the carwash. Masked agents who he said were clearly armed began making arrests. Those detained included a brother and sister and a pair of sisters. Another person is 67 and has lived in the United States for some 30 years, Mr. Pomerleau said.

In referring to the detained workers as “criminals” in his post, Mr. Segal “is spreading false information about nine people he doesn’t know,” Mr. Pomerleau said. “These people are not criminals.”

He expects bond hearings to begin soon. “All of them at a minimum are going to get due process under the law.”

Mr. Pomerleau said he has received an outpouring of support for the detained workers.

“Now they’re trying to reach inside the United States and overturn the settled expectations of people who have already been here,” he said.
“Something that makes this more legally vulnerable,” Ms. Pierce said, “is the fact that it applies to individuals who are inside the United States.”","The Trump administration is planning a policy change that could make it harder for immigrants to get green cards and other approvals if they are from countries subject to the president’s travel ban, according to internal documents from the Department of Homeland Security.

As part of the expected change, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would consider what it called “country-specific factors” included in President Trump’s travel ban as “significant negative factors” when reviewing applications for many immigration requests, with certain exceptions, according to draft documents reviewed by The New York Times. The policy is still being finalized.

The policy change is a major expansion of the administration’s push to crack down on immigration from countries that it says lack sufficient screening and vetting for official documents. The shift would make it more challenging for those who arrived in the country before the travel ban to remain.

The change is also the latest effort by the Trump administration to narrow paths for legal immigration. Last month, the administration cut the number of refugees it would admit to the United States this fiscal year, rejecting thousands of people fleeing war and persecution while reserving slots for mostly white Afrikaner South Africans.

The policy change comes after Mr. Trump in June signed a travel ban on 12 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East. The ban bars travel to the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The ban also imposed partial restrictions on citizens from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Citizens of those countries cannot enter the United States permanently or receive certain visas.

Mr. Trump said in June that the ban was necessary because a recent domestic terrorist attack “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted.” He added that people from certain countries were at greater risk of overstaying their visas.

The administration gave some exceptions to the travel ban. People with existing visas would be exempt, as would green card holders, athletes traveling to the United States for the 2026 World Cup or the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and Afghans eligible for the Special Immigrant Visa program, which is for those who helped the U.S. government during the war in Afghanistan.

A spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the agency would not comment on draft internal guidance.

In the draft documents, the agency said some countries might not share enough vetting and screening information. Some countries also do not have adequate authorities for issuing passports and other documents, which affected the agency’s ability to decide whether an immigrant from that country qualified for a benefit, according to the documents.

The change would apply to certain applications for green cards, asylum, parole and other statuses that require a “discretionary analysis,” a review that involves an immigration officer assessing the positive and negative factors of a person’s application before approving it. The change would not apply to applications for citizenship.

Some immigration policy experts said it was unclear exactly how the policy would be carried out, but they were alarmed that certain applications for immigration benefits could be adversely affected because of a person’s country of origin.

“Having something that applies to you based on your country is absurd,” said Doug Rand, a senior official at Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration. “This is a radical change.”

Mr. Rand emphasized that the change would apply to people who had already been screened for national security risks and had legal authorization to live in the United States.

“Now they’re trying to reach inside the United States and overturn the settled expectations of people who have already been here,” he said. “This is an escalation of the Trump administration’s attack on legal immigration.”

Citizenship and Immigration Services has also expanded social media vetting and checks for “anti-American activity” for certain applicants for immigration benefits, including those seeking green cards. The agency said on Thursday that it had completed 12,502 individual social media checks in the 2025 fiscal year.

Michael Valverde, who was a senior official at Citizenship and Immigration Services for more than two decades, said the agency had long had to deal with applications based on documents that were harder to validate because they were issued by countries that lacked robust security practices. But perceiving difficult-to-corroborate documents as a negative factor in applications was new, he said.

“It will be telling if people actually are able to overcome the negative or if this is a de facto ban for people from the listed locations,” Mr. Valverde said.

Some experts said the effort would most likely increase denials of applications for benefits, although they expected it to be met with legal challenges. In the draft, Citizenship and Immigration Services said officials did not know how the policy change would affect denial rates.

Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden and Trump administrations, said she thought that there was “no way that this policy wouldn’t increase denials” and that it would “endanger the idea of a fair and impartial review of those immigration cases.”

Ms. Pierce, who is the director of social policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank, said: “It’s fair and legitimate for the government to consider the validity of an applicant’s security check, whether or not there is sufficient information to determine that this individual is not a safety risk to the United States, and whether or not they trust that information. But the thing that’s illegitimate about this policy is that they’re predetermining that because someone is from a certain country.”

Ms. Pierce said she expected the policy to be legally challenged by people who could argue it was discriminating against them based on their nationality. She also said that Mr. Trump’s ability to impose travel bans relied on his authority to restrict the entry of foreign citizens to the United States.

“Something that makes this more legally vulnerable,” Ms. Pierce said, “is the fact that it applies to individuals who are inside the United States.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/14/multimedia/14dc-travelban-tgcm/14dc-travelban-tgcm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 16:57:11.190133

The Cost of Withdrawal For decades, the US has portrayed itself as a promoter and guardian of human rights norms.
If the US truly wants to lead on human rights, it has to be part of the conversation.","By refusing to undergo the same human rights scrutiny it demands of others, the United States isn't just abandoning accountability—it's dismantling the very system that gives its advocacy credibility, the author argues.

The United States’ decision to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council and, consequently, from this year’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) marks a worrying retreat from global human rights accountability. Although the announcement did not cite any specific reasons for the withdrawal, it reflects a deeper unwillingness to accept scrutiny under the same universal standards that the US expects of others. A pattern particularly evident during the Trump Administration.

The UPR was established in 2006, when the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 60/251, which created the Human Rights Council and tasked it with conducting periodic reviews of all UN Member States. The reform aimed to correct decades of politicization and selectivity within the UN’s human rights system. Some states had escaped scrutiny altogether, while others were targeted disproportionately. The UPR was designed as a structural response to this imbalance.

In 2008, the UPR held its first review sessions, with its defining feature, universality: all 193 UN Member States are reviewed every four to five years, regardless of their geopolitical or treaty status. The process is built on peer review; states evaluate one another’s records through dialogue, not condemnation.

Each review draws on three sources:

1. A national report prepared by the state under review.

2. A UN compilation summarizing information from treaty bodies and special rapporteurs.

3. Submissions from stakeholders, including civil society, national human rights institutions, and independent experts.

The outcome of each review is a set of recommendations that the state may accept or note, followed by implementation reporting in later cycles. In practice, the UPR relies on reputation, transparency, and peer accountability rather than formal enforcement. The process was created to ensure that all states, regardless of their size or political influence, are held to the same human rights standards. That principle of equal treatment is central to the UPR’s legitimacy, and it is precisely what makes US disengagement so damaging. By stepping away, the US signals that it is unwilling to be evaluated under the same conditions it expects of others.

The US Record and the Break With Tradition

The US has participated in three previous UPR cycles: 2010, 2015, and 2020. Each review drew hundreds of recommendations from other states. Many of these suggestions addressed issues such as racial discrimination, criminal justice, immigration detention, and the failure to implement crucial human rights treaties like the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

While this process often causes defensiveness, it also provides moments of introspection. The State Department’s reports have historically acknowledged challenges and outlined reform efforts, creating at least a nexus between international review and domestic reflection.

By declining to participate in the 2025 cycle, the US not only abandons its prior record of engagement but also undermines a system it helped create. This decision is especially concerning given that it coincides with increasing domestic threats to civil rights, immigration policy, and constitutional freedoms.

The Cost of Withdrawal

For decades, the US has portrayed itself as a promoter and guardian of human rights norms. Participation in the UPR has been one of the few processes that allowed it to model transparency rather than merely demand it from others.

When Washington calls out Beijing for repressing Uyghurs or Israel for their actions against Palestinians, the world listens. But when the US refuses to go through the same kind of review and scrutiny, that authority starts to fail. The credibility required of human rights advocacy depends on a variety of factors, including a state’s willingness to hold itself to the same standards it demands from others. By boycotting the review, the US opens itself to accusations of hypocrisy and undermines its position as a moral authority.

The decision to separate from accountability does not occur alone. The UPR’s legitimacy depends on universal participation. Every state that undergoes review reinforces the norm of shared accountability; every withdrawal weakens it. When a leading democracy like the US refuses to appear before the Human Rights Council, other governments, particularly authoritarian ones, gain an easy excuse to follow. The result could erode one of the few UN mechanisms that applies equally to all states and gradually transform it into a voluntary or politically selective process.

As previously mentioned, the UPR has also been a space for accountability at home. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch have used the process to draw attention to issues that often get lost in domestic debate, including racial injustice, Indigenous rights, and conditions in immigration detention. Given the political climate the US is facing, where migrants are frequently disappeared into detention centers without due process and families are separated without explanation, outside scrutiny is not a threat but a safeguard. The UPR gives advocates a platform to connect these realities to the country’s broader human rights commitments. Without it, one of the few avenues for meaningful reflection and reform disappears, leaving both domestic advocates and international partners with fewer ways to hold the US to its own standards.

While many argue that the UPR is inherently flawed due to its politicization and non-binding nature, critics misread its function. Since its creation, the UPR was never meant to be a court or a compliance tribunal, but rather an institution whose strength lies in its reputational power and the idea that all states can and should be questioned for their practices.

Accountability as Leadership

The UPR was built on a simple idea: every country, big or small, should be willing to answer for its human rights record. That principle is what makes the system meaningful. When the US steps away from that process, it sends a clear signal that it is unwilling to live up to the same standards it expects of others. The decision does not just damage its reputation; it weakens the very structure of accountability that holds the international system together.

What suffers most are the values that give human rights their strength. Transparency becomes harder to demand, cooperation feels less certain, and the idea of shared responsibility begins to fade. The UPR only works when participation is universal. Once that breaks down, the foundation of equal treatment under international law starts to crack.

If the US truly wants to lead on human rights, it has to be part of the conversation. Rejoining the UPR would not erase its own failings, but it would show that leadership means being willing to listen as well as speak. Accountability has to begin at home.",https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/UN_1763153399.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 18:58:25.000668

Border czar Tom Homan strongly opposed the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) “special message” on immigration, saying the statement would encourage people to make a dangerous trek to the United States.

Homan told EWTN News on Nov. 14 that the “Catholic Church is wrong. I’m sorry. I’m a lifelong Catholic. I’m saying it as not only a border czar. I’ll say it as a Catholic. I think they need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church in my opinion.”

The bishops approved the message on immigration at the 2025 Fall Plenary Assembly in Baltimore on Nov. 12. “We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people,” the message said.

More than 95% of the American bishops voted to support the message. The bishops said in the message they “are bound to our people by ties of communion and compassion in Our Lord Jesus Christ” and “are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants.”

The bishops’ message cited Scripture such as Luke 10:30-37, referring to the good Samaritan who “lifts us from the dust,” and Matthew 25, in which “we see the One who is found in the least of these.” Floor debate on the measure included bishops’ discussion of “the One” referring to the face of Jesus Christ as seen in the migrant.

“The Church’s concern for neighbor and our concern here for immigrants is a response to the Lord’s command to love as he has loved us (John 13:34),” the statement said.

Homan said: “So according to [the bishops] the message we should send to the whole world is: ‘If you cross the border illegally, which is a crime, don’t worry about it. If you get … removed by a federal judge, that’s due process, don’t worry about it, because there shouldn’t be mass deportations.’”

He added: “If that’s the message we send the whole world, people are still going to put themselves in harm’s way to come to the greatest nation on earth.”

“We saw during the Biden administration, when there was no immigration enforcement, over 4,000 aliens died making that journey” and “40 million Americans died from fentanyl,” Homan said. Homan said he wants the Catholic Church to understand that secure borders save lives.

U.S. bishops acknowledged the need for secure borders in their special message, writing: “We recognize that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good.”

Homan said: “We’re going to enforce the law, and by doing that, we’re saving a lot of lives. One of the reasons no one talks about why we have the most secure border in the history of this nation is because [of] exactly what ICE is doing.”

“ICE has sent a message to the whole world: ‘Don’t give your life savings to come to [the] country, because you’re not gonna be released. You’re not going to cross [the] border illegally. You’re going to be prosecuted,’” Homan said.

President Donald Trump expanded use of deportations without a court hearing this year and ramped up federal law enforcement efforts to identify and arrest immigrants lacking legal status. The administration set a goal of 1 million deportations this year.

Besides criticizing the bishops’ opposition to indiscriminate mass deportation, Trump administration officials also have condemned an “activist judge” who issued a temporary restraining order mandating cleanliness and hygiene standards as well as adequate legal representation at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Illinois. Court records, advocacy groups, and detainees’ reports have included claims about the stench of sweat, urine, and feces at U.S. immigration facilities, worm-infested slop, and an insufficient supply of menstrual products.

‘Worst of the worst’

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a Nov. 14 statement to CNA: “DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists. 70% of illegal aliens ICE arrested across the country have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges just in the U.S. This statistic doesn’t account for those wanted for violent crimes in their home country or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists, etc. The list goes on.”

(Story continues below)

McLaughlin said: “We are a nation of laws, and, as America’s largest law enforcement agency, DHS is committed to enforcing those laws, all of which are just. Lawbreakers should unquestionably be living in a ‘climate of fear and anxiety,’ that they will be caught and sent home.”

In San Bernardino, California, Bishop Alberto Rojas granted a dispensation in July from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass for those within the diocese who fear deportation. The Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, similarly indicated in May that “no Catholic is obligated to attend Mass on Sunday if doing so puts their safety at risk.”

Pope Leo XIV on Nov. 4 said: “Many people who’ve lived for years and years and years, never causing problems, have been deeply affected by what’s going on right now.” Leo invited authorities to allow pastoral workers to attend to the needs of detainees.

He reminded that “Jesus says very clearly … at the end of the world, we’re going to be asked … how did you receive the foreigner? Did you receive him and welcome him or not? And I think that there’s a deep reflection that needs to be made in terms of what’s happening.”",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/homan.feb.13.2025.jpg?jpg,N,,2025-11-14 17:57:07.596558

Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem.
Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules — not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.
A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns.
But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.","The Transportation Department's new restrictions that would severely limit which immigrants can get commercial driver's licenses to drive a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court.

The court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can't be enforced right now.

The court said the federal government didn't follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to “articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety.” The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver’s licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said.

Duffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state's records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules — not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.

The court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.

“This is not a ruling on the merits of the case. Secretary Duffy will continue working to keep unqualified, foreign drivers off American roads,” a Transportation Department spokesman said.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office didn't respond immediately Friday to questions about the ruling. Newsom’s office has said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when issuing these licenses to noncitizens.

Duffy has said the Florida crash, along with fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year, highlighted questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only added to the concerns.

The driver in the Florida crash, Harjinder Singh, appeared before a judge in St. Lucie County, Florida, on Thursday, where his attorneys asked to continue his court proceedings into January as they prepare for trial. Singh has pleaded not guilty to three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter.

The new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner.

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.

Trucking trade groups like the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association have supported the new rule. There is a bill in Congress that would enshrine the new restrictions on commercial driver's licenses in law.

“For too long, loopholes in this program have allowed unqualified drivers onto our highways, putting professional truckers and the motoring public at risk,” said Todd Spencer, the trucking association's president.

Duffy has said that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.

Duffy has revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn’t enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he said earlier this week that he may take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don’t invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice admitted to the apparent snafu in a 10-page joint written status report on discovery.

Chief among the missing files is 13 days' worth of video footage recorded at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, according to the status report.

""Defendants have indicated that some video between October 19, 2025, and October 31, 2025, has been irretrievably destroyed and therefore cannot be produced on an expedited basis or at all,"" the filing reads.

The plaintiffs, for their part, say they are ""in the process of hiring an IT contractor"" who will work with ICE's discovery liaison and attorneys ""to attempt to work through issues concerning the missing video, including whether any content is able to be retrieved.""

The missing footage will be pursued, at least in some fashion, the status report says, but the plaintiffs say the issue is not paramount.

""While Plaintiffs intend to explore the issue of missing footage, Plaintiffs have communicated to Defendants that they are most concerned with obtaining the available surveillance videos as quickly as possible,"" the joint filing by the government and plaintiffs goes on.

The underlying class action litigation was filed on Oct. 30, premised on alleged violations of the Fifth Amendment due to confinement conditions at Broadview, the First Amendment due to counsel access issues, as well as various alleged violations of due process, internal ICE rules, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the federal statute which governs the behavior of administrative agencies.

The lawsuit begins with the following allegations:

Federal authorities are conducting a massive and inhumane immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area—Operation Midway Blitz. Under Defendants' authority, huge numbers of people are being arrested and detained. Most have been brought to what is being used as a de facto immigration detention facility right outside the city limits…where Defendants are perpetrating mass constitutional violations.

ICE agents are alleged to have violated a rule for immigration officers which reads: ""The use of threats, coercion, or physical abuse by the designated immigration officer to induce a suspect to waive his or her rights or to make a statement is prohibited.""

Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that when detainees requested ""basic necessities"" from ICE, officers responded ""with threats, abuse, or contempt."" The filing goes on to allege many detainees report ""being belittled or ignored by officers when they asked for food and water.""

One of the named plaintiffs in the class action alleges that she and others ""were denied water for 13 hours"" as ICE officers pretended ""they did not hear the requests,"" according to the filing.

""When people asked for necessities, officers would insult detainees or make light of their suffering,"" the lawsuit goes on. ""She saw a man who was very ill and appeared to be having a heart attack. The officers at Broadview laughed at him and made light of his medical emergency.""

On Nov. 4, Senior U.S. District Judge Robert W. Gettleman, a Bill Clinton appointee, signed off on a limited version of the plaintiffs' request for expedited discovery and set initial deadlines.

""Counsel are to confer regarding the individuals to be deposed, the length of time needed for the depositions, records on the amount of people being housed in the Broadview ICE facility cells, and a discovery plan,"" the minute order reads.

On Nov. 5, the court issued a temporary restraining order directing ICE to maintain a certain level of standards at the facility in accord with a laundry list of commands. The court also turned over discovery supervision to U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura K. McNally.

On Nov. 7, McNally directed the parties to ""promptly move forward with discovery"" before the restraining order expires to prepare for a hearing on the plaintiffs' requested preliminary injunction.

The preliminary injunction hearing was originally slated for Nov. 19, but after the submission of the joint status report and a subsequent hearing, the parties agreed to move the hearing back to Dec. 17.

Part of the agreed-upon delay seems to be due to lengthy emails requested as part of the discovery process, according to the status report.

""Defendants raised concerns that producing these emails, including identifying emails that may have been forwarded to other DHS officials for their response, would take close to a month to review and produce,"" the filing reads.

And, while the missing days of video may come up as an issue in the future, the detainees and the Trump administration appear to have come to an agreement about some of the surveillance footage.

From the status report, at length:

Plaintiffs request surveillance video from inside the Broadview facility captured by Defendants' equipment for a limited set of days, starting in mid-September 2025. Plaintiffs also request current video on a weekly basis. Defendants have agreed to produce video from September 28, 2025, to October 19, 2025, and also from October 31, 2025, to November 7, 2025. Plaintiffs are providing Defendants with hard drives for this production, and the parties expect that this initial production will be made shortly. The parties are discussing ways to ease the burden of production of video going forward, including by having Plaintiffs select random days for production rather than the production of all video on an on-going basis.",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-and-Noem.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 15:58:31.922830

Nine workers were taken into custody by immigration authorities at the Allston Car Wash last Tuesday.

The law firm representing them said some had work authorization cards in their lockers, but weren’t allowed to retrieve them.

The President of the Boston University College Republicans, who grew up in England, is taking credit for summoning ICE to the car wash.

In a post on X last week, Zac Segal wrote:

“I’ve been calling ICE for months on end. This week, they finally responded to my request to detain these criminals. As someone who lives in the neighborhood, I’ve seen how American jobs are being given away to those with no right to be here. Pump up the numbers!”

In another post on Thursday, referencing a Boston Globe article, he said:

“We must stand up for this country.”

A woman whose father, aunt, and cousin are among those being held in detention facilities told Boston 25 News her family is experiencing immense pain and uncertainty.

She spoke exclusively with Boston 25 News on the condition that her identity not be published or shown.

“None of my three family members has any criminal history. Their only crime is being immigrants,” she said through a translator. “We came here to work, and instead, we are fighting racism day after day.”

She said her family came to this country from El Salvador to escape poverty and gang violence.

“Please look beyond our status just as immigrants to see that we are hardworking people who came here to benefit this country and to work for this country,” she said.

Segal is referring to the College Republicans of America for comment.

Boston 25 News received the following statement from its president, Martin Bertao:

<i>We applaud Zac Segal, President of our Boston University College Republicans chapter, for his service to his community by reporting the presence of illegal aliens at Allston Car Wash, which resulted in the removal of nine illegals. Any person who enters this nation illegally is in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1325, and is therefore subject to swift removal by ICE. Zac Segal is a hero, and we are proud to call him one of our own. We call on all College Republicans to follow in the lead of this great patriot and notify their local ICE forces of any known illegal activity in their communities immediately.</i>

— Martin Bertao

“He’s tone deaf. That’s exactly what it is. He wants to sit on his soapbox and grandstand,” said attorney Todd Pomerleau. “He’s proud that he called ICE regularly. Why don’t you study a little bit more?”

Pomerleau, whose firm represents all nine workers, said five have bond hearings scheduled for next week and could be released from custody.

“None of these people have criminal records. None of them were arrested for a crime,” he said. “It’s the most uncivilized response we’ve seen in the history of the United States.”

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued the following statement about the ICE enforcement last week:

<i>On November 4, ICE conducted a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Allston, Massachusetts that resulted in the arrest of 9 illegal aliens including an illegal alien who chose to&nbsp;commit a felony&nbsp;by illegally re-entering the U.S. Three entered under the Biden administration, four were gotaways at the border, one entered illegally under W. Bush, and another overstayed his visa which expired under President Clinton.</i>

<i>For decades, politicians left our borders wide open. Now, thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem, we have the most secure border in American history.</i>

They are protected from deportation to their home countries due to the risk of torture, persecution or inhumane treatment, she said.

Ana Dionne-Lanier, who represents one of the nationals, told The Associated Press on Thursday the group arrived in Ghana on Nov. 5 and were put in a hotel. They are protected from deportation to their home countries due to the risk of torture, persecution or inhumane treatment, she said.

""We don't know the location of any of them,"" Dionne-Lanier said, adding that neither she nor her client's family has been able to reach him.

She said part of the group was sent by bus to an unknown border location between last weekend and Monday, while a second group, which included her client, was moved ""under heavy armed guard"" from the hotel around Wednesday.

The Ghanaian government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dozens of deportees have been sent to Africa from the U.S. since July after the Trump administration struck largely secretive agreements with at least five African nations — including Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan — to take migrants under a new third-country deportation program.

The Trump administration's deportation program has faced widespread criticism from human rights experts, who cite international protections for asylum-seekers and question whether immigrants will be appropriately screened before being deported.

The administration has been seeking ways to deter immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally and remove those who already have done so, especially those accused of crimes and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home countries.

Faced with court decisions that migrants can't be sent back to their home countries, the Trump administration has increasingly been trying to send them to third countries under agreements with those governments.

Last month, the Ghanaian rights group Democracy Hub filed a lawsuit against Ghana's government, alleging that its agreement with Washington is unconstitutional because it wasn't approved by the Ghanaian parliament and that it may violate conventions that forbid sending people to countries where they could face persecution.

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice argued in a federal court that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees. It said that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. it wouldn't send the deportees back to their home countries.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251114-ghana-deportation-gk-9c7d46.jpg",N,,2025-11-14 14:57:28.892408

Before next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.
One government official said MPs should face up to the huge public disquiet about an asylum and immigration system they believed was out of control.
“We know levels of migration and asylum are putting huge pressures on communities,” they said.
“If we don’t do this, there risks being no asylum system at all, particularly if it means Reform win the election.","Downing Street has warned Labour MPs it expects them to back radical plans to make the UK less attractive to migrants and refugees, as some backbenchers said they expected fierce resistance to proposals that one called “economically and culturally illiterate”.

The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, will set out her revamp of the asylum and migration system on Monday, with officials saying it will draw heavily on ideas used in Denmark, which has tight limits on family reunions and sends some refugees back if conditions improve in their home countries.

The Home Office plan will also include already-mooted ideas to change the way the European convention on human rights (ECHR) is interpreted by UK judges so as to make it easier to remove people without lengthy court cases.

Government officials are billing Mahmood’s crackdown as robust but also the only way to restore public trust in the asylum system, and to potentially see off the threat of a Reform UK government that would dismantle asylum altogether.

Asked if the government was confident backbenchers would not seek to block the plans, as they did in June with welfare measures, a Downing Street spokesperson said this would not be tolerated.

“The government was elect on a mandate to secure our borders,” he said. “And while I’m not going to speculate ahead of the home secretary’s announcement, we are focused on the need to fix the mess we inherited and restore order and control to our asylum system.”

However, the briefing of elements of the plan to rightwing newspapers, and particularly the emphasis on using the model of Denmark, which severely restricts family reunions and in some cases asks asylum seekers to hand over jewellery or other valuables to cover costs, prompted an immediate reaction among some Labour MPs.

“It’s economically and culturally illiterate,” one said. “Are we really going to take the wedding rings of victims of trafficking, tell Ukrainians they can never put down roots?”

Another MP said they expected widespread scepticism among colleagues. “The policy of chasing Reform will not build confidence but fear and does not represent the values the Labour party holds,” they said.

Another expressed doubt that the plans would pass a Commons vote. “Getting something this controversial through when strong would have been tough. But frankly any Labour MP that has seen their majority destroyed by the rise in the Lib Dems and Greens will likely say no,” the MP said. “Weak governments don’t get to push through controversial policy.”

Expected changes to the use of the ECHR to be announced by Mahmood would include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they would face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country.

Home Office officials described the plans as “the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times”.

Before next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.

The figure, which includes refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and others with no right to be in the UK, is a 23% increase in removals compared with the 16 months before last year’s election.

Despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a political headache for the government. So far this year, 39,075 people have made the journey, up 19% on the same point in 2024.

One government official said MPs should face up to the huge public disquiet about an asylum and immigration system they believed was out of control.

“We know levels of migration and asylum are putting huge pressures on communities,” they said. “Our generosity is drawing people in and the system is being gamed.

“If we don’t do this, there risks being no asylum system at all, particularly if it means Reform win the election. But there will be progressive elements. Denmark is a fair, tolerant and open country, with a centre-left government that has fought off the hard right through difficult choices.”

While this is an argument endorsed by a number of Labour MPs, especially those in seats where Reform UK will be the expected main challenger at the next election, others fear the government is putting off progressive voters and shedding mass support to the left, particularly to Zack Polanski’s Green party.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66b1e03713dd482377e05ceacd48c6a368df804/239_45_1324_1058/master/1324.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=081aa8fb8f97dc5df2ebf4ebf42c5d4e",N,,2025-11-14 14:57:33.126454

As reporters sift through the documents in the coming days, Trump’s relationship with Epstein is likely to remain in the spotlight.
“Trump knew of it,” he wrote, “and came to my house many times during that period.” “He never got a massage,” Epstein added.
In some cases, Epstein’s correspondence suggests the president knew more about Epstein’s criminal conduct than Trump has let on.
In that email, Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell, a former associate who was later sentenced for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors, that Trump was “the dog that hasn’t barked.” “[Victim] spent hours at my house with him,” Epstein wrote.","A slow drip of revelations detailing President Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein that have burdened the White House all year has turned into a deluge after House lawmakers released reams of documents that imply the president may have intimate knowledge of his friend’s criminal activity.

The scope of Epstein’s interest in Trump became clear Thursday as media organizations combed through more than 20,000 documents from the convicted sex offender’s estate released by the House Oversight Committee, prompting a bipartisan majority in the House — including up to half of Republican lawmakers — to pledge support for a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all files related to its investigation of Epstein.

In one email discovered Thursday, sent by Epstein to himself months before he died by suicide in federal custody, he wrote: “Trump knew.” The White House has denied that Trump knew about or was involved in Epstein’s years-long operation that abused over 200 women and girls.

The scandal comes at a precarious political moment for Trump, who faces a 36% approval rating, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC survey, and whose grip on the Republican Party and MAGA movement has begun to slip as his final term in office begins winding down leading up to next year’s midterm elections.

Attempts by the Trump administration to quash the scandal have failed to shake interest in the case from the public across the political spectrum.

The records paint the most expansive picture yet of Trump’s relationship with Epstein, the subject of unending fascination and conspiracy theories online, as well as growing bipartisan interest in Congress.

In several emails, Epstein, a disgraced financier who maintained a close friendship with Trump until a falling-out in the mid-2000s, said that the latter “knew about the girls” involved in his operation and that Trump “spent hours” with one in private. Epstein also alleged that he could “take him down” with damaging information.

In several exchanges, Epstein portrayed himself as someone who knew Trump well. Emails show how he tracked Trump’s business practices and the evolution of the president’s political endeavors.

Other communications show Epstein closely monitoring Trump’s movements at the beginning of his first term in office, at one point attempting to communicate with the Russian government to share his “insight” into Trump’s proclivities and thinking.

White House officials attempted to thwart the effort to release the files Wednesday, holding a tense meeting with a GOP congresswoman in the White House Situation Room, a move the administration said demonstrated its willingness “to sit down with members of Congress to address their concerns.”

But House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York accused the White House and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) of “running a pedophile protection program” for trying to block efforts to release the Epstein files.

The legislative effort in the House does not guarantee a vote in the Senate, much less bipartisan approval of the measure there. And the president — who has for months condemned his supporters for their repeated calls for transparency in the case — would almost certainly veto the bill if it makes it to his desk.

Epstein died in a federal prison in Manhattan awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking in 2019. His death was ruled a suicide by the New York City medical examiner and the Justice Department’s inspector general.

As reporters sift through the documents in the coming days, Trump’s relationship with Epstein is likely to remain in the spotlight.

In one email Epstein sent to himself shortly before his imprisonment and death, he wrote that Trump knew of the financier’s sexual activity during a period where he was accused of wrongdoing.

“Trump knew of it,” he wrote, “and came to my house many times during that period.”

“He never got a massage,” Epstein added. Epstein paid for “massages” from girls that often led to sexual activity.

Trump has blamed Democrats for the issue bubbling up again.

“Democrats are using the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax to try and deflect from their massive failures, in particular, their most recent one — THE SHUTDOWN!” the president wrote Wednesday in a social media post, hours after the records were made public.

Trump made a public appearance later that day to sign legislation ending the government shutdown but declined to answer as reporters shouted questions about Epstein after the event.

Trump comes up in several emails

The newly released correspondence gives a rare look at how Epstein, in his own words, related to Trump in ways that were not previously known. In some cases, Epstein’s correspondence suggests the president knew more about Epstein’s criminal conduct than Trump has let on.

In the months leading up to Epstein’s arrest on sex trafficking charges, he mentioned Trump in a few emails that imply the latter knew about the financier’s victims.

In January 2019, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff that Trump “knew about the girls,” as he discussed his membership at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s South Florida private club and resort.

Trump has said that he ended his relationship with Epstein because he had “hired away” one of his female employees at Mar-a-Lago. The White House has also said Trump banned Epstein from his club because he was “being a creep.”

“Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever,” Epstein wrote in the email to Wolff.

One of the employees was Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s survivors who died by suicide this year. Giuffre said in a civil case deposition that she never witnessed Trump sexually abuse minors in Epstein’s home.

Republicans in the House Oversight Committee identified Giuffre as one of the victims whose names are redacted in an April 2011 email.

In that email, Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell, a former associate who was later sentenced for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors, that Trump was “the dog that hasn’t barked.”

“[Victim] spent hours at my house with him,” Epstein wrote. “He has never once been mentioned.”

“I have been thinking about that...,” Maxwell replied.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the emails “prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.”

News over the summer that Trump had penned a lewd birthday card to Epstein, drawing the silhouette of a naked woman with a note reading, “may every day be another wonderful secret,” had sparked panic in the West Wing that the files could have prolific mentions of Trump.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/175e39c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+405/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc7%2F64%2F657e996b410bab1043fb835b5021%2Ftrump-96589.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 15:57:46.204838

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month.
Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits.
“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges.","This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.

Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMattersthe federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections.

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://img.lbpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/14090236/092225-calcity-detention-mv-cm-12-188378-wqfd2ygq-890822-VgOydNLg.webp,N,,2025-11-14 13:57:12.523413

Moments before the clash, protesters were singing and chanting. However, around 10 a.m., a large group of about 50 people crossed the protest barrier and tried to walk up to the facility, knowing they would be arrested, according to the Cook County Sheriff.

In addition to the arrests, the scuffle also resulted in four officers being injured, including two Broadview police officers, one Illinois State Police officer and a Cook County sheriff's deputy, according to Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson.

The Broadview officer and sheriff's deputy were transported to a hospital for treatment, while the state trooper was treated at the scene, according to Cook County Sheriff's Office.

The two Broadview officers and the deputy were transported to Loyola Hospital.

The crowd of about 300 protesters later began to disperse, according to the AP.

What they're saying:

""The violence by out-of-town protesters that has led to two Village of Broadview police officers, one Illinois State police officer, and a Cook County Sheriff’s deputy being injured this morning, with the two Broadview officers and the sheriff’s deputy being transported to Loyola hospital, is unacceptable and outrageous. I have repeatedly pleaded to protesters to raise their voices, not their fists. They have chosen their fists. These out-of-towners have chosen to brutalize police officers who have been protecting their free speech and protecting them against assaults by ICE agents. We will see them in court,"" said Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson.

The backstory:

On Wednesday, a federal judge said he could order the release of hundreds detained at the Broadview ICE facility — a significant legal setback for Operation Midway Blitz.

Attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union argued that Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained hundreds of individuals without serious criminal histories who should not have been held.

The case stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in 2018 accusing ICE of detaining undocumented immigrants without warrants, in violation of a consent decree.

The ruling affects hundreds of people who have been detained despite lacking prior criminal records. Attorneys said they are seeking the release of more detainees nationwide, noting that about 85% of individuals in ICE custody have no prior criminal convictions.

California is the only state where an audit of commercial driver's licences has been completed.","California is revoking 17,000 commercial driver's licences after an audit found they were given to thousands of immigrants who are no longer legally allowed in the US.

The Department of Transportation said California officials confirmed they ""illegally issued"" those licences ""to dangerous foreign drivers"", and the holders were notified their licences will expire in 60 days.

In August a truck driver who was not in the US legally killed three people in Florida, spurring the Trump administration to increase its efforts to keep undocumented immigrants out of commercial trucking and bus driving.

California Governor Gavin Newsom largely brushed off the administration's announcement as political.

The administration has been critical of California and other states who have given licences to people who are in the country illegally.

""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. ""My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses.""

Newsom's office has said the drivers whose licences are being revoked had valid work authorisations from the federal government.

The licences had incorrect expiration dates and violated a California law that they must expire on or before a person's legal status in the US ends, according to media reports.

""Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,"" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said, referring to the secretary's time on the MTV reality show Road Rules.

In September, one month after the deadly Florida crash, Duffy announced new rules to make getting commercial driver's licences difficult for immigrants. They also require states to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database and limit the licences to be valid for a maximum of one year.

In its notice of the new rules, the transportation department estimated 97% of current ""non-domiciled"" drivers - 194,000 people - will ""exit the freight market"" in the next few years. But, noting that there are 3.8 million commercial drivers in the country, it said it believed the rules will have a limited economic impact.

A federal appeals court this week put the new rules on hold as a lawsuit brought by a truck driver works its way through the courts.

Newsom's office has noted that the rules were not in effect at the time the 17,000 licences were issued.

California is the only state where an audit of commercial driver's licences has been completed. Other state reviews are expected to be released soon, though they have been delayed by the 43-day government shutdown that ended on Wednesday.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden was notified by two CBP officials Wednesday that agents could arrive over the weekend or early next week, and that officials have not disclosed any information about their operations, according to a statement from McFadden’s office.

The statement continued, noting the police department “will remain vigilant and continue to address and focus on the needs of our community as it does each and every day,” but his officers will not be “involved with any measures” of enforcement with CBP or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community,” she wrote in a post on the social platform X. “Everyone in our community deserves to feel secure and I am committed to doing all that I can to inform our community, help make sure everyone feels safe, and understands their rights.”

Lyles noted the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department is not involved in any federal immigration operations and said residents “should feel secure calling 911.”

“There continues to be rumors about enforcement activities and I would ask that everyone refrain from sharing unverified information,” the mayor continued. “Doing so creates more fear and uncertainty when we need to be standing together.”

“We will continue to work with local and state partners to do what we can to ensure the safety of our community,” she added.

On Oct. 25, a statewide initiative targeted offenders who posed significant threats to public safety.

Over the 10-day operation, ICE and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement arrested 230 immigrants lacking permanent legal status with ""egregious"" criminal histories.

The crimes include sexual assault, sexual battery, lewd and lascivious molestation of minors, possession of narcotics, possession of marijuana, possession of a controlled substance, burglary, attempted premeditated murder with a deadly weapon, and aggravated battery.

FDLE Commissioner Mark Glass spoke on behalf of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who could not make Thursday's announcement due to flight complications.

""You could come here and enjoy yourself all day long, but you're not going to enjoy it at the expense of others. We will expel you from there,"" said Glass.

The 10-day operation started on Oct. 25. Those arrested include 54 sexual predators, 164 offenders of sexual crimes, two convicted murderers, one convicted of drug trafficking and eight other felonies.

Both state and federal officials firmly suggest that immigrants lacking permanent legal status self-deport to avoid being held at one of the state's immigration detention centers.

""I suggest the only thing you can control is to volunteer yourself to come to this ICE station right here in Miramar, volunteer deport, and one of my aides to walk you to the airport and get you.""

""If you choose to stay in this country illegally and we find you, you will go through your immigration proceedings and ultimately be removed from this country,"" said Madison Sheahan, ICE deputy director.

Sheahan said that people who self-deprived could be eligible for up to $1,000 for a flight home.

Despite DeSantis' absence, state and federal officials repeatedly thanked him and the state for the successful operation that resulted in the apprehension of hundreds of criminals.

Both state and federal officials will continue to go after anyone in the country illegally.

The deal moved forward only because eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus voted with Republicans on Sunday night.
Golden is one of more than a dozen Democratic House members moved directly into Congress in 2018 from careers in the national security apparatus.
The most recent spending package appears to be nearly the same deal Republicans offered at the beginning of the shutdown.
This includes more than 13,000 air traffic controllers and about 50,000 workers in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).","On Wednesday night, President Donald Trump signed the government funding bill that ends the longest shutdown in United States history. The deal moved forward only because eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus voted with Republicans on Sunday night. In the House on Wednesday, six Democrats also crossed the aisle and joined 216 Republicans to pass the bill by a margin of 222 to 209.

One of the six House Democrats who voted for the bill on Wednesday was Jared Golden of Maine, a former Marine who has announced he will not seek reelection. Golden is one of more than a dozen Democratic House members moved directly into Congress in 2018 from careers in the national security apparatus.

The most recent spending package appears to be nearly the same deal Republicans offered at the beginning of the shutdown. The legislation will fund the entire government through January 30, 2026 as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and Congress, through September 2026.

The bill also restores full funding for food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. While the funding has been formally restored, food benefits have yet to arrive for millions of people.

While the shutdown has officially ended, its effects will still be felt by millions of workers and their families. In addition to the 42 million people who rely on SNAP in the US, some 670,000 federal employees were furloughed last month while another 730,000 workers, deemed “essential” by the government, were forced to labor without pay. This includes more than 13,000 air traffic controllers and about 50,000 workers in the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

While essential workers went unpaid, the repressive apparatus of the state continued to operate normally. Federal immigration agents, who continued kidnapping and detaining workers throughout the shutdown, were fully funded and paid on time.

The shutdown is ending on Republican terms. The Democrats provided the votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate without getting any guarantees that Affordable Care Act subsidies, the central plank of Democrats’ demands during the shutdown, would be restored. Instead of restoring subsidies, Republicans in the Senate only promised a vote by mid-December on extending them. There is no guarantee the measure will pass, with many Republicans already coming out in opposition. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to holding a similar vote in the House. And any bill that passed Congress would face a Trump veto.

If a deal to restore the subsidies is not reached by the end of the year, health insurance premiums will spike on January 1, 2026 for an estimated 24 million people who receive their insurance through the marketplace.

New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the Democrats who voted to end the shutdown, said she hoped by “mid-December” there would be a “bipartisan” effort to vote on a bill to restore the subsidies.

Throughout the shutdown, as workers went without paychecks and food stamps were withheld, Democrats and their adjuncts in the trade union bureaucracy never raised the prospect of mass collective action to stop Trump’s attacks on the working class and his dictatorial ambitions. Instead, the major airport workers’ and government unions released statements calling on the two big business parties to come together and reopen the government.

Playing their assigned role as “loyal” opposition, the Democrats intervened to end the shutdown at precisely the time the Trump administration was at its weakest. Last week, Democrats swept gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while a self-declared “democratic socialist,” Zohran Mamdani, garnered over a million votes in the New York City mayoral election.

A CNN/SSRS survey conducted at the end of October, shortly after some 7 million people participated in the “No Kings” protests, found Trump’s approval rating was only 37 percent, while 63 percent of respondents disapproved. Nearly 7 in 10 surveyed, 68 percent, agreed that things in America were “pretty/very bad.” Outrage over Trump’s attacks on immigrants is growing every day in the US, as more workers and community members are organizing independently against the kidnapping operations.

The Trump administration is not only widely hated but in an advanced state of political crisis. In the days leading up to the vote, Trump repeatedly called on Senate Republicans to abolish the filibuster and pass the budget through a simple majority. Republicans refused, and on Wednesday Trump fumed that the shutdown should never have happened and would not happen again if Republicans abolished the filibuster.

The spending bill is not just a straight funding proposal. It includes a ban on hemp-derived consumer products that were widely distributed in states where marijuana itself remains illegal. Lobbyists for the hemp industry estimate the ban will result in 300,000 job losses across retail and farming, a measure supported by both parties because it protects major cannabis firms and law enforcement interests.

In a special carve-out for Republican senators implicated in Trump’s failed coup, the legislation includes a payout for eight senators whose phone records were legally subpoenaed as part of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s aborted investigation into January 6. In addition to making it virtually illegal to subpoena a senator’s phone data without public disclosure, the bill would retroactively impose a $500,000 fine for each record subpoenaed.

The eight Republican senators eligible for the taxpayer-funded payday are Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Josh Hawley of Missouri. Tuberville, Lummis and Hawley all voted against certifying the 2020 election after the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Following the Democrats’ latest collaboration with Trump, a handful of Democrats in the House and running for office in 2026 are promoting the fiction that if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were replaced, the Democrats would become an opposition party that fights for the working class. This ignores two centuries of history and the class character of the Democratic Party, which no less than the Republicans is controlled by, and operates on behalf of, the financial oligarchy.

Notably, as of this writing, not a single Democratic senator, including “independent” Bernie Sanders (Vermont) has called for Schumer’s removal following the vote. This is because the Democratic Party as a whole, not just Schumer, supported reopening Trump’s fascistic government so the administration could continue its attacks on the working class.

Following the vote in the Senate, Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, the preferred candidate of the pseudo-left, despite revelations of his fascist tattoo and social media messages, released a video blaming Schumer and calling for his ouster as leader. Schumer’s “failure,” according to Platner, was because “they do not understand when we fight we win.” Platner added, “we need to elect leaders that want to fight,” and urged viewers to call their representatives and demand Schumer’s removal.

Platner’s appeal to “fight” is nothing more than a cynical effort to channel mass anger at the latest betrayal back within the Democratic Party, which has once again demonstrated that it is not an opposition to Trump but his partner in crime and an instrument of the corporate and financial elite. The end of the shutdown on Republican terms, the ongoing assault on social programs, the collaboration of both parties in attacks on immigrants and the preparations for dictatorship all show that workers cannot defend their interests through either of the big business parties.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/67c4ffdb-1183-4034-83ba-c89822129f19?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-11-14 15:57:50.610184

A video showed officers struggling with her as they walked out the front door. Her attorneys said in a statement Thursday that she was released from a detention center in Indiana on Wednesday night.

“We are thrilled that Ms. Santillana was released, and has been able to return home to Chicago where she belongs,” attorney Charlie Wysong said in the statement. “We will continue to pursue her immigration claims to stay in the United States. We are grateful to her community for the outpouring of support over these difficult days, and ask that her privacy be respected while she rests and recovers from this ordeal.”

Her case reflects the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics.

“I am so grateful to everyone who has advocated on my behalf, and on behalf of the countless others who have experienced similar trauma over recent months in the Chicago area,” Santillana Galeano said in the same statement. “I love our community and the children I teach, and I can’t wait to see them again.”

The recipients of both categories of statements include Knouse’s Whitehead colleagues and friends, whom she frequently messaged, Whitehead administrators, and [Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP (HAS)] investigators.
Where the consensual nature of Knouse’s and Sabatini’s sexual relationship is highly disputed, no more is required to overcome a motion for summary judgment.
… Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate as to any of the statements that fall into this category.","Where a defendant has moved for summary judgment on a defamation count, the motion should be denied as to one category of statements accusing the plaintiff of committing a sexual crime and of sexually harassing the subordinate women in his lab, but allowed with respect to any statement characterizing the plaintiff’s conduct in terms of the defendant’s subjective, non-provable opinion.

“The plaintiff, Dr. David Sabatini (‘Sabatini’), was a faculty member of the defendant Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (‘Whitehead’). In 2021, Sabatini resigned following an independent investigation into the culture of his laboratory (‘lab’), which concluded that he had violated Whitehead’s sexual harassment policy. During the investigation, Whitehead Fellow and defendant Dr. Kristin A. Knouse (‘Knouse’) told investigators that she had had a nonconsensual romantic relationship with Sabatini. …

“Sabatini claims that Knouse made a multitude of defamatory statements to several different groups and individuals. For the purposes of this motion, the statements can be broken down into two general subject matter categories. The first involves statements that Sabatini ‘assaulted’ Knouse, is a ‘rapist,’ is comparable to public figures such as Harvey ‘Weinstein’ or Jeffrey ‘Epstein,’ and is a ‘dangerous predator’ who ‘grooms’ the subordinate women in his lab. The second group of statements expresses Knouse’s feeling that she was ‘abused,’ was ‘coerced’ or ‘manipulated’ into having a relationship with Sabatini, and only acted enthusiastically in the relationship to keep Sabatini happy. The recipients of both categories of statements include Knouse’s Whitehead colleagues and friends, whom she frequently messaged, Whitehead administrators, and [Hinckley, Allen & Snyder LLP (HAS)] investigators.

“Applying the above legal framework to the first category of statements, they reasonably could be understood to state as a matter of provable truth or falsity that based on Knouse’s personal knowledge of Sabatini and their relationship, he committed some level of sexual crime against her (rape and/or assault), and has a history of sexually harassing the subordinate women in his lab. Where the consensual nature of Knouse’s and Sabatini’s sexual relationship is highly disputed, no more is required to overcome a motion for summary judgment. In addition, because some of the alleged statements impute the commission of a crime, Sabatini needs no proof of economic harm to proceed as to those statements. …

“Knouse counters that, understood in context, she only stated her nonactionable opinion — albeit with florid language, rhetorical hyperbole, and insults — that the relationship felt coerced and unwelcome because Sabatini leveraged his power to take advantage of her and other women. … Although Knouse may ultimately prevail at trial, where she employed objective words like ‘rape’ and ‘assault,’ the statements reasonably could be viewed either way. Thus, the issue is one of fact for the jury. …

“Turning by contrast to the second category of statements, they center on Knouse’s subjective feelings about Sabatini’s conduct (that she felt abused by the relationship) and her use of unflattering, but not potentially criminal, labels (i.e., Sabatini manipulated her, engaged in gaslighting, etc.). These characterizations of Sabatini are, indeed, matters of personal opinion that are not susceptible to proof as either true or false, and are therefore not actionable. … Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate as to any of the statements that fall into this category. …

“In sum, Knouse’s motion for summary judgment on Count 1 is allowed with respect to any statement characterizing Sabatini’s conduct in terms of Knouse’s subjective, non-provable opinion, consistent with the court’s guidance, supra, but is otherwise denied.”

The order stems from Margarito Castañon Nava v. DHS, a class-action lawsuit claiming federal agents unlawfully detained hundreds of migrants who were not subject to mandatory detention or final removal orders, a direct violation of a 2021 Biden-era decree inherited by the Trump administration.

In the ruling, Cummings accused DHS of holding migrants in “unsafe and unsanitary” conditions, saying detainees had been kept in overcrowded buildings “next to overflowing toilets.” The judge further said the department’s recent reversal on detention authority represented a “180-degree change” from previous legal interpretations.

'I have a country to run': Trump lambasts Democrats and some 'weak' Republicans while repeating claim that Epstein emails are a 'hoax'

Donald Trump has claimed on social media that Democratic lawmakers are doing “everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again”. This comes after emails released this week by the House oversight committee seem to suggest that the president may have known about Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct.

In his post on Truth Social a short while ago, Trump added that the latest batch of documents are being used to “deflect” from Democrats’ “bad policies and losses, specially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where there party is in total disarray and has no idea what to do”.

The president has yet to address the emails, or the wider record release, which included more than 20,000 pages. On Thursday, he took no questions from reporters at an executive order signing in the East Room. He has, however, been resolute about his stance online. White House officials have recapitulated his claims that the new information is merely a distraction.

“Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” Trump wrote on Friday. “Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat’s problem, not the Republican’s problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Summers about Epstein, they know all about him, don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

GOP senators disavow funding bill provision that allows them to sue government over phone records

Several Republican senators have expressed disapproval about a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed this week, which would allow lawmakers to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

“There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ’s outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted,” said senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, one of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained.

For his part, House speaker Mike Johnson has pledged to repeal the provision next week, and many House Republicans are incensed about the language in the bill.

“Interesting seeing my colleagues express outrage over this provision yet still vote for it when they could have been strong and not let the Senate jam the House,” said GOP member Greg Steube, who represents the Florida suncoast. “There was no reason this needed to be in the bill to reopen the government. The Senate used a crisis to pass an unethical provision and now the House is complicit.”

Americans should “raise hell” to protect US national parks through the “nightmare” of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to a former National Park Service director, amid alarm over the impact of the federal government shutdown.

Jonathan Jarvis claimed the agency is now in the hands of a “bunch of ideologues” who would have no issue watching it “go down in flames” – and see parks from Yellowstone to Yosemite as potential “cash cows”, ripe for privatization.

Jarvis, who led the NPS from 2009 to 2017, faced intense scrutiny, a five-hour grilling in Congress and calls for his resignation after closing all 401 national park sites during a previous shutdown, in October 2013.

He was certain, despite the backlash, that it was the right thing to do: keeping them open with a skeleton staff would have put parks and their visitors at risk, his team concluded.

Over the past month, hundreds of NPS veterans including Jarvis, 72, have watched aghast as most of the agency’s workers were furloughed during the longest shutdown in US history – while the Trump administration kept all national parks open.

There have been consequences.

A fire at Joshua Tree national park burned through about 72 acres. Yosemite faced a wave of illegal Base jumping. Yellowstone grappled with bear jams.

Vandalism included graffiti in Arches national park. A stone wall at Gettysburg national military park was damaged. Trash started to gather at various sites.

Thousands of NPS workers are typically around to guide visitors safely through parks, point them in the right direction, swiftly rescue them from danger, keep traffic moving, monitor wildlife and protect the landscape.

“You take all of that away – all of those employees – you basically are, on one hand, creating unsafe conditions for the visitor,” Jarvis said, adding: “And you’re putting basically these irreplaceable resources at risk.”

Trump reposted a Fox News segment on Truth Social a short while ago, with the caption “THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN HOAX”. In the clip, host Jesse Watters accuses Democrats of “launching a smear campaign disguised as a bombshell”, referring the tranche of emails released this week, which include correspondence from Epstein to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, calling Trump the “dog that hasn’t barked” and noting that the president “spent hours” at Epstein’s home.

Since House oversight Democrats released the emails, Trump has called them a “deflection” from the party’s performance during the record-breaking government shutdown.

Russia said on Friday it remains open to the idea of a summit with the United States in Budapest if it is properly prepared and based on agreements reached at the previous meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Alaska.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said contacts between Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and US secretary of state Marco Rubio would continue if needed.

The two sides announced the planned summit last month but Trump cancelled it soon afterwards, saying he did not want it to be a waste of time.

As the Trump administration and Texas governor Greg Abbott restrict free speech on college campuses, two professors at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) are suing the university for retaliation stemming from 2024 arrests at a peaceful campus protest.

History professors Ben Wright and Rosemary Admiral argue they should not have been arrested in the first place at the 1 May 2024 demonstration, where they were standing between their students and heavily armed law enforcement.

Following the arrest, the professors say their university engaged in retaliation by severely restricting their access to campus, vaguely ordering that classroom instruction and “employment/research related activities” were the only permissible reasons for them to show up at work.

“UTD wrongly banned these plaintiffs from campus entirely at first, falsely claiming a court required that,” said the professors’ attorney, Christina Jump. “No court required that.”

The professors’ 29-page complaint, filed in a district court in Texas, names UTD and the University of Texas system as defendants, as well as former UTD president Richard Benson, current president Prabhas Moghe, Abbott and Ken Paxton, the attorney general.

In addition to allegations that the defendants violated their civil rights, the professors also claim violations of the fourth and first amendments, arguing that they were unlawfully arrested without probable cause and later faced retaliation for peacefully protesting.

Trump puts intense pressure on Republicans to block release of Epstein files

Lucy Campbell

Donald Trump has cranked up his intense pressure campaign on congressional Republicans to oppose the full release of the justice department’s files related to Jeffrey Epstein, before a crucial and long-awaited House vote on the matter next week that scores of Republicans are slated to support.

The belated swearing-in on Wednesday of the Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva – which the House speaker, Mike Johnson, had refused for almost two months during the government shutdown – brought the number of signatures on Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna’s discharge petition to the 218 needed to force a floor vote on legislation demanding the Department of Justice release all of its investigative files on Epstein within 30 days.

It is expected that dozens of Republicans will vote for it, with the knowledge that their constituents want greater transparency about the affair and want them to hold the line. Representatives Don Bacon of Nebraska, Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania have expressed they would do so.

CNN reported that top officials summoned representative Lauren Boebert – one of four Republicans in the House who have signed the petition – to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and FBI director, Kash Patel, to discuss her demand to release the files. Trump had also telephoned her early on Tuesday morning, a day before Grijalva was due to be sworn in and provide the crucial final signature.

Trump also reached out to Representative Nancy Mace, another of the Republican caucus in the House who have signed the petition, but the two did not connect. Mace instead reportedly wrote the president a long explanation of her own personal experience as a survivor of sexual abuse and rape, and why it was impossible for her to change her position on the matter. She wrote on X that “the Epstein petition is deeply personal.”

Those failed lobbying attempts from the White House came as Democrats on the House oversight committee released three damning new emails that suggest Trump knew about Epstein’s conduct, including one in which the convicted paedophile said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls”. Another email described Trump as a “dog that hasn’t barked” and said he had “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.

The president’s team struck back, saying those documents had been cherrypicked, and Republican representatives followed up by releasing a much bigger trove of more than 20,000 files.

The US approved the sale of fighter jet and other aircraft parts to Taiwan for $330 million on Thursday, marking the first such transaction since president Donald Trump took office in January, Reuters reported.

“The proposed sale will improve the recipient’s capability to meet current and future threats by maintaining the operational readiness of the recipient’s fleet of F-16, C-130,” and other aircraft, the Pentagon said in a statement.

Washington has formal diplomatic ties with Beijing, but maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier. The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.

Taiwan’s presidential office, noting the arms sale was the first announced by the current administration, thanked the US government for continuing the policy of regularized arms sales to Taiwan and supporting Taiwan in enhancing its self-defense capabilities and resilience.

“The deepening of the Taiwan-US security partnership is an important cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,” presidential office spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement.

Just 29% of Americans support US military killing drug suspects, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds

Only 29% of Americans support using the US military to kill suspected drug traffickers without a judge or court being involved, a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The six-day poll, which closed on Wednesday as Washington continued a military buildup around Latin America that has focused especially on Venezuela, showed 51% were opposed to the killings of drug suspects and the rest were unsure where they stood.

In a sign of division within Trump’s party, 27% of Republicans in the poll opposed the practice, while 58% supported it, with the rest unsure. Three quarters of Democrats opposed the practice compared to one in 10 who supported it.

The Trump administration has ordered at least 20 military strikes in recent months against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coasts of Latin America, killing at least 79 people.

Human rights groups including Amnesty International have condemned the strikes as illegal extrajudicial killings of civilians, and some US allies have expressed growing concerns that Washington may be violating international law.

US Catholic bishops condemn Trump administration's immigration enforcement

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with news that the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a rare condemnation of president Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and advocated for “meaningful immigration reform”.

“We are troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship and the special nature of hospitals and schools,” the bishops said in a special message, the first of its kind in 12 years.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration efforts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The message echoes similar critiques made by Pope Leo, who has called for “deep reflection” about the way migrants are being treated in the US under Trump, Reuters reported.

The Trump administration has advanced an aggressive immigration agenda since taking office earlier this year. Trump has rescinded policy that limited immigration arrests near sensitive locations, including churches, hospitals and schools, and deployed federal agents across the US to ramp up such arrests.

In their message, the bishops expressed concern about what they described as “a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling” and immigration enforcement. They said they were saddened by the debate and vilification of migrants, and opposed “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.”

The bishops also raised concerns about conditions in detention centers, and what they called the arbitrary removal of legal status of some migrants.

“We recognize that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good,” the bishops said.

In other developments:

Donald Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the Jeffery Epstein files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed. The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.

The justice department on Thursday joined a lawsuit brought by California Republicans to block the state’s new congressional map, escalating a legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to give Democrats a better chance of retaking the House of Representatives next year. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump.

The BBC has apologised to Donald Trump over the editing of a Panorama documentary that led to the resignation of its director general, Tim Davie, and the BBC News chief, Deborah Turness. However, the corporation has rejected his demands for compensation, after lawyers for Trump threatened to sue for $1bn (£760m) in damages unless the BBC issued a retraction, apologised and settled with him.

James Comey, the former FBI director, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, asked a federal judge on Thursday to drop the criminal charges against them, arguing that Donald Trump’s hand-picked US attorney, who obtained the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed. The hearing at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia in front of Judge Cameron Currie marked the first time a judge considered one of several efforts James and Comey have made to dismiss the indictments before trials.

The Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell is the latest target of Trump’s retribution campaign against his critics, the congressman confirmed on Thursday. NBC News reports that Swalwell is facing a federal criminal investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, just as three other Democratic officials have faced in recent months.

Brendan Curran's office at The Resurrection Project in Pilsen, Chicago, Oct. 27, 2025.","A blue whistle dangles from the rearview mirror of Dominican Fr. Brendan Curran's car, swinging gently beside a wooden rosary as the priest drives through the shiny streets of Pilsen, Chicago's Mexican neighborhood. The whistle is more than just a keepsake or a symbol of solidarity.

""We use it every time we see ICE in the neighborhood,"" he said. ""It's what immigrant supporters have been doing lately — to warn people, to protect them.""

A rosary and a blue whistle hang around the rearview mirror of Dominican Fr. Brendan Curran’s car. Chicago residents have been using this kind of whistle to alert local immigrants of ICE raids, he said. (NCR photo/Camillo Barone)

Outside the car windows, murals of the Virgen de Guadalupe and banners reading ""Mi barrio - Pilsen"" flash by. Above, the low hum of helicopters drifts through the early afternoon air. Curran pauses mid-sentence to listen. ""They've been flying over our heads for weeks now,"" he said, his voice tightening. ""This is very recent and worrisome.""

A Dominican friar born and raised in Chicago, Curran serves as director of interfaith partnerships at the Resurrection Project, a community organization founded by six local parishes 35 years ago to address affordable housing, health care and immigrant rights. He is also a member of the International Dominican Commission for Justice and Peace, linking his local work in Chicago to a global movement for human dignity.

In Pilsen, where old Mexican bakeries meet newly built gentrifying coffee shops, the tension between sanctuary and surveillance is almost tangible. ""What was once about helping new arrivals get settled,"" Curran said, ""has now become about protecting the people who are already here.""

The urgency of his work mirrors the vision of Dominican Fr. Charles Dahm, the priest who founded the Resurrection Project decades ago. Dahm was born in Chicago and raised in the suburb of Elmhurst, but after doing ministry work in Bolivia, he returned to Chicago to co-found a peace and justice center, working on social issues like redlining and supporting refugees from Central America.

Murals depicting Mexican Catholic themes in Pilsen, Chicago, Oct. 27, 2025. (NCR photo/Camillo Barone)

In Pilsen, he helped establish the interfaith community organization and affordable housing programs, eventually merging them into the Resurrection Project.

Dahm recalled earlier waves of undocumented migration, but he said the current crisis is unprecedented. Residents stay home, paralyzed by fear of sudden raids. The organization has scaled up rapidly, channeling state funds into legal assistance and deploying lawyers to help families navigate detentions across multiple states.

""So much suffering""

In Pilsen, fear runs deep. Curran parks the car outside a modest two-story home, where two Mexican women — both undocumented — are waiting for him. He has known them for years through St. Pius V Parish, where much of his ministry is rooted.

In their small garden, surrounded by blooming geraniums and the clucking of hens, they serve sandwiches and tall glasses of agua con pepino, espinaca y apio, or cucumber, spinach and celery water. Hens, roosters and pigeons wander around the table as the women speak softly in Spanish.

They both asked to remain anonymous to protect their identities and ensure confidentiality.

As the first woman, 49, begins to tell her story, the thrum of helicopters interrupts the conversation. Curran looks up, shading his eyes. ""This is the new world we're living in now,"" he said quietly. ""This is a military helicopter. This is quite scary, like we're in a war zone. They're also trying to surveil. At night they use laser beams and take pictures to identify residents.""

When the sound of the helicopter finally fades, the woman folds her hands on the table and begins again. She left Guanajuato in 2001 with her husband and their three young children, determined to find a future they couldn't imagine back home. ""We arrived in Chicago relatively well,"" she said quietly. ""Everything was different from how it is now.""

They crossed through Mexicali, she recalled, the first attempt ending in capture by border guards. A week later, they tried again and made it through. In Chicago, her husband found work in construction while she stayed home to raise the children. Her sons now work alongside their father, rebuilding homes across neighborhoods.

Her voice drops as she explains that she remains undocumented. ""I've been in the process of getting a visa,"" she said, ""because in 2017 I was assaulted by a man with a knife while I was going to church once.""

That attack changed everything for her. It left her with fear, but also with eligibility for a special visa for victims of crime, giving her temporary work authorization and a Social Security number, she said. Her husband and children are tied to the same application, still waiting.

She takes a sip of water before continuing. ""2025 has been a year of profound stress, worry and isolation,"" she said. ""I continue to have hope for change. But I no longer have peace. I feel like I am living in a time of eternal frustration.""

Then she described Oct. 16 — a morning that still makes her tremble, she said. She had been at a flea market three miles south of St. Pius V Parish, selling clothes and small household items to make extra money. Around 10:30 a.m., a swarm of about 30 ICE officers swarmed the aisles.

""Everyone started running away. Some were caught,"" she recalled.

Among those caught was her friend, a woman with two children, one of them seriously ill. ""She's in a detention center in Indiana now,"" the woman said, her eyes distant. The memory floods back in fragments: the chaos, the fear, the voices rising above the noise.

""I heard other immigrants shouting as ICE tried to capture her, 'take me, not her!'""

She falls silent for a moment, then adds, ""I lived in fear for the next few days. I stopped renting my space in the market. It's been almost empty since that day."" Her gaze drifts toward the street beyond the garden, where the sound of another distant helicopter hums faintly in the sky.

The second woman, 52, listens and nods. When she begins, her words come out in a rush. ""I left Mexico 23 years ago in search of a better life,"" she said. ""Where I come from, there was a lot of violence. The poverty was intolerable.""

Her journey north was grueling. ""It took me about three weeks, and then I was turned away at the border. I almost died crossing the river, but others helped me.""

""Cuánto sufrimiento,"" her friend whispered softly while looking at Curran. ""So much suffering.""

The woman's eyes filled with tears. ""My son was taken away. I was separated from him on the plane from El Paso to Houston and then to Chicago. He was only six months old and had serious health problems. I had to pretend I didn't know him, even though I could hear him crying.""

Her husband's family in Chicago paid the smuggler $5,000 to return her baby. ""When I tried to regularize my status,"" she continued, ""I was advised by lawyers not to apply, because I had been rejected the first time I tried to cross."" She remains undocumented to this day.

At St. Pius V, she found what she calls her ""second family."" That's where she met Curran. She used to work as a babysitter, she said, until her oldest son's needs made that impossible. He has autism with high support needs and requires constant care.

Her other three children were born in Chicago: Two of her daughters are about to finish high school and the third is already working to pay for college. For years, her life revolved around the quiet rhythm of caregiving and community — work, school, church and home.

This year has shattered that fragile routine. ""2025 has been the most difficult year since I've been here,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""I live in constant fear of leaving the house. My daughters are terrified of losing me in deportations and beg me every day not to go out.""

She has stopped volunteering at a local food pantry and no longer takes her son to the park, once his favorite outing. A few months ago, she heard that immigration agents had taken people there. The panic that followed, she said, only worsened her son's anxiety. ""It has aggravated his autism,"" she added.

The fear now feels inescapable, she explained. Friends whisper about raids in the neighborhood. She knows of families who were torn apart: a father taken from his home in front of his children, another friend who simply never returned from work.

""The father of one of my daughters' school friends was taken in front of his house.""

She pauses, her hands folded on the table. Health insurance is gone. Food stamps have stopped. Hope, too, feels distant. ""I have no joy or hope at the moment,"" she admitted. ""I only trust in mutual help within our community.""

A new sense of fear

Curran, later sitting at his desk in his small office filled with boxes by the walls, Mexican piñatas, Guadalupe paintings and a poster of Pilsen's late Catholic activist Micaela ""Miquita"" Ibarra, said he remembers how, not long ago, new arrivals from Venezuela and Ecuador came to the city ""as kind of a place of refuge, a place where they felt that they had a decent shot at getting connected to family and loved ones.""

But things have ""radically changed now,"" he said.

""This is more of a situation of protecting the immigrant community where it is — people who are afraid to leave their homes or apartments out of fear that ICE agents would pick them up off the street.""

He described U.S. citizens, permanent residents and workers ""detained and harassed by immigration agents simply by their skin color, their accent or even by the name of their construction company.""

For nearly two decades, Curran has led Friday vigils outside the Broadview Detention Center, the ICE facility nearest to Chicago. But now, even those vigils are shadowed by new dangers. ""There have been snipers on the tops of buildings pointed at me doing prayer — a prayer vigil.""

""American Catholics need to know that we are witnessing people who have left daily Mass, driving after dropping off their kids to school and they get surrounded by ICE vehicles to demand their legal status,"" he said.

""I don't know of any U.S. law that calls for that in a public space where no one has you on a list, no warrant, no request for you — and that person is a legal permanent resident,"" he continued. ""Why would we select people simply because of their accent or dark skin?""

According to a press release from the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, Krasner addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva during an information meeting on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process for the United States. Krasner appeared alongside Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Los Angeles County Supervisor Holly Mitchell.

The Universal Periodic Review meeting focused on widespread concerns over U.S. noncompliance with Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the long-term use of national emergency powers without the required communication to the UN Secretary General. The DAO said this lack of transparency fails to maintain the United States’ obligations under international human rights law.

The press release states Krasner is calling on “all other reformed prosecutors to increase their advocacy, engagement and protection of marginalized communities as we fight for the human rights of all Americans, undocumented people, and our neighbors.” According to the DAO, Krasner argued that a representative human rights prosecutor’s office protects “Black, brown, and poor people as well as victims of crime, immigrants, wrongfully convicted people, and those who feel voiceless.”

“People deserve human rights. Philly deserves human rights,” Krasner said in the release. “And as your elected district attorney, I will protect your human rights.”

The DAO raised concerns in Geneva about the impact of federal policies on marginalized communities nationwide, citing aggressive immigration enforcement, militarization of law enforcement, and growing barriers to transparency. Officials at the UPR session emphasized that human rights violations in the United States remain “the lived reality” for communities disproportionately affected by federal crackdowns, racial discrimination and continued expansion of emergency powers.

The press release also highlighted efforts by local governments in Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles to implement reforms through executive orders, policy changes and community organizing. These reforms, the DAO said, represent meaningful resistance to federal overreach and reflect the role of local jurisdictions in protecting vulnerable communities.

In conclusion, the demands from officials remain clear: “No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal or they are meaningless.”

The big picture: Lawsuits by news organizations, the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU Illinois are driving orders to reform practices, release detainees and clean up the Broadview ICE facility.

The latest: A judge toured the Broadview ICE facility on Thursday to assess compliance with a court order to clean it and provide detainees with bedding, showers, medicine and access to lawyers.

While Department of Homeland Security officials have denied to Axios that Customs and Border Protection commander-at-large Greg Bovino is leaving Chicago, he has not been spotted in town for the past four days. Still, DHS says operations will continue here.

Zoom in: Here are five ways to report agent violations.

Warrantless searches and arrests can be reported to the National Immigrant Justice Center, which recently secured the release of 13 detainees and the consideration of 615 more, hundreds of whom could be released next week.

Violations of a temporary restraining order against body slamming, use of tear gas without warning and failure to show IDs during raids can be reported to the attorneys and news organizations that filed the suit that triggered the TRO.

Unlawful swapping or removal of license plates by federal agents can be reported to the Secretary of State's Office at platewatch@ilsos.gov or 312-814-1730.

Violations of the Trust Act and Welcoming City ordinance, including the use of city property to stage immigration operations in Chicago, can be reported to the City Council Committee on Immigrant and Refugee Rights here.

Aurora and Evanston have enacted similar laws against using city property for staging and arrests.

Immigration raids in Evanston can be reported to Evanston police through 911 or the non-emergency line, 847-866-5000. EPD will send a supervisor to gather IDs of federal agents and inquire about the aim of the operation.

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss tells Axios that his police have already collected agent IDs, ""which is a first step toward holding these violent lawless thugs accountable.""

Shabana Mahmood is expected to set out plans to deter migrants from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport those who do, in a statement to MPs on Monday.

She is understood to have based some of the changes on the approach in Denmark, having dispatched officials there last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Mahmood is also expected to be preparing changes to human rights legislation to make it easier to deport people who cross the Channel in small boats.

Changes would include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they would face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country, the Telegraph reported.

Home Office officials described Mahmood’s plans as “the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in modern times”.

Before next week’s announcement, the Home Office announced it had removed or deported 48,560 people from the UK since Labour came to power.

The figure, which includes refused asylum seekers, foreign criminals and others with no right to be in the UK, is a 23% increase in removals compared with the 16 months before last year’s election.

Mahmood said: “Nearly 50,000 illegal migrants have been removed or deported since the election. We’ve ramped up enforcement, deported foreign criminals from our streets, and saved taxpayers millions.

“I pledge today to scale up the removal and deportations of illegal migrants and do whatever it takes to secure our borders.”

The government has also sent about 100 people back to France under the “one in, one out” returns deal for those who cross the Channel in small boats.

But, despite the removals, small boat crossings continue to be a major political headache for the government.

So far, 39,075 people have made the journey this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures.

The figure is up 19% on the same point in 2024 and up 43% on 2023, but remains 5% lower than the equivalent point in 2022, the peak year for crossings.

On Monday, the Home Office confirmed a second man had re-entered the UK by small boat having been returned to France under the “one in, one out” deal.

The government said he would be deported back to France shortly and insisted his immediate detection and detention showed the system was working.

Denmark’s tighter rules on family reunions and restricting some refugees to a temporary stay are among the policies being looked at.

Some research has suggested that deterrence policies have little impact on asylum seekers’ choice of destination, but a 2017 study said Denmark’s “negative nation branding” had proved effective in limiting asylum applications.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11e51f0bd9f6224f4ddc40a2200eeed4a471d2fd/421_0_1773_1418/master/1773.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=921c8df64924cee74ecf9758cadb19fe",N,,2025-11-14 07:56:19.142023

“When we’re talking about the people who are being exploited, who’s exploited more, of course, than the undocumented?” Nessel said.
For example, explained Teresa Hendricks, the Executive Director of Migrant Legal Aid, when they are working to investigate farms for potential labor trafficking violations, they would normally turn to the Department of Labor for help with assessing those violations.
That lack of ability to work with federal agencies has also impacted Nessel’s own work, she explained.
The burden on groups like Migrant Legal Aid has increased exponentially — Hendricks noted that they get calls nearly every day asking for help with questions about emergency estate planning, managing mortgages and custody of children when someone is being deported imminently.","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel met with migrant advocates in Grand Rapids at a Thursday roundtable to discuss the impacts of federal policy under the Trump administration on their ability to do their work, especially around concerns of immigration detention and deportation.

Migrant Legal Aid, which hosted the roundtable, as well as Puertas Abiertas, a Grand Rapids-based organization focused on helping Latinx victims of domestic violence and human trafficking, described situations where federal enforcement had in the past been helpful or necessary to help victims of trafficking or exploitation, but now came with a high risk of detention or deportation for those very victims.

“When we’re talking about the people who are being exploited, who’s exploited more, of course, than the undocumented?” Nessel said.

For example, explained Teresa Hendricks, the Executive Director of Migrant Legal Aid, when they are working to investigate farms for potential labor trafficking violations, they would normally turn to the Department of Labor for help with assessing those violations.

“In fact, it’s been the opposite, to the point where, in Michigan, if a grower is being investigated by us, they will call DOL to get an inspection, which is basically a whitewash, to say, look, they can’t find anything,” Hendricks said.

That’s also a question of an ability to engender trust in workers regardless of immigration status, Hendricks said, which called the organization’s “secret little superpower.”

Meanwhile, Alejandra Garces Pozo, a farmworker outreach specialist with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that she has had many people reach out to her to cancel their benefits, including Medicaid or food assistance, because of fears that the Department of Homeland Security could be accessing their data.

“We’re seeing the struggles and the changes in our programs, in our departments, like with helping people apply for state benefits, like whether it’s Medicaid or food assistance or childcare or state emergency relief,” Pozo said. “I’ve had a lot of clients call me so stressed to the point where by the time I’m like, ‘What is it that you want me to do?’ She’s like, ‘I want you to take my benefits away. I don’t want benefits anymore’.”

Those data sharing concerns have been the target of a number of suits joined by Nessel’s office, as she noted in the roundtable, including injunctions on data sharing with Homeland Security regarding SNAP food assistance benefits and Medicaid.

“I know why people are scared and don’t feel safe and don’t want to participate in programs that they are eligible under law to participate in need and need and badly need,” Nessel responded.

She added that her own concerns about data privacy under the Trump administration, especially tax return data from the IRS, led her to actually stop hosting trainings with senior citizens on protecting their personal information.

“How am I now trying to tell people how to protect their Social Security number when I don’t even know who has their Social Security number?” she said.

That lack of ability to work with federal agencies has also impacted Nessel’s own work, she explained. Her office will work on a case involving something as serious as sex trafficking, but when the FBI or Homeland Security get involved, they often instead detain and try to deport the victims.

“It’s very, very difficult to be a state attorney general, working with the locals, working with the county, working with MSP (Michigan State Police). We just have a really difficult time doing this work when we don’t have the federal agencies involved,” Nessel said, adding that some powers, like granting visas to victims, are outside of her power. “The trust is not there that they’ll treat people who are victims like victims instead of like criminals.”

“Our clients are in so much fear of even calling law enforcement just because of the situation that is going on with Homeland Security,” added Elizabeth Centeno, a bilingual youth group facilitator with Puertas Abiertas. “They’re just terrified. They don’t want to call 911. They don’t trust them.”

Claudia Annoni, the executive director of Puertas Abiertas, also noted that threats of immigration enforcement are often weaponized against victims of domestic violence or trafficking.

“It adds also to the level of intimidation, because if the perpetrator is a legal citizen here in the United States and you’re not, that is an easy one,” she said. “You say something, and I’ll call immigration on you.”

Nessel responded to Centeno to note that that hesitancy makes it harder to identify victims or witnesses to crimes. She also added that masked and unmarked law enforcement vehicles or uniforms make it hard for people to tell if they’re being stopped by actual police or immigration agents, as opposed to people posing as them.

“It’s really damaging for all of law enforcement,” she said. “It’s creating that confusion in the communities.”

Another concern raised at the roundtable was the availability of grant funding, and how challenging new rules regarding diverse or inclusive language have created new challenges for groups like Puertas Abiertas to even function.

“The reality is … we serve this community. And when you’re applying for a grant or you’re applying to a foundation, you aren’t gonna lie, ‘Well, we serve people.’ We serve the Latinx community,” Annoni said. “Who do we trust that we can send a letter, a proposal to receive funding.”

Molly Spaak, deputy director and attorney at Migrant Legal Aid, said that their organization had gone through a thesaurus to find different language to use when their $300,000 federal grant was cut — over half of their annual budget.

The burden on groups like Migrant Legal Aid has increased exponentially — Hendricks noted that they get calls nearly every day asking for help with questions about emergency estate planning, managing mortgages and custody of children when someone is being deported imminently. That falls outside of their normal scope of work, and means that they often have to direct people to outside, private lawyers — who are often very expensive.

“I think a key takeaway is that all of this happens so quickly and it’s so confusing, and our clients are usually terrified by this whole experience,” Spaak said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_2994-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 07:56:22.477850

“President Sheinbaum is working and managing these conversations separately from the ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration,” Ruiz Soto said.

Inhumane Treatment on Deportation Flights The enormous growth in flights is not the only concern.","Human Rights First just released its latest ICE Flight Monitor report tracking deportation flights through October 2025. This project was originally started by Tom Cartwright over five years ago, and when Human Rights First absorbed it earlier this year, they took on one of the most important immigration data projects in our research ecosystem right now.

Under the current Trump administration’s aggressive deportation agenda, this data is an essential window into this otherwise largely invisible architecture of lawlessness, violence, and forced repatriation. We’re spending enormous amounts of public money on this part of the system, from $7,000 to $26,000 per flight hour according to the report, and yet it appears that many of these deportations may actually violate national or international law, let alone are conducted in fundamentally inhumane ways.

I want to share some of the main findings and my own key observations with you here as a way of encouraging you to learn more about this project. You can also sign up to get new monthly reports as they come available from Human Rights First.

ICE Flight Tracker: Start with the Basics

Let’s start with the basics of the data we’re looking at. The ICE Flight Monitor tracks three types of immigration enforcement flights.

First are deportation flights that remove people from the U.S. to other countries. These include “third country” transfers, where the Trump administration is sending people to countries they’re not even citizens of, a tactic that’s both punitive and possibly illegal in many cases.

Second are domestic transfer flights, or “shuffle” flights, that move people between detention centers within the United States. These aren’t just about logistics. Transfers are a way for ICE to limit access to immigration attorneys, displace and confuse people in detention so they don’t even know where they are, and keep detainees compliant so they don’t speak up about their rights.

Third are removal-related flights that support the deportation apparatus but aren’t dedicated deportation or transfer flights, like when carriers move between hubs to set up for other operations.

These differences are important when trying to making sense of the data in the flight tracker, because, to be honest, it can get a bit overwhelming if you don’t hav a framework for conceptualizing this work first.

Records Numbers of Flights to Record Numbers of Countries

Like pretty much all enforcement metrics under this administration, the numbers are all record-breaking. Overall, the ICE Flight Monitor has documented over 10,672 total flights during the Trump administration so far. Most are those interior shuffle flights, but deportation flights are also well above previous highs. October alone saw a record 1,014 domestic shuffle flights—the highest on record—plus 199 deportation flights, which is above, but not quite as dramatically above, historic levels.

Altogether, the Trump administration has conducted 4,183 deportation and deportation-related flights since January. That more than the number conducted in FY 2024 (with three more months), when 3,483 deportation and deportation-related flights were conducted.

I would say that the deportation flights specifically are higher but not dramatically higher than the Biden administration. Where we really see the most dramatic increase is flights between detention facilities, which corresponds to the massive growth in that infrastructure. I still don’t think the Trump administration’s astronomical claims about deportation numbers are matching up to reality, but we are certainly seeing an increase in deportation flights overall.

The data on shuffle flights is a powerful compliment to my work on detention data and shows why we need multiple projects and partners working in tandem to understand the full scope and impact of the detention system. You can’t understand detention without understanding how people are being shuffled around the country, often deliberately to make it harder for them to access legal help. This is on top of locating detention centers in rural areas, which makes medical services, legal services, and contact with family members all much more difficult.

The geographic reach is also unprecedented, and reflects the deeper fact that the US deportation apparatus is a global apparatus, not just a national one. From January through October, the administration conducted removal flights to 77 countries—a 79 percent increase over the same period in 2024. That includes 24 countries that had never received ICE flights since tracking began in 2020, like Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan, and Rwanda.

Inhumane Treatment on Deportation Flights

The enormous growth in flights is not the only concern. ICE’s practice of dehumanizing treatment and disregard for basic dignity extends to the treatment of people on these flights.

People on these flights are often restrained with handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons for the entire journey, even when they pose no apparent security threat. Even worse is ICE’s use of something called the WRAP—a full-body restraint suit that prevents people from moving their arms or shifting position. Medical experts warn it can cause severe physical and psychological distress. According to the report, it’s been used as punishment when people ask to speak with their attorney or express fear of deportation. One man who was bound from shoulders to feet on a September military flight to Ghana reported lasting trauma and a leg injury that left him with a limp.

Flight attendants have reported that emergency procedures provide little guidance for evacuating restrained passengers. Some crew members say pilots told them during briefings that evacuating detained individuals in an emergency wasn’t even a priority.

And here’s the thing that should get more attention: many people on these flights don’t even have deportation orders. They may not have had their full day in court but are being deported anyway. Many people on these planes could be refugees or asylum seekers who might have qualified for protection if they’d been allowed to complete the legal process. I’ve written before that asylum grant rates are really low, so, sure, the changes are slimmer than ever, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay.

The Human Work Behind this Crucial Data

I want to say something about how this research actually happens, because when reports look this clean and polished, people assume it’s just numbers scraped off a website or obtained through some records request. The reality is much messier and more human, as anyone who actually does this work can attest.

I remember sitting down with Tom when he was looking for a home for this project. He walked me through how he does this work, and it’s incredibly impressive. It’s not just some grand automation project where you push a button and you get data back. It’s about really understanding how international flight tracking systems work, what different tracking platforms offer, how the government is trying to hide data about these flights, and developing deep knowledge about flight tracking around the entire world.

As I try to tell my students, the line between quantitative and qualitative research isn’t as bright as people think. There’s no data-driven research in the immigration space that isn’t also deeply qualitative, relying on subjective analytical decisions and specialized knowledge, not just algorithms and formulas. And this project profoundly illustrates that.

I’m grateful to everyone at Human Rights First for taking it on and ensuring it continues. Please read the full report below.

Video of a daycare raid in Chicago went viral last week, showing armed federal agents dragging a teacher from Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center as children watched in terror. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a press release that agents detained the woman as she fled into her workplace, describing her as an asylum-seeker who had recently arranged for her two children to join her in the United States.

To the families at Rayito de Sol, a bilingual and bicultural daycare, the scene was something else entirely: a show of force that shattered their sense of safety.

Maria Guzman, whose two children attend the center, said she’s still shaken by what she saw and what her community has endured in recent months as Border Patrol and ICE agents have appeared across Chicagoland. “They clearly see that it’s a daycare,” she said. “And so if you are a person with a gun and you see that you’re going into a daycare, they made a choice to drag her out of there. That’s not about bringing someone to justice—that’s an abuse of power.”

Guzman, the daughter of immigrants, has joined a growing network of parents organizing “rapid response” patrols and safety checks at local schools. (In a statement, “ICE is NOT targeting schools or daycare centers,” DHS’s Office of Public Affairs insisted to Mother Jones in an emailed statement. “The media continues to peddle false narratives that are leading to an 8000% increase in death threats against federal law enforcement.”) She says she supports arresting “the worst of the worst,” as former President Donald Trump has called them, but believes what’s happening now is something very different.

“Armed agents in masks and unmarked cars are going after workers—landscapers, food vendors, daycare teachers,” Guzman said. “It’s getting to a point where it’s just too much. It’s too much to handle for our families. It’s too much to handle for our kids. Our kids are fearful.”

====

Al Letson: Can, can you kind of tell me a little bit about Rayito [Rayito de Sol Spanish Immersion Early Learning Center]? Like what’s it like?

Maria Guzman: It’s a Spanish immersion daycare, meaning that they fully immerse the kids. As soon as they come in, they teach them Spanish, their Spanish music in the background. All of the staff are Spanish speaking.From the moment you drop your kids off and to the moment you pick them up, um, they are listening to the language and learning about the culture.

They have lessons on the flags and each of the countries of Latin America and their cultures and their traditions. It’s a beautiful opportunity for both [the] children of immigrants and of Latin American descent to be immersed in our beautiful community.

Al Letson: Can you tell me how things feel in the Chicago land area since the crackdown from ICE?

Maria Guzman: It’s been scary. It’s terrifying to think that at any moment, trucks will come in and just bombard our community. Armed agents who are taking our lawn workers, who are taking our daycare workers who are taking our street vendors.

It’s a nightmare. We never thought that this was going to be something that we’d have to face.

Al Letson: We’ve seen immigration do stuff, but we’ve never seen it like this. Like I don’t think I’ve ever seen the country, you know, masked agents coming into a community and, and just taking people off the streets.

Maria Guzman: They’re cowards. They know they’re not doing something right. They’re not wanting to show their face[s] because they know that at the end of the day, justice needs to be served and they cannot take people in this way.

This is a country built of immigrants. It’s too much to handle for our families. It’s too much to handle for our kids. Our kids are fearful and it’s just heartbreaking.

Al Letson: How has it affected your children?

Maria Guzman: You know, they’re still little. They live in a world where their worries are, “Do I have to eat my vegetables? Do I have to take a bath? Can I just play? Many of our communities feel that law enforcement is not on their side. To have conversations with our kids to say, those people who are supposed to be serving and protecting you are abusing their power. Covertly.

The lawlessness in other countries is the reason why people come to this country.

Al Letson: So let’s talk a little bit about what happened at the, at the daycare. Um, my understanding is that ice, uh, came through and arrested a teacher. Like, did they go into the building? Did the children see them do, like, how did that play out as far as, you know?

Maria Guzman: Yes, all of the above. They were behind the teacher as she sought to go into work. They dragged her out. It took three of them to drag her out. One of the officers then forced his way into the building [and] asked for documentation from someone who was not the teacher that they claimed to be looking for

It was hard to watch the terror in the faces of the teachers. The students saw it happen. There are students who are traumatized right now, who are fearful of going back to school. It’s just a horrendous situation where they’ve caused trauma in these children that is going to be so hard to move from.

Al Letson: The thing that struck me and and my producer Ashley is that what we are in right now is really a battle of, of two narratives. When ICE released their reports about who the teacher was, they really played her up like she was the worst person in the world, and we had to get her out of this country. Do you know this teacher at all?

Maria Guzman: Yes, I do. There is no truth to that. She is a family woman. We as a community trust her and we trust this organization to have vetted their teachers.

Al Letson: What are the actions that you are taking to take care of your community and really push back against this tide of immigration enforcement?

Maria Guzman: I think it’s twofold, right? I represent, proudly, the parents at this daycare. And, on the same hand, I also represent being an immigrant.

I’m the daughter of immigrants; proudly bilingual, proudly bicultural. This is the moment where we do not retreat. Everybody needs to say that this is enough because it is not the country that my children deserve. It is not the country that all of our children deserve. This divisiveness and this narrative that people are here to harm us or to take away our jobs – they’re trying to create an us versus them narrative. We are all one community and we should all be taking care of each other.

I’m using my voice. I’ve been fighting for immigrant rights in my free time for 20 years, um, for young, young people, for children of immigrants who came here when they were little and deserve an education, um, because their parents came here to give them a better life.

Like all of that is just playing into, um, what has happened this week because we cannot afford to stay quiet any longer.

Al Letson: Yeah. How has the daycare changed since this incident? And I know it’s only been a day or two, but, but what shifts have happened there?

Maria Guzman: Well, it’s been closed. Um, it’ll remain closed until next week. Um, uh, you know, a group of parents have come together to ensure that, you know, we feel like we’re safe and our children are safe, and, you know, our community of teachers are obviously safe because this is.

Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident. This is probably going to continue to happen in our communities. So we want to make sure that we all know our rights, that we have protocols in place.

We can go as back to normal as possible, but it’s, it’s going to be hard. It’s going to be something where we are going to build a coalition of parents. We’re gonna build a coalition of community, um, so that we have our support and we, and then, you know, the daycare knows that they have our support.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251114_ice-chicago-raid_2000px.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-14 11:58:48.178985

Immigration courts have always operated with unique features. The system is part of the executive branch – not the judicial branch – and housed under the Justice Department. They are run by judges who settle questions like whether to order an immigrant deported or grant them asylum. Over the past decade, the courts’ backlog of cases grew more than eightfold, hitting a high of 3.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2024, according to an analysis by TRAC, a data-gathering organization.

The U.S. immigration court system is “in crisis” because of its high caseload, as well as a need for increased funding and a greater focus on high-priority cases, says a report published on Thursday by the Migration Policy Institute.

Why We Wrote This

Immigration courts play a significant role in deciding who can stay in the United States. The Trump administration is transforming this system to speed up removal proceedings and detain more people in the process.

Typically inconspicuous, immigration courts have drawn public attention this year. In March, the government admitted that the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador violated an immigration judge’s earlier order banning his removal to that country. Federal law enforcement this spring began widespread detentions of people present for immigration court hearings, and arrested New York City Comptroller Brad Lander at an immigration court in June. Faith leaders have organized to accompany immigrants to their hearings for moral support.

The Trump administration cites efficiency to justify some of its recent changes – including assigning military lawyers to serve as immigration judges – and touts a substantial reduction in pending cases. Critics, meanwhile, say the moves trample the due process rights of immigrants, such as having their case heard. As the administration seeks to expand its deportation campaign, immigration courts are likely to stay in the limelight.

How does immigration court work?

There are 73 immigration courts nationwide, with hearings run by about 600 immigration judges appointed by the Justice Department. The government recently onboarded additional judges, some serving temporary terms.

Immigration court is a system of administrative law. Some observers call its proceedings “civil” – as in noncriminal. But these courts don’t follow federal civil-procedure rules like district courts do.

“Immigration court isn’t really a court,” at least not as outlined in Article III of the Constitution, says Alison Peck, author of “The Accidental History of the U.S. Immigration Courts.” “It’s not part of the independent judicial branch of government.”

Immigration judges decide who gets deported and who gets relief, such as asylum – if the applicant seeks protection as a defense against deportation. These judges can order immigrants deported for a variety of reasons, such as entering the country illegally, overstaying a visa, or committing a crime unrelated to immigration. Immigrants don’t need convictions from state or federal courts before they’re ordered removed in this administrative setting.

A notice to appear starts the process in immigration court, known as removal proceedings. Noncitizens before this court – called respondents – are entitled to lawyers. But because these respondents aren’t criminal defendants, they lack the right to legal counsel at the expense of the government. Children often appear in immigration court without representation.

Immigration judges don’t always have the final say. Within 30 days, respondents whose cases were denied may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Subsequently, noncitizens may petition a federal circuit court of appeals for review, then the Supreme Court.

How backlogged is the court system?

As of August, there were 3.4 million cases pending in immigration courts. The backlog often results in yearslong waits for hearings, which is a point of frustration for pro-enforcement and pro-immigrant advocates alike.

Last fiscal year, the number of pending cases shrunk by more than 700,000 cases, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts. That office says there were more than 4.18 million pending cases at one point, a higher figure than TRAC has reported. Observers attribute the drop to a variety of factors, including fewer new cases as illegal entries plummet and more respondents placed in detention, where cases might move faster.

Experts of the court say delays in adjudication can mean immigrants build up more ties to the U.S. while they wait, such as landing jobs and forming families. Critics say unauthorized immigrants who want to stay are incentivized to prolong or evade court proceedings. At the same time, the backlog delays people with legitimate asylum claims from receiving a decision on their request for protection.

How have immigration courts changed under Trump?

The administration has sought to speed up removal proceedings, detain more people in the process, and pursue more fast-track deportations that can bypass the courts.

“There’s been a real focus on things being faster and more efficient – and a very, very black-and-white application of the law,” says a member of the National Association of Immigration Judges, who asked not to be named due to retaliation fears and restrictive orders on speaking with the media.

Policy changes set by the administration have rolled back “previous safeguards” that were “almost to the level of law, because those policies were so ingrained in the immigration system,” says the immigration judge, who is not speaking on behalf of the Executive Office for Immigration Review or the broader Justice Department overseeing immigration courts.

A shift toward more detention has had the greatest impact, says the judge. A decision this year from the Board of Immigration Appeals says immigration judges lack the authority to release certain immigrants from detention on bond. Detainees are challenging what they consider unlawful detentions through habeas corpus petitions in federal district court.

In other cases, the Board of Immigration Appeals has empowered immigration judges to reject an asylum application if the form is incomplete, or if the immigrant doesn’t establish eligibility on first impression of their case.

Media reports have also documented mounting arrests of immigrants at immigration courts – with and without dismissal of their cases. The government is often preparing those detained for fast-track deportations called “expedited removal,” which can be carried out without a final order from an immigration judge. Immigration advocates say the possibility of arrest might deter respondents from attending hearings. There’s also a catch-22: Not showing up could result in a deportation order in the immigrant’s absence.

Is the administration scaling back due process rights for immigrants?

That’s one of the biggest debates, including what process is “due” in each case. President Donald Trump, along with top officials, has lamented judicial processes and rulings that have curbed the White House’s deportation push.

The United States has “some of the worst, most dangerous people on Earth,” Mr. Trump told NBC News in May. “I was elected to get them ... out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it.”

Many immigration lawyers disagree with his approach. “We are seeing the erosion of due process,” says Jenine Saleh, a managing attorney at Human Rights First. “It’s procedural suffocation masquerading as efficiency.”

The immigration court system is being “undermined” and is “lacking impartiality,” says Lory Rosenberg, a former appellate immigration judge who now mentors lawyers. For one, she says, the appellate board has adopted the Trump administration’s view that more respondents should be held in custody during immigration proceedings. She also disagrees with the administration’s narrowing of asylum eligibility in cases where a person says they’re fleeing domestic violence.

Other critics of the system, including supporters of the administration, argue that immigration courts contain too much red tape.

“Part of the reason why we have this massive backlog is because there is so much due process built into the system,” says Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies.

In most cases, the Department of Homeland Security has to receive a removal order issued by an immigration judge before it can deport anyone, says Mr. Arthur. But due to legal, logistical, and sometimes diplomatic complications, not everyone ordered removed is deported right away. As of mid-September, there were nearly 790,000 final orders of removal that the government could execute, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

What’s happening with the firing of immigration judges?

At the end of fiscal 2024, there were 735 immigration judges, according to the Justice Department. That number fell to 685 this past summer, the latest federal data available.

Now, the judges’ union says some 600 judges hold hearings. Under this administration, the union says 141 judges have departed because of firings, deferred resignation, or reassignment. The Justice Department on Oct. 24 announced a hiring boost of 36 judges that include several military officers.

The administration is training judge advocates general – military lawyers – to serve at least temporarily as immigration judges. Some concerned Democratic lawmakers say the move appears to violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

At the judges’ union, “We’re grateful for any help we can get” to lower the backlog, says the immigration judge. At the same time, there are readiness concerns, and the union has pushed for the military personnel to receive proper training.

The service members are an appropriate stopgap, but “not a long-term solution,” says Cully Stimson, a former top Navy judge and current senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation. The plan “takes away from our duties to the military,” he says, adding that immigration judges need the same procedural tools that other federal judges wield to reduce their caseload.

What reforms for the court have been proposed?

The National Association of Immigration Judges has called for creating an independent court system. So have immigrant advocates, who also push for increased access to counsel. Some Democrat-led states, including California and Colorado, have created legal defense funds for immigrants to help obtain that aid.

Congress could reduce the court backlog by granting legal status to certain unauthorized immigrants, though that’s “unlikely in today’s political climate,” says the Migration Policy Institute report. The think tank advocates prioritizing cases that present national-security or public-safety risks, and allowing immigration officers outside the court to decide more asylum cases.

At the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Stimson has called for expanding immigration judges’ powers with contempt authority and more ways to end cases at early stages. Project 2025, a road map for the presidency developed by the foundation, suggests moving the court to the Department of Homeland Security, treating the judges as national security personnel, and decertifying their union.

There are also loads of new cases, from a grandmother battling a 23 year old deportation order so that she can join her family in the UK, to some dodgy interviewing practices by the Home Office, unrepresented appellants and decisions on the papers, and Sonia and Barry do their usual scratching of heads over the Home Office’s decision to fight a fairly obvious case about an email all the way to the Court of Appeal.

According to HSPRD, Santillana Galeano was released from ICE detention in Clay County, Indiana on Wednesday night.

“We are thrilled that Ms. Santillana was released, and has been able to return home to Chicago where she belongs,” said attorney Charlie Wysong, who represents Santillana Galeano along with Ms. Naiara Testai at Hughes Socol Piers Resnick & Dym, Ltd. “We will continue to pursue her immigration claims to stay in the United States. We are grateful to her community for the outpouring of support over these difficult days, and ask that her privacy be respected while she rests and recovers from this ordeal.”

Last Wednesday, a SUV of federal agents followed Santillana Galeano’s vehicle to the day care, then proceeded to follow her into the building — where children were in attendance at the time.

Video from the scene captured two agents dragging the teacher from the day care, taking her into custody.

Santillana Galeano’s detainment sparked outrage amongst the community, parents and city leaders — many coming forward in support and to speak on her behalf.

“I am so grateful to everyone who has advocated on my behalf, and on behalf of the countless others who have experienced similar trauma over recent months in the Chicago area,” said Santillana Galeano. “I love our community and the children I teach, and I can’t wait to see them again.”

The changes will be based on Denmark and other European countries which have made it harder to claim asylum and easier to remove people.

Home Office sources told the Times ""excessive generosity and ease of remaining"" in the UK had combined with systemic barriers and made deportations extremely difficult.

The measures will come as the Home Office announced that nearly 50,000 illegal migrants have been removed or deported from British soil since Labour came to power.

New figures show a 23% increase in total removals or deportations compared to the previous 16-month period before July 2024 under the Conservatives.

It is understood many of the changes will be closely modelled on the policies of Denmark's centre-left Social Democrats, who have presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.

The party's reforms introduced in 2016 led to a 40-year low in asylum claims.

In Denmark refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to reapply for asylum when they expire.

Even for those who are allowed to extend multiple times, the route to citizenship has grown longer and harder.

Four years ago the Danish government planned to return around 200 refugees to Syria while the civil war raged because it said some parts of Damascus were safe.
