NBC10 Boston has reached out to Gov.","A federal official says that ICE has begun a new operation in Massachusetts targeting criminal immigrants in the country without documentation.

ICE, as the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is known, is conducting a follow-up to a surge in May it's called Operation Patriot 2.0, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is a part of, told NBC10 Boston on Saturday.

The May operation, Operation Patriot, resulted in nearly 1,500 people being arrested, officials said at the time.

In the new statement, the DHS spokesperson, who didn't give their name, referred to the initial operation as a success, and derided the so-called sanctuary policy of Boston and its mayor, Michelle Wu, as privileging criminals over U.S. citizens.

""Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,"" the statement said.

Wu has reiterated that its policies on immigrants -- limiting local officials' cooperation with deportation enforcement -- have made it among the country's safest cities, including in her response to a federal lawsuit filed this week over Boston's ""sanctuary"" law, the Boston Trust Act.

Wu released a statement to NBC10 Boston on Saturday night addressing the latest operation in the area, saying, ""For months, the Trump DOJ, DHS, and ICE have been spreading blatant lies and threatening to 'bring hell' to cities like Boston who refuse to bow down to their authoritarian agenda, so this unconstitutional attack is not a surprise.""

""This country was born facing down bullies, with Bostonians leading the way,"" Wu continued. ""Today Boston is the safest major city in the country because we have worked to build trust in the community, so that everyone feels safe seeking help or reporting a crime. We will not be bullied or intimidated into abandoning the efforts that make Boston a safe home for everyone.”

It wasn't immediately clear how many federal agents were taking part in Operation Patriot 2.0, or what Massachusetts communities the operation was being conducted in. The New York Times, citing sources, reported that the operation was expected to last several weeks; the DHS spokesperson's statement didn't address how long Patriot 2.0 would take.

ICE agents were seen in the town of Clinton on Friday morning.

Trump administration targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states.

Immigrants’ Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Although the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has accepted the audit office's recommendation for improvement, the environment of the facility is likely to have improved to some extent, local human rights groups have raised concerns since then.

Although the South Korean government is asking the U.S. for cooperation in resolving the situation and demanding prompt release, analysts say that prolonged detention could also raise concerns about deteriorating health.

On the 4th, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cracked down on illegal residents at a joint battery plant construction site between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution in Georgia. In the process, 475 people, including 300 Koreans, were reportedly arrested. Most of the South Koreans arrested are currently in a detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.

2021 Audit Office Points Out Leaks, Fungi, Worms, etc

The name of the detention facility is Processing Center. It is a place where ICE investigates the residence status and charges of arrested foreigners and detain them until they decide on a processing policy, including deportation.

In the past, the Folkston facility was pointed out for its poor environment during a random inspection by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) audit office.

According to the report released by the audit office in June 2022, the audit office identified a number of ""violations that undermine the health, safety and rights of prisoners"" in the inspection conducted from November 16-18, 2021.

The audit office pointed to ""torn mattresses, leaks, stagnant water, mold, old showers, mold and debris in ventilation systems, pervasive bugs, hot water-deficient showers, inoperable toilets, broken thermometers in kitchen freezers, and absence of warm meals.""

The audit office said, ""The medical staff at the facility did not provide special treatment or adequate mental health treatment for the inmate in a timely manner. Folkston did not respond in a timely or complete manner to the grievances or requests of the inmate,"" it said.

He also pointed out that he improperly handcuffed the inmate and did not properly manage the inmate's possessions.

Since then, the audit office has determined that ICE has mostly accepted the audit office's recommendations for improvement. As a result, the living environment of the facility seems to have improved to some extent, but local human rights organizations have raised concerns since then.

In 2024, there will be deaths of inmates

In April 2024, some pointed out that Jaspal Singh, an Indian national who was arrested while attempting to enter the country illegally, died after being imprisoned in Folkston, and that medical response may have been insufficient.

In a statement the day before, the Atlanta, Georgia-based human rights group Asian Americans for Justice (AAAJ) criticized ICE's crackdown on the construction site of the Hyundai Motor-LG Ensol plant, pointing out ""inhumane conditions and violations"" at the Folkston detention center.

The Folkestone Detention Center is owned and managed by private company GEO Group and has a capacity of about 1100.

ICE detention centers in the United States are generally known to have poor living conditions. According to a report released by the audit office in September 2024, the audit office surveyed 17 detention centers, including Folkston, between 2020 and 2023 and pointed out that they did not fully comply with DHS's own environmental health and safety standards.

The audit office said, ""As a result, it has undermined the ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for employees and inmates.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202509/07/news-p.v1.20250907.ae38c4add25d43c78bd5a1a0e79356ff_P1.png,N,,2025-09-06 19:56:42.260534

""If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the U.S., would anyone even ask this question?""
International law prohibits the deliberate killing of civilians, even in the context of an armed conflict.","Under intense pressure from Capitol Hill to provide a legal rationale for the unprecedented killing of 11 alleged drug smugglers by the U.S. military, the Trump administration has so far ducked lawmakers and provided a mishmash of public justifications that raise serious questions about the legality of the strike, legal experts and congressional sources say.The Defense Department on Friday abruptly canceled classified briefings it was set to provide in the morning to several key House and Senate committees, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. Lawmakers and staffers had hoped to ask officials questions about the legal justification for the strike, and even get basic details like which military unit conducted the attack, what type of munition was used, and the kind of intelligence gathering that went into determining the identities and intentions of those on the boat.Broadly, administration officials have sought to make the argument that the 11 people on a speedboat that the U.S. blew up in international waters in the Caribbean this week were legitimate military targets because they were members of a loosely organized Venezuelan criminal gang called Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization.""The strike was the obvious result of designating them a terrorist organization,"" said one person familiar with the Pentagon's thinking. ""If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the U.S., would anyone even ask this question?""But Congress in 2001 explicitly determined the U.S. to be at war with al Qaeda, officially stamping them as combatants who the U.S. is legally allowed to kill under both domestic and international law. It has not done so for Tren de Aragua. The designation of the group as a foreign terrorist organization — or FTO — under U.S. statute gives the president the authority to impose financial and legal penalties, like sanctions, but it does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force.The president has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to use military force when it is in the national interest, and when it does not amount to ""war"" in the constitutional sense, which requires an act of Congress. Past administrations have interpreted these standards fairly broadly — especially in the decadeslong war against al Qaeda, ISIS and other evolving Islamist terror groups — and Trump officials have also claimed the president was exercising his inherent Article II powers here.But again, legal experts say, there is a wrinkle: That amorphous power still requires that the president establish that its targets are legitimate military targets who should be treated as combatants under both international and domestic law. Cartel members and drug smugglers have traditionally been treated as criminals with due process rights — not enemy combatants — and the Trump administration has yet to offer a justification beyond the FTO defense that it is in a state of armed conflict with Tren de Aragua.Trump on Friday sent a letter to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Senate president pro tempore, formally notifying Congress of the strike, but offered little detail beyond a vague claim of his Article II authority, and in fact did not list Tren de Aragua by name as the target, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN. He said the military was ""postured to carry out further military operations,"" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials have indicated that they intend to do.Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that ""the strike was fully consistent with the law of armed conflict"" — suggesting that the administration wants wartime rules to apply to the group.""It's legal madlibs,"" said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues. ""They're throwing a lot of words out there that don't necessarily go together or constitute a coherent legal justification.""Few details on the deceased Even if the action taken against the 11 people in the boat did constitute a strike against a group with whom the U.S. was engaged in armed conflict, there are other legal questions and contradictions within the administration's public accounting of the episode.Finucane and others pointed to Rubio's admission that the boat could have been interdicted rather than destroyed — as has been done in the past — but that the president ordered a lethal strike as a matter of first, not last, resort.""That gives away the ballgame right there,"" said a former Pentagon lawyer who left the government in recent months. ""Any remotely plausible argument for inherent commander-in-chief authority to take military action would require showing there wasn't an alternative to lethal force.""Trump, in his letter to Congress, also claimed that the administration acted in self-defense because of ""the inability or unwillingness of some states in the region to address the continuing threat to United States persons and interests emanating from their territories"" — language that echoes some key justifications for the use of force under international law.But, the same former defense lawyer said, under the U.N. Charter establishing the international rules of war, to claim a defensive action, ""you have to establish it was necessary and proportionate.""""If you're admitting you could have just interdicted, how was blowing up necessary?"" this person said.And perhaps most importantly, experts and congressional aides said, the administration so far has provided few factual details about the 11 people on the boat that would support their assessment that they were a legitimate military target.Rubio and Trump offered conflicting assessments of where the boat was heading — Rubio initially said the alleged drugs on board were ""probably"" bound for Trinidad or another Caribbean country, while Trump said the vessel was headed to the U.S. Rubio later said the U.S. had intelligence the vessel ""was headed towards, eventually, the United States.""Although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that the government ""knew exactly who"" was on the boat and ""exactly what they were doing,"" and Trump has said the U.S. has ""tapes of them speaking,"" the government has not released the identities of any of the people killed. The military and the CIA have been criticized in the past for killings of civilians whom they believed were terrorists.International law prohibits the deliberate killing of civilians, even in the context of an armed conflict. Domestic law, meanwhile, prohibits unilateral and premeditated killings of non-military targets.""There is a word for the premeditated killing for people outside of context of armed conflict,"" Finucane said. ""That word is murder. The administration has not made the case U.S. is in armed conflict with TDA or made the case that they are governed by the law of war.""CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.CNN's Alayna Treene contributed to this report.

Under intense pressure from Capitol Hill to provide a legal rationale for the unprecedented killing of 11 alleged drug smugglers by the U.S. military, the Trump administration has so far ducked lawmakers and provided a mishmash of public justifications that raise serious questions about the legality of the strike, legal experts and congressional sources say.

Lawmakers and staffers had hoped to ask officials questions about the legal justification for the strike, and even get basic details like which military unit conducted the attack, what type of munition was used, and the kind of intelligence gathering that went into determining the identities and intentions of those on the boat.

Broadly, administration officials have sought to make the argument that the 11 people on a speedboat that the U.S. blew up in international waters in the Caribbean this week were legitimate military targets because they were members of a loosely organized Venezuelan criminal gang called Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization.

""The strike was the obvious result of designating them a terrorist organization,"" said one person familiar with the Pentagon's thinking. ""If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the U.S., would anyone even ask this question?""

But Congress in 2001 explicitly determined the U.S. to be at war with al Qaeda, officially stamping them as combatants who the U.S. is legally allowed to kill under both domestic and international law. It has not done so for Tren de Aragua.

The designation of the group as a foreign terrorist organization — or FTO — under U.S. statute gives the president the authority to impose financial and legal penalties, like sanctions, but it does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force.

The president has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to use military force when it is in the national interest, and when it does not amount to ""war"" in the constitutional sense, which requires an act of Congress.

Past administrations have interpreted these standards fairly broadly — especially in the decadeslong war against al Qaeda, ISIS and other evolving Islamist terror groups — and Trump officials have also claimed the president was exercising his inherent Article II powers here.

But again, legal experts say, there is a wrinkle: That amorphous power still requires that the president establish that its targets are legitimate military targets who should be treated as combatants under both international and domestic law.

Cartel members and drug smugglers have traditionally been treated as criminals with due process rights — not enemy combatants — and the Trump administration has yet to offer a justification beyond the FTO defense that it is in a state of armed conflict with Tren de Aragua.

Trump on Friday sent a letter to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Senate president pro tempore, formally notifying Congress of the strike, but offered little detail beyond a vague claim of his Article II authority, and in fact did not list Tren de Aragua by name as the target, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.

He said the military was ""postured to carry out further military operations,"" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials have indicated that they intend to do.

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that ""the strike was fully consistent with the law of armed conflict"" — suggesting that the administration wants wartime rules to apply to the group.

""It's legal madlibs,"" said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues. ""They're throwing a lot of words out there that don't necessarily go together or constitute a coherent legal justification.""

Few details on the deceased

Even if the action taken against the 11 people in the boat did constitute a strike against a group with whom the U.S. was engaged in armed conflict, there are other legal questions and contradictions within the administration's public accounting of the episode.

Finucane and others pointed to Rubio's admission that the boat could have been interdicted rather than destroyed — as has been done in the past — but that the president ordered a lethal strike as a matter of first, not last, resort.

""That gives away the ballgame right there,"" said a former Pentagon lawyer who left the government in recent months. ""Any remotely plausible argument for inherent commander-in-chief authority to take military action would require showing there wasn't an alternative to lethal force.""

Trump, in his letter to Congress, also claimed that the administration acted in self-defense because of ""the inability or unwillingness of some states in the region to address the continuing threat to United States persons and interests emanating from their territories"" — language that echoes some key justifications for the use of force under international law.

But, the same former defense lawyer said, under the U.N. Charter establishing the international rules of war, to claim a defensive action, ""you have to establish it was necessary and proportionate.""

""If you're admitting you could have just interdicted, how was blowing up necessary?"" this person said.

And perhaps most importantly, experts and congressional aides said, the administration so far has provided few factual details about the 11 people on the boat that would support their assessment that they were a legitimate military target.

Rubio and Trump offered conflicting assessments of where the boat was heading — Rubio initially said the alleged drugs on board were ""probably"" bound for Trinidad or another Caribbean country, while Trump said the vessel was headed to the U.S. Rubio later said the U.S. had intelligence the vessel ""was headed towards, eventually, the United States.""

Although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that the government ""knew exactly who"" was on the boat and ""exactly what they were doing,"" and Trump has said the U.S. has ""tapes of them speaking,"" the government has not released the identities of any of the people killed.

The military and the CIA have been criticized in the past for killings of civilians whom they believed were terrorists.

International law prohibits the deliberate killing of civilians, even in the context of an armed conflict. Domestic law, meanwhile, prohibits unilateral and premeditated killings of non-military targets.

""There is a word for the premeditated killing for people outside of context of armed conflict,"" Finucane said. ""That word is murder. The administration has not made the case U.S. is in armed conflict with TDA or made the case that they are governed by the law of war.""

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

Trump’s post comes as he ramps up federal enforcement in Chicago and the city prepares for anticipated increased operations by ICE.","As crowds celebrated the Mexican Independence Day parade in Pilsen and the city prepares for ramped-up immigration enforcement, President Donald Trump threatened Chicago in a post on social media Saturday, saying the city was about to find out “why it’s called the Department of War.”

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,’” he posted on Truth Social, a reference to the 1979 Vietnam War movie “Apocalypse Now” where Robert Duvall’s character Lt. Col. Kilgore says, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning.”

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of War,” the post continued, which included an image of Trump dressed in an Army uniform and helicopters flying in the background with the words “Chipocalypse Now.”

Trump signed an executive order Friday authorizing the Department of War as a secondary title for the Department of Defense in a move that he said sends “a message of strength.”

The White House shared the post on its X account.

Gov. JB Pritzker responded to Trump’s post Saturday on X, saying it “is not normal.”

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Pritzker said in the post.

“This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

Speaking at the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade in Pilsen on Saturday, Sen. Dick Durbin called Trump’s post “disgusting.” “To suggest that the troops are coming into Chicago is an embarrassment,” he said.

In an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Briefing With Jen Psaki” on Friday night, Pritzker said the federal government was “preparing to invade the communities around Chicago like Little Village, like Pilsen perhaps beginning early morning tomorrow.”

In a post on X, Mayor Brandon Johnson called on Chicagoans to protect each other amid the threats.

“The President’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,” Johnson said in the post. “We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Defending people is what brought Priscilla Read to the Pilsen parade on Saturday.

“We’re organizing to document detentions, report them, and do our best to defend people who are detained. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons we’re here today. Cameras at the ready. So far, there haven’t been any incidents, but [we are] prepared to document because that’s basically what we can do at this point,” said Read, 76.

“If you are defenders of democracy and human rights, you need to be in solidarity right now.”

Kenneth Morrison of Pilsen watched the parade go by as he sat outside Cafe Jumping Bean. “It’s disturbing that [Trump] wants to pick a fight.”

He said he thinks the posts will continue to fuel preconceived negative notions of Chicago.

People not living in Chicago “believe the narrative that Chicago is a hellhole. They don’t see anything like what we just saw a moment ago,” he said of the celebration at the parade.

“They just think we’re dodging bullets,” he added.

Trump’s post comes as he ramps up federal enforcement in Chicago and the city prepares for anticipated increased operations by ICE.

The New York Times reports that ICE officials have requisitioned thousands of handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, as well as a number of gas masks, license plate readers and buses in advance of the Chicago operation.

In his MSNBC interview, Pritzker said the Illinois State Police received a call from Gregory Bovino, a leader at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and ICE who is leading the planned deployment in Chicago, who said troops “are coming and that they intend to be in place by the end of this week.”

This week, Trump suggested that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard, in addition to sending troops to Chicago and Baltimore. He sent troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month and to Los Angeles following clashes between hundreds of protesters and federal immigration authorities in riot gear.

Demonstrators protested Saturday outside the Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago where hundreds of federal agents are being sent to carry out Trump’s mission to curb crime and make immigration arrests in Chicago.

Guwahati: BJP’s key ally in the NDA — Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) — on Saturday opposed the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order 2025 issued by the Union home ministry recently. In a news conference at the party headquarters, AGP vice-president Kumar Deepak Das said AGP would move the Supreme Court against the order, which he said violates the March 25, 1971, cut-off date endorsed by the Assam Accord for the detection and deportation of illegal migrants from Assam. Former AGP MP Kumar Dipak Das said, “The AGP has never compromised on the Assam Accord and will not do so.” Expressing dissatisfaction with the order that affects Assam and the northeast as well, the AGP clarified that despite being part of the NDA, it does not support this order that allows entry, stay, and exit of people of minority communities from neighbouring countries in India. Many organisations in Assam have viewed this order as an extension of the cut-off date of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act by 10 years. However, the AGP has not taken any decision to part ways with the NDA. “The AGP consistently opposed both the former CAB and the current CAA. Additionally, the AGP sought support from other national parties to oppose the CAA. The AGP challenged the CAA in the Supreme Court, saying that CAA cannot be implemented in Assam because, if implemented, it will violate the Assam Accord. It was due to the AGP’s petition that the SC ordered a separate hearing for Assam and the Northeast,” Das said. “Regarding the recent order, the AGP will once again file a petition in court challenging the recent directive,” he added. Das said the latest order has created a hurdle as far as the implementation of the Assam Accord is concerned. Considering the problems created by the home ministry’s order, the AGP, on Friday evening, convened a meeting of senior leaders where it was decided to move the SC against the order.

The new home secretary is reportedly set to announce the use of Ministry of Defence sites to house people after a wave of protests outside migrant accommodation over the summer.

The scale of the challenge facing the former justice secretary was illustrated on Saturday when an estimated 1,000 people arrived in the UK by small boats.

It comes after the prime minister carried out a major reshuffle including wide-ranging changes at the Home Office as he seeks to tighten his grip on immigration and draw a line under Angela Rayner’s resignation.

The chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, earlier denied that the government was in crisis and insisted Starmer now has the “strongest team” in place around the cabinet table following Rayner’s departure.

He ruled out the prospect of an early election amid opposition claims that the upheaval could open splits within Labour and collapse the prime minister’s authority.

Speaking to broadcasters on Saturday, Jones dismissed suggestions that the rejig could delay the Starmer’s self-described “phase two” of government by moving senior figures to unfamiliar briefs.

“It’s not instability insofar as the outcomes that we’re delivering are the same,” Jones, who is also the newly appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Breakfast.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d9f282c7de2a9b9f5ce7196323f48199b97110/1470_0_2083_1666/master/2083.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=abe6cbcca9362ebd8a4d278b51b8362a",N,,2025-09-06 18:56:48.756312

“While Americans were enjoying their Friday night, ICE was hard at work arresting criminal illegal aliens across the country including in Houston, New York City, Salt Lake City, San Diego, and Atlanta,” said a DHS Spokesperson. “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens.

Donggin Shin, 37, was apprehended by immigration authorities in a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado and placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. His father brought him to the U.S. from South Korea when he was a child and he lives in Salt Lake City, according to his attorney, Adam Crayk.

Shin, who goes by the name John, was held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado — more than 500 miles away from his home — according to an ICE database. He was released on $25,000 bond on Tuesday.

“I never thought I would have to feel what it’s like to be shackled on my ankles and my wrist, feeling like some kind of a serious criminal, as if I have murdered someone,” Shin said at a press conference Friday, according to KSL-TV, an NBC affiliate based in Salt Lake City.

“I was absolutely terrified. Obviously, I cried all day,” he added.

Shin was held for a total of 17 days and is now wearing an ankle monitor, according to Crayk.

Shin was identified by ICE’s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered national security threats, according to charging documents.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In response to previous questions about Shin, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News: “Our message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.”

The official added that Shin had a DUI conviction. Records show the matter was resolved after Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense in 2020 and served his probation.

Crayk, Shin’s attorney, told NBC New in a previous interview that his client’s father was battling brain cancer at the time of his prior arrest.

“My father was losing a battle to a Level 4 glioblastoma brain tumor. He had limited time to live,” Shin said, according to KSL-TV. “I fell into a depression during that time and the impaired driving followed.”

Shin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on Sept. 3, 1998, which “required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999,” according to DHS. But Crayk previously told NBC News that this timeline is incomplete, as Shin’s father switched to a student visa, which conferred status onto Shin at the time.

Crayk said Shin became a DACA recipient years later, but lost his DACA protections due to his 2020 conviction. He has remained without lawful status for the last four and a half years.

Shin works in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West in recent years.

Musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to raise awareness until Shin returns home.

Pritzker has blasted Trump for suggesting that major cities should be asking the federal government for assistance with law enforcement, citing dwindling crime statistics and calling the request “an insult.”","Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) lambasted President Trump on Saturday for joking about immigration enforcement efforts, including plans to target Chicago, calling the president a “wannabe dictator.”

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Pritzker wrote on social platform X in response to a meme shared by Trump. “This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

“Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man,” he added. “Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Trump earlier Saturday posted an image generated by artificial intelligence (AI) to his Truth Social platform that showed his likeness as a law enforcement official. The background includes an image of Chicago burning, several helicopters and text that reads “Chipocalypse Now” — a nod to the 1979 movie “Apocalypse Now.”

In the caption, the president wrote, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning… Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The comment comes just a day after he signed an executive order to rebrand the Defense Department to the Department of War.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) railed against the post in a Saturday social media post, stating it is “beneath the honor of our nation.”

“But the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,” Johnson wrote on X. “We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Trump late last month signaled his administration would look to the Windy City next in its efforts to tackle crime and illegal immigration. The White House already confirmed that is looking to use a Navy base near Chicago to support its migrant detention efforts.

The president has also threatened to deploy National Guard troops to the city, pointing to what he called success in his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., to aid in the expected crackdown. While his moves in the nation’s capital are protected under the federal district’s Home Rule Act, Illinois is a sovereign state.

Any effort to deploy troops to Chicago without the governor requesting assistance would likely result in a legal battle, like the one that played out in Los Angeles over deportation raids.

Local officials in The Prairie State have pushed back on the administration’s threat, suggesting Trump is overstepping his authority. Johnson signed a protective order late last month to combat the potential deployment of soldiers.

The city’s Office of Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee Rights also rolled out an updated website earlier this week with step-by-step guidance on how immigrants can protect themselves.

South Sudan thanked Mexico for its cooperation and said it had received assurances Munoz-Gutierrez would not be subjected to “torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, or undue prosecution upon his return”.

The statement said he had been treated with “full respect for his human dignity and fundamental rights” during his stay in the capital, Juba.

The repatriation was carried out “in full accordance with relevant international law, bilateral agreements, and established diplomatic protocols”, it added.

‘Felt kidnapped’

In comments to journalists in Juba, Munoz-Gutierrez said he “felt kidnapped” when the US sent him to South Sudan.

“I was not planning to come to South Sudan, but while I was here, they treated me well,” he said. “I finished my time in the United States, and they were supposed to return me to Mexico. Instead, they wrongfully sent me to South Sudan.”

The US Department of Homeland Security has said Munoz-Gutierrez had a conviction for second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.

South Sudan is discussing with other countries the repatriation of the six deportees still in its custody, said Apuk Ayuel Mayen, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry.

It is not clear if the deportees have access to legal representation. Only one of eight was from South Sudan.

Rights groups have argued that the Trump administration’s increasing practice of deporting migrants to third countries violates international law and the basic rights of migrants.

The deportations have faced opposition by courts in the US although the Supreme Court in June allowed the government to restart swift removals of migrants to countries other than their homelands.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, in a raid Thursday at a massive electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Ga., near Savannah. The plant is a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution.

ICE released video of what officials say is the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the Homeland Security Investigations. It shows officers shackling workers and loading them onto Georgia prison buses.

""This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans,"" said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations for Georgia and Alabama, during a news conference announcing the operation. ""We are sending a clear and unequivocal message that those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy and violate federal laws will be held accountable.""

He said it was not an operation where agents simply rounded up people and put them on buses, but the result of a months-long investigation. The workers, Schrank said, were either illegally present in the U.S. or working unlawfully.

The arrests add to tension with a key ally at a time when President Trump has been pushing for trade deals and more South Korean investment in the U.S. Hyundai also has an auto plant in Montgomery, Ala., and has announced plans to invest more than $5 billion in a steel plant in Louisiana.

""I would say that they were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job,"" Trump said when asked about the raid at the White House on Friday.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia says the raid raises questions about both the president's immigration strategy and how the firms were able to allegedly employ workers without proper documentation.

""Companies should not be able to get rich in Georgia by exploiting immigrant workers and putting them at risk of politically motivated raids and violations of due process,"" Warnock said in a statement. ""It's bad for our economy, bad for Georgia's workers, and bad for law-abiding Georgia families living in fear of this administration.""

Hyundai Motor Co. says it's working to understand the specific circumstances of the arrests.

""Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,"" the company said in a statement, promising an internal investigation into employment compliance.

""Hyundai has zero tolerance for those who don't follow the law,"" it said.

In a statement to Yonhap on Saturday, LG Energy Solution said it has suspended all business trips to the U.S. and told workers visiting the U.S. to stay in their accommodations or return to South Korea immediately. The company said its chief human resources officer is heading to the U.S. to address the issues on site.

""We will make every effort to promptly resolve the situation, including ensuring the speedy and safe return of all employees,"" LG Energy Solution said.

Brian Kemp has said it has provided ""historic benefits"" and new opportunities for workers. In a statement, a spokesperson for Kemp's office said: ""In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws"" and noted that the state Department of Public Safety coordinated with ICE to support the operation.

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.
The case has had numerous legal twists, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.
A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.","SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal protections that have granted more than 1 million people from Haiti and Venezuela the right to live and work in the United States.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco for the plaintiffs means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the U.S. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians.

Chen scolded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for revoking protections for Venezuelans and Haitians that the judge said would send them ""back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries.""

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.

Presidential administrations have executed the law for 35 years based on the best available information and in consultation with other agencies, ""a process that involves careful study and analysis. Until now,"" Chen wrote.

Plaintiffs and their attorneys welcomed the news Friday, although it's unclear if it would help people who have already been deported.

""In recent months, people have suffered unspeakable harm — including deportation and family separation — due to the Supreme Court greenlighting Secretary Noem's discriminatory and harmful agenda,"" said Emi Maclean, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California. ""That must end now.""

A DHS spokesperson said in an email that the program has been ""abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program"" and that ""unelected activist judges"" cannot stop the American people's desire for a secure country.

""While this order delays justice, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,"" the email read.

The second Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has resulted in ramped-up arrests of people in the country illegally, but also an end to programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in immigrants' homelands are deemed unsafe.

According to court documents, the administration has terminated Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and Humanitarian Parole designations for about 1.5 million people, prompting lawsuits across the country from immigrant advocates.

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States, if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.

Haiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.

Their designations were to expire in September but later extended until February, due to a separate court order out of New York.

Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the countries to stay on for what is a temporary program. Attorneys for the government have said the secretary's clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program are not subject to judicial review.

Designations are granted for terms of six, twelve or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.

The secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violated the law, Chen wrote.

The case has had numerous legal twists, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In March, Chen temporarily paused the administration's plans to end TPS for people from Venezuela. An estimated 350,000 Venezuelans were set to lose protections the following month.

But the U.S. Supreme Court in May reversed his order while the lawsuit played out. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals, and did not rule on the merits of the case.

Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.

A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.

After appearing for her annual immigration check-in, a restaurant hostess living in Indiana was deported back to Venezuela in July. Her husband, a construction company supervisor, cannot work and care for their baby daughter at the same time.

In June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states. He slept for about two weeks on a floor, terrified he would be sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. His wife cannot maintain the household on her earnings.

""I am not a criminal,"" he said in the declaration, adding that ""immigrants like myself come to the United States to work hard and contribute, and instead our families and lives are being torn apart.""

The Supreme Court's reversal does not apply to Friday's ruling. The government is expected to appeal.

Last week, a three-judge appeals panel also sided with plaintiffs, saying the Republican administration did not have the authority to vacate protection extensions granted by the previous administration.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7e09e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/792x416+0+54/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F11%2F41%2Fa650eb4247b6871e958ecad5b824%2Fkristi-noem.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 18:56:44.661912

US officials detained 475 people - mostly South Korean nationals - who they said were found to be illegally working at the battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in the state.

The White House defended the operation, dismissing concerns that the raid could deter foreign investment.

South Korea, a close US ally, has pledged tens of billions of dollars in American manufacturing investment, partly to offset tariffs.

The timing of the raid, as the two governments engage in sensitive trade talks, has raised concern in Seoul.

Trump has actively encouraged major investments from other countries while also tightening visa allocations for foreign companies.

Many of the LG employees arrested were on business trips with various visas or under a visa waiver programme, officials say.

South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Hyun said he felt a ""great sense of responsibility for the arrest of our citizens"" as he presided over an emergency meeting about the issue on Saturday.

He said the government had set up an Overseas Korean Protection Task Force to respond to the arrests and that he may travel to Washington if needed.

""Immediately after this incident became known, the President stressed that U.S. law enforcement actions must not unjustly infringe upon the rights of our nationals or the economic activities of our Korean-invested companies,"" he said.

On Saturday, LG Energy Solution announced it was sending its Chief Human Resources Officer Kim Ki-soo to the Georgia site on Sunday.

""We are making all-out efforts to secure the swift release of detained individuals from our company and partner firms,"" it said in a statement.

""We are confirming regular medications for families through an emergency contact network for detainees and plan to request that necessary medications be delivered to those detained.""

A lifeline There were about 605,000 Venezuelans and 331,000 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status as of March 31, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service.","A federal judge ruled Friday that the Trump administration cannot strip the deportation protections under Temporary Protected Status for nearly 1 million Venezuelans and Haitians already in the United States, many of them living in South Florida.

In a 69-page ruling, Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California characterized the decision of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to end TPS for Haiti and Venezuela as capricious, arbitrary and beyond the scope of her authority.

“The Secretary’s actions in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law,” Chen wrote on Friday.

Chen restored a Biden-era TPS extension that runs until October 2026 for Venezuelans and February 2026 for Haitians. The Department of Homeland Security in July had already begrudgingly agreed to keep that expiration date for Haiti after a separate federal ruling from New York.

The ruling is a long-awaited relief for over 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, whose immigration protections hinged on Chen. On Friday, advocates and immigrants went to celebrate at El Arepazo restaurant in Doral, where Venezuelans have long-gathered to commemorate community milestones.

Cecilia González Herrera, the only plaintiff who lives in Florida, told the Herald over text that the judge’s order was a “tremendous victory.” The University of Central Florida student came to the United States eight years ago, fleeing with her parents because they were involved in anti-government movements.

“Judge Chen’s decision is a reminder that the institutions of this country are stronger than any political agenda. This ruling recognizes both the legality and the humanity of TPS. The road ahead is long, but today we are reminded that justice prevails,” said the 26-year-old Kissimmee woman.

Chen said Friday that Noem’s move to roll back the Biden-era extensions was “extraordinary and unusual.” He noted in his decision that it was the first time such an action had happened since Congress made the program into a law in 1990.

“We celebrate today that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans can sleep more peacefully today. We celebrate that due process and justice still exist in this country ... We are very grateful to this country and its justice system. Today is a great day and we will honor it by being the best citizens we can be,” said Adelys Ferro, Miami-based director of the national organization Venezuelan-American Caucus.

“An existential crisis”

The federal government can grant Temporary Protected Status to immigrants who cannot safely return to their home countries because of war, natural disasters and other devastating circumstances.

President Joe Biden first granted Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans in 2021, citing repressive governance, food insecurity, human rights violations, acute poverty, crumbling infrastructure and insufficient healthcare. Two years later, he expanded the protections so recently arrived Venezuelans could benefit, making it the nationality with the largest pool of beneficiaries.

Separately, Biden thrice designated Haiti for Temporary Protected Status in the aftermath of the murder of President Jovenel Moise, a devastating earthquake, mass internal displacement, widespread gang violence, chronic hunger and extreme impoverishment.

But since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has ended Temporary Protected Status protections for immigrants from Haiti, Venezuela and several other countries — which he previously attempted during his first term. In February, the Trump administration ended the 2023 protections for about 352,000 Venezuelans. This week, it announced protections granted in 2021 would expire for another 250,000 people from the South American country on Sept. 10.

In the termination notice, the Department of Homeland Security argued that there had been notable improvements — including in public health, the economy and crime — that made it safe to go back to Venezuela. However, the agency said, the termination was required regardless of conditions because the TPS designation was against national interests.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal Chen’s decision, part of a lawsuit the National TPS Alliance filed in San Francisco. The federal government had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the spring. In May, the Justices gave Homeland Security the green light to end the program. That left the vast majority of Venezuelans under the 2023 TPS designation without the protections, despite a preliminary order for Chen keeping them in place. However, the nation’s highest court has not weighed on the merits of the case. An appeals court in California also recently affirmed a preliminary order on Chen’s original decision.

In his ruling, Chen noted that the government had not submitted any evidence documenting the improvements in Venezuela’s case, or conducted any meaningful review of how Venezuela was doing before ending the protections. “The draft of the termination decision was being prepared before any country condition analysis was conducted,” wrote Chen.

Chen also denied the Trump administration’s motion to throw out the lawsuit and dismissed its claims that Biden Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas had improperly extended Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status.

A lifeline

There were about 605,000 Venezuelans and 331,000 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status as of March 31, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service. Florida is the state by far with the biggest population of TPS holders, with 403,965 beneficiaries living there. Nearly all are Haitian or Venezuelan.

José Abinazar, a 26-year-old living in South Florida, expressed hope for the future in the wake of Judge Chen’s decision.

“This ruling brings peace of mind knowing that I can continue working and supporting my family,” he said. “Returning to Venezuela is neither viable nor safe.”

The licensed engineer came to the United States as a minor, where he has built a life rooted in public service. He graduated from Florida International University’s Honors College and now works on vital infrastructure projects that enhance community safety and climate resilience, including Miami-Dade County’s Stormwater Master Plan. He is also active in industry groups that promote professional development, environmental health and social advocacy.

“The work we do is essential for protecting our communities and preparing for the future,” he said, emphasizing that highly-specialized professionals working on critical issues like climate change like him are facing the threat of deportation under Trump administration policies. TPS “ensures I can keep working.”

For Mariana Molero and her husband, who have resided in the United States for two decades, Chen’s ruling extends beyond a legal formality. It’s how they can stay in the United States with their American-born teenagers, who have never been to Venezuela, without fearing family separation.

“It’s a joy, not only for me and my husband, but for my close relatives and for the whole community,” Molero, who lives with her family in Kissimmee, said. “We will be able to have an instrument in our hands that protects us.”

Molero and her husband arrived in the United States in 2003, fleeing after they were persecuted for working alongside opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa. Molero and her husband have remained active in the Venezuelan diaspora and denouncing human rights abuses in their home country. ” For Molero and her husband, returning to Venezuela could be not just a return to a homeland in trouble, but a danger to their lives.

“I have no doubt the regime would want to retaliate, even through physical persecution or forced disappearances. Our activism has been extensive,” she said. “Going back would expose us directly to reprisals.”

Despite the political persecution they faced in Venezuela for their activism, their asylum cases were denied. They have been under deportation orders since 2011. Chen’s decision allows them to continue their American life, alongside their children a little longer.

Although Abrego Garcia immigrated to the U.S. illegally around 2011 as a teenager, he has an American wife and child.
Though that court case is ongoing, ICE now seeks to deport him again.
Abrego Garcia, who denies the charges, is requesting asylum in the United States.
“If Mr. Abrego Garcia is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there’s no way he’s not going to prevail on his claim,” he said in an emailed statement.","Attorneys for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a Friday letter that they intend to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the African nation of Eswatini after he expressed a fear of deportation to Uganda.

The letter from ICE to Abrego Garcia’s attorneys was earlier reported by Fox News. It states that his fear of persecution or torture in Uganda is “hard to take seriously, especially given that you have claimed (through your attorneys) that you fear persecution or torture in at least 22 different countries. ... Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini.”

Human rights groups have documented violations and abuses in Uganda — as well as in Eswatini, a tiny African kingdom formerly known as Swaziland.

Eswatini’s government spokesperson told the Associated Press on Saturday that it had received no communication regarding Abrego Garcia’s transfer there.

The Salvadoran man lived in Maryland for more than a decade before he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year. That set off a series of contentious court battles that have turned his case into a test of the limits of President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies.

Although Abrego Garcia immigrated to the U.S. illegally around 2011 as a teenager, he has an American wife and child. A 2019 immigration court order barred his deportation to his native El Salvador, finding he had a credible fear of threats from gangs there. He was deported anyway in March — in what a government attorney said was an administrative error — and held in the country’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration returned him to the U.S. in June only to charge him with human smuggling based on a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Though that court case is ongoing, ICE now seeks to deport him again. Abrego Garcia, who denies the charges, is requesting asylum in the United States.

He was denied asylum in 2019 because his request came more than a year after he arrived in the U.S., his attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosenberg has said. Since he was deported and has now reentered the U.S., the attorney said, he is now eligible for asylum.

“If Mr. Abrego Garcia is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there’s no way he’s not going to prevail on his claim,” he said in an emailed statement.

As part of his asylum claim, Abrego Garcia expressed a fear of deportation to Uganda and “nearly two dozen” other countries, according to an ICE court filing in opposition to reopening his asylum case. That Thursday filing also states that if the case is reopened, the 2019 order barring his deportation to El Salvador would become void and the government would pursue his removal to that country.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5e3d14/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2Fbd%2F17ff4c83427ab20862040761bef4%2F07158ac2c45947348013738fd52ac134.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 14:56:50.764606

“The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America — they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,” Bondi said in the statement.
Boston isn't the first major city Bondi has sued over immigration policy.
While the DOJ suit claims Boston's policy impedes federal immigration enforcement, Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director and former Boston ICE chief, recently boasted that he routinely gets tips from local police.
And in March, Wu was summoned to Washington to answer question on the city's cooperation with immigration enforcement officials before a Republican-controlled House committee.","The Trump administration filed a lawsuit against Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Police Department, saying the city's policy to cooperate with immigration enforcement officials only in criminal matters violates federal law.

The suit, filed Thursday in federal court in Boston, takes aim at the city's Trust Act, the 2014 legislation that said Boston Police will not honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals unless they face criminal charges.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called out Wu specifically in her press release announcing the lawsuit.

“The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America — they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,” Bondi said in the statement. “If Boston won’t protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.”

The mayor hit back at the Trump administration in a statement Thursday night, saying, “This unconstitutional attack on our city is not a surprise.”

Wu defended Boston as “a thriving community, the economic and cultural hub of New England, and the safest major city in the country,” and said, “this administration is intent on attacking our community to advance their own authoritarian agenda.”

Wu said Boston will “vigorously defend our laws and the constitutional rights of cities, which have been repeatedly upheld in courts across the country. We will not yield.”

The simmering threat of a DOJ lawsuit became more real last month, when Bondi send demand letters to Boston and 31 other cities and states, ordering them to expand cooperation with immigration enforcement as the administration pursues mass deportations or risk losing federal funding.

The DOJ suit alleges that Boston's Trust Act puts federal law enforcement agents in danger ""by mandating restrictions on basic information sharing"" and barring the Department of Homeland Security access to people released from Boston police custody. The suit echoes a complaint of ICE officials in Massachusetts and Washington that they must engage in ""difficult and dangerous efforts"" to arrest immigrants in neighborhoods and courthouses because local officials won't turn people over who've been released on other charges.

Boston isn't the first major city Bondi has sued over immigration policy. Both New York and Los Angeles have been called to court over their own regulations.

The Trust Act was revised in 2019 and reaffirmed in 2024. Nowhere in the act is the word ""sanctuary"" used; the Trump administration has adopted the term as a catch-all phrase for cities that don't actively assist ICE in civil immigration arrests.

While the DOJ suit claims Boston's policy impedes federal immigration enforcement, Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director and former Boston ICE chief, recently boasted that he routinely gets tips from local police.

""I have so many friends — Boston police officers, Massachusetts state troopers — who are ecstatic about what we're doing, who give us intel,"" Lyons said on the Howie Carr show last month.

Wu rejected that claim this week, telling WBUR there was no evidence Boston cops are sharing information with ICE or any other agency beyond what is permitted in the Trust Act. She also vehemently denied repeated claims by the administration that the city is harboring criminals.

""Any assertion that we're protecting or shielding criminal behavior is absolutely false,"" Wu said.

The governor offered no immediate comment on the lawsuit. State Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement said, “This baseless lawsuit is yet another desperate attempt to rope local governments into helping the Trump Administration conduct their cruel immigration crackdowns, including targeting those with no criminal record."" She said she would ""continue to support the City of Boston in defending against these attacks on our residents.”

Josh Kraft, who’s running for mayor against Wu, in a statement called it ""yet another attempt by the Trump administration to undermine the laws and values of the City of Boston and what our nation was founded on.”

He noted that courts have so far “shut down the use of the National Guard in American cities and Boston must stand in defense of our laws and communities while continuing to work with law enforcement to keep all of our residents safe.”

At a Boston City Council hearing in the South End on Thursday night, Councilor Julia Mejia told WBUR the Trump administration ""should be focusing on the economy and they should be focusing on taking care of other business — and stay out of Boston.""

And U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren condemned the lawsuit and what she described as Trump's latest power grab.

""Boston doesn't back down to bullies. Boston is one of the safest major cities in America thanks to Mayor Wu's leadership and the trust between residents and public safety officials,"" she said in a statement.

The city's policy has been a routine target of Trump administration ire since the start of the president's second term in January, with officials asserting without evidence that the regulation shields criminals from the law. In February, Trump's border czar threatened to bring ""hell"" to Boston. And in March, Wu was summoned to Washington to answer question on the city's cooperation with immigration enforcement officials before a Republican-controlled House committee. She, alongside other big-city mayors, answered hours of grilling from the panel.

""Our local community knows best,” she said of the Trust Act during the hearing. “And we can tell you in Boston, over our history, it has not been the word of presidents, or kings, or presidents who think they are kings that set what happens. It is our residents.”

The Arizona-based Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, known as FIRRP, on Friday added Honduran children to a lawsuit filed last weekend that resulted in a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of dozens of migrant children to their native Guatemala.

In a statement, the organization said it had received reports that the U.S. government will “imminently move forward with a plan to illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

FIRRP did not immediately provide the Associated Press with details about what information it had received about the possible deportation of Honduran children. The amendment to the organization’s lawsuit is sealed in federal court. The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to email requests for comment Friday and Saturday.

Over Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration attempted to remove Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in shelters or with foster care families in the U.S.

Advocates who represent migrant children in court filed lawsuits across the country seeking to stop the government from removing the children, and on Sunday a federal judge stepped in to order that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July’s arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the suit was initially filed last week.

Some children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their legal right to present their cases to an immigration judge, have access to legal counsel and be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/98c8d39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5235x2748+0+371/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fd1%2F0fd262d747ca975b634a581a1059%2F7d734ed1f67641b1afd2e80360a1d6d5.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 13:57:21.728747

According to reporting from the HuffPost, since Trump took office, nearly 150,000 federal workers have been laid off.
“Our lawyers have the power to support federal workers and protect the stability and integrity of federal institutions,” Chu said.
But federal judges have already blocked the Trump administration from laying off federal workers, citing a number of legal reasons.","Now, public sentiment may be catching up.

A July 11 Forbes/IPSOS poll found that 62% of Americans disapprove of current immigration policies, including 65% of independents and nearly a third of Republicans.

While many still support border enforcement, the poll shows growing discomfort with workplace raids and family detentions. More than half now say immigrants strengthen the country, a notable shift from views during Trump's first term. The data suggests Americans increasingly favor reform that balances security with fairness.

This article builds on three economic arguments that together offer a roadmap for understanding and acting on this moment of clarity.

Three Economic Arguments for Immigration Reform

The case for immigration rests on three economic fundamentals that polling suggests Americans increasingly understand:

Demographics: America's aging population and below-replacement birthrates mean immigration is the only reason the U.S. workforce continues growing, and population growth is essential for sustained economic vitality. Countries like China and Russia are already in steep demographic decline.

Essential workforce: Immigrants work in key sectors the country depends on—agriculture, elder care, construction, logistics—often while facing deportation or legal limbo.

Fiscal impact: Millions of immigrants pay into Social Security and Medicare but are ineligible for benefits, helping stabilize programs that would otherwise face insolvency sooner. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, undocumented workers contributed $25 billion to Social Security in 2022 despite being ineligible for benefits unless they gain legal status.

Together, these factors show immigration as a primary engine sustaining U.S. population growth, the uncredited stabilizer of Social Security, and the invisible backbone of entire sectors from elder care to construction. What once seemed like long-term concerns now read as an immediate policy blueprint that the public may be ready to support.

Addressing the Fairness Concern

A fundamental question lies at the heart of the immigration debate. Millions have entered or remained in the U.S. without legal status, a civil violation. At the same time, others have waited for years, following the rules. What does fairness look like? Any serious conversation about reform must grapple with that tension, not to dismiss it, but to resolve it in a way that strengthens both the rule of law and the national interest.

That reform must acknowledge this concern directly. The current system has created two groups waiting for the same outcome through different paths. Some have waited years in their home countries for legal visas. Others have waited years inside the United States without legal status. Both deserve recognition, but neither should be punished for decades of system failures.

Legal recognition for undocumented immigrants cannot be automatic. It should require meeting specific conditions over multiple years: continuous employment or education enrollment, payment of back taxes and ongoing obligations, English language progress, established community ties, and a clean criminal record. Status would remain provisional with regular check-ins and possible revocation for non-compliance.

Meanwhile, the legal immigration system must function properly. Families are separated and employers are underserved because of outdated visa caps, bureaucratic delays, and inconsistent processing caused by congressional inaction and administrative neglect.

The alternative to comprehensive reform is continued dysfunction. Mass deportation would be economically damaging, socially destabilizing, and unlikely to succeed at scale. A reformed system addressing both legal and undocumented populations simultaneously may not satisfy every camp. Still, it's the only path that strengthens the rule of law, serves the national interest, and treats people with dignity.

Building Bipartisan Momentum

The polling shift creates an opening for cross-party action that hasn't existed in years. With 65 percent of independents and nearly a third of Republicans disapproving of current policies, multiple constituencies offer paths forward.

The business community provides the clearest opportunity. Chamber of Commerce groups in red states advocate for expanded guest worker programs. Texas, Florida, and Georgia business leaders voice concerns about labor shortages threatening operations. Fiscal conservatives find appeal in the Social Security angle—immigrants paying into a system they cannot access represents deficit reduction without new taxes. Local Republican officials, from mayors to county commissioners, face practical workforce shortage impacts and cannot afford to lose tax revenue.

History shows comprehensive immigration reform can be bipartisan with serious leadership. The 2013 ""Gang of Eight"" bill passed the Senate with Republican support. Reagan's 1986 reform had broad backing because business interests lobbied for steady labor flows. The difference was presidential leadership treating immigration as a national asset rather than a partisan wedge.

What a Realistic Reform Agenda Looks Like

If the public is ready to move beyond slogans and toward real solutions, Congress should pursue comprehensive legislation that includes:

Expand legal pathways for essential workers. Create new visa categories that reflect actual labor demand in caregiving, construction, agriculture, logistics, and infrastructure. These should include both temporary and permanent options, with clear pathways between them based on employer needs and worker qualifications.

Establish earned legal recognition with firm requirements. Undocumented individuals who have been in the U.S. for more than two years would be eligible to apply for provisional status after passing background checks and meeting employment, tax, and English language requirements. This status would last five years, with the possibility of renewal based on continued compliance. After a set number of years of provisional status, individuals could apply for permanent residence.

Modernize the legal immigration system. Recapture unused visas from previous years, increase annual caps to reflect economic needs, reduce processing times through technology upgrades, and create predictable timelines for all applicants. The goal should be to process most applications within 12 months, rather than the current multi-year delays.

Invest in integration support. Provide English language classes, job training, and credential recognition programs through partnerships with community colleges, unions, and employers. These programs should be funded through fees paid by participants and employers, making them self-sustaining while ensuring immigrants can contribute fully to their communities.

From Public Mood to Policy Design

The polling cited in Forbes may reflect growing public understanding that immigration, managed responsibly, strengthens America rather than weakening it. People are looking for practical solutions that address legitimate concerns while taking into account economic realities.

This represents a significant shift from the political environment of even six months ago. The challenge now is translating possible public readiness into policy action. That requires leadership that treats immigration as a national asset rather than a partisan wedge issue.

Even Ronald Reagan, in his final year in office, referred to immigration as ""a source of renewal."" The economic case for that view has only grown stronger. The underlying mathematics of demographics and fiscal policy remain the same, but the public mood has shifted.

What You Can Do Next

Public support is moving. The facts are clear. But the system will not change without sustained pressure, conversation, and leadership from every level of government and civil society.

Rather than tackling these complex issues individually, consider supporting organizations already working on comprehensive immigration reform:

Support advocacy organizations working on immigration policy reform, such as the American Immigration Council, New American Economy, or FWD.us, which focus on economic arguments and bipartisan solutions.

Engage business coalitions, such as local Chambers of Commerce, that advocate for expanded guest worker programs and address labor shortages in your region.

Connect with faith-based organizations that support immigration reform and have established networks for effective advocacy.

Contact your representatives to express support for comprehensive immigration reform, emphasizing the economic consequences of inaction rather than just moral arguments.

Stay informed and share fact-based analysis with your networks when immigration comes up in conversation.

The current moment represents a rare convergence of public opinion, economic necessity, and political opportunity. Missing this chance means accepting continued dysfunction in a system that affects every aspect of American economic life.

We have an opportunity to lead rather than simply manage a crisis. If we fail to act, history will note the silence that followed this clear public signal for change.

“We The Action is committed to expanding access to justice and delivering free legal services where they are critically needed,” Chu said.

We The Action’s website also states that they believe lawyers have the power to “do good” because of their ability to defend the nation’s values in the court of law.

Deportations or lay offs typically fall under civil legal problems, meaning they typically do not involve criminal charges but still have consequences. According to The Hague Institute for Innovation of Law, Americans have more than 150 million new civil legal problems every year, with 120 million of these going unaddressed. Other research also shows that only 14 percent of civil justice problems are taken to court or a hearing body.

Also, per the Legal Services Corporation, Americans with low income receive no or “inadequate” legal help in 92 percent of all legal problems.

Chu said We The Action works to support immigrant communities, like people seeking asylum like asylums or refugees, by finding nonprofits “defending” immigrant communities. She added that lawyers help people with the immigration system, reuniting families, and more.

One way that lawyers are connected with immigrant communities is through postings on We The Action’s website under the immigration section. Currently, postings include one from Hands United—which works to decrease the prevalence of language deprivation among hard-of-hearing children in immigrant families—for helping a Colombian family with a deaf child “fight” for asylum. Another post, by the Asian Women’s Shelter, which supports survivors of domestic violence and oppression in Asian and other communities, calls for California-based divorce and family attorneys. There is also a space on the website to get updates on future postings.

“We are facing unprecedented attacks on the rule of law,” Chu said. “And despite the uncertainty this brings, We The Action’s community of lawyers are poised to meet the moment.”

Under the first Trump administration, America saw the lowest number of migrants come to approximately 411,000. When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, immigration reached its highest in the 2000s at approximately 3.3 million in 2023. Since Trump has taken office again, immigration has dropped to approximately two million as of April 2025, according to The Brookings Institution.

Within Trump’s first week of office, he increased the number of active duty troops to the southern United States border by 1,500, for a total of 4,000 troops—a 60 percent increase. Through an executive order, he also halted the processing of all undocumented migrants and asylum seekers into the U.S., among other actions.

According to the Pew Research Center, 32 percent of Americans think all immigrants illegally in the country should be deported. This is compared to 51 percent, who stated that some should be deported. And 97 percent of those individuals said someone should be deported if they previously committed a violent crime.

Chu added that with these ""unprecedented threats,” We The Action launched the Immigration Legal Response Center for volunteer lawyers to protect immigrant communities under threat.

We The Action is also supporting federal workers who have been laid off under the Trump administration’s policies. In 2025, Chu said that We The Action partnered with the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, the American Constitution Society, Democracy Forward, the Partnership for Public Service, and others to launch Rise Up: Federal Workers Legal Defense Network and connect federal workers with critical legal resources.

Rise Up gives those laid off access to free initial legal consultations with federal workers recently laid off. It also allows lawyers to sign up to volunteer and help laid-off federal workers.

According to reporting from the HuffPost, since Trump took office, nearly 150,000 federal workers have been laid off. Trump’s administration also established the Department of Government Efficiency, whose objective is to cut excess regulation and spending, modernize technology, and maximize productivity.

The LA Times also reports that the civil service system, which We The Action assists, was not set up to deal with all these layoffs in a short period of time.

“Our lawyers have the power to support federal workers and protect the stability and integrity of federal institutions,” Chu said.

But federal judges have already blocked the Trump administration from laying off federal workers, citing a number of legal reasons. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with its plan to lay off federal workers from more than 20 different agencies.

Illston wrote in her ruling that presidents do not have the authority to change federal agencies unless they have obtained approval from Congress. She also added that nine presidents over the last century have changed federal agencies only after getting approval.

Besides assisting in federal layoffs, Chu also said that We The Action advances racial justice and protects voting rights in a number of ways. Looking forward, Chu said they will continue their mission.

“We will continue to meet the moment by expanding our technology and platform, meeting needs of vulnerable communities, protecting the rule of law, and defending democracy,” Chu said.

Grainy footage of handcuffed immigrants. Soft-focus, slow-motion portraits of agents. Menacing intonations about an invasion that must be stopped at all costs. Repeated declarations of going after the “worst of the worst,” even if they’re mostly — and very clearly— not.

But ICE has now entered the cops-poaching part of their deport-a-thon.

And the latest migra ad befouling L.A.-area television stations is the most pathetic — and chilling — one yet.

“Attention law enforcement” a robotic voice announces over an opening scene of a flashing siren in what looks like a tough part of an unidentified city. The camera cuts to a blue-tinted law enforcement badge as the words, “You took an oath to protect and serve” flash on the screen. The deep-toned announcer repeats the words.

Over 30 seconds, ICE claims “dangerous illegals walk free” in cities due to sanctuary policies not allowing police and sheriff’s departments to go after them. But if you join la migra, the commercial asserts, cops can finally “catch the worst of the worst” and “join the mission to protect America.” Promises — a $50,000 signing bonus, the forgiving of student loans and “generous” benefits — pile on top of each other toward the end of the ad with a plug for ICE’s website.

“Fulfill your mission,” it concludes, Terminator-like.

Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when ... they stop coming for you — because cops decide they’re going to start chasing after a tamale lady or a gardener with three sons in the U.S. Marines.

The commercial pushes the Trumpian idea that undocumented immigrants are the ne plus ultra of criminality in this country, even though study after study over decades have shown that they’re less likely to commit crimes than American citizens. It absurdly implies that arresting actual criminals — being in this country illegally is generally a civil matter — isn’t enough for local law enforcement to consider themselves true defenders of public safety. And it suggests that ICE is the only government agency that truly lives up to the oath to protect and serve Americans.

(Insert, “Sure, Jan” GIF here.)

Tinseltown has made many great films about the exploits of cops: “L.A Confidential,” “Heat,” “Serpico,” “Training Day,” just to name a few.

But I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie where some “loose cannon” cop pops out of a Penske rental truck to grab a “bad hombre” outside Home Depot trying to make a few bucks roofing your house.

Hint to Hollywood: There’s this fella named Dean Cain just ready to be cast in that role.

ICE didn’t respond to my multiple questions about its commercial — where it’s airing, how much is it costing taxpayers and why they made an ad specifically tailored to law enforcement in the first place. The campaign launched in mid-August across the U.S. but got my attention only last week, when it began to air seemingly every hour during KCAL Channel 9’s three-hour evening news block.

La migra has been trying to hire anyone with a pulse to join them ever since Trump’s Big Bloated Bill allocated an extra $170 billion in immigration enforcement spending over the next decade. Recruitment fairs are traveling the country like some xenophobic Lollapalooza in the quest to hire 10,000 agents — they’ll be offering jobs to an army of Roombas next.

ICE’s attempted nabbing of police and sheriff’s departments for their staff isn’t making local law enforcement leaders happy.

In August, USA Today reported that ICE sent an email solicitation to deputies nationwide, leading the head of the National Sheriff’s Assn. to call the move “either galactically stupid or purposefully malicious.”

Deputy Tony Meraz, a director for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, didn’t get that email but saw ICE’s commercial on YouTube and a similarly themed billboard. He hasn’t heard of any colleagues raring to go after taqueros and flower ladies but worries that la migra’s pitch “is going to shrink our applicant pool. If it somehow seems like local law enforcement is being federalized, [being a local officer] might not attract people who might want to serve in their local community.

“I don’t want to make it political,” Meraz added, “but if [the White House] can put commercials for federal law enforcement, maybe they can subsidize local law enforcement with our hiring and recruitment and retention issues.”

That’s the underlying evil of ICE’s “Attention law enforcement” ad. Donald Trump claims he loves them — but allowing la migra try to woo cops at a time where many departments face staffing shortages makes neighborhoods more dangerous, not less. That seems no concern to Trump, who’s continuing his scheme to transform every sector of American life charged with protecting this country into a deportation machine — or else.

Take a federal judge’s recent decision deeming that Trump’s National Guard invasion of L.A. this summer was illegal and a seeming prelude to creating a “national police force.” As reported by my fellow columnista Anita Chabria, buried in the 52-page ruling was a reference to sworn testimony by the man who headed that deployment, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman. He replied “yes” when asked if U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino questioned his “loyalty to the country” after Sherman initially hesitated about leading a temporary occupation of MacArthur Park in July because it would cause chaos.

The man who ultimately approved the show of farce was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who also ordered hundreds of Marines to occupy parts of L.A. in the wake of anti-migra protests. He recently accepted a Justice Department request to send up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges. They’re supposed to expedite the deportation of the tens of thousands of people currently in detention camps and go through millions of backlogged cases even though few of them have experience with immigration law.

I’m telling you, the Trump administration would poach Lionel Hutz from “The Simpsons” for its lawyer ranks if it helped them catapult more immigrants out of the country.

Legal experts told Anita that the move possibly runs afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from taking on domestic and immigration law enforcement. But it’s never about due process for Trump. It’s about dominion, damn the Constitution.

Trump and his masked goons claim all they want to do with their deportation deluge is to make communities safer. The irony of ICE’s cop commercial airing in Los Angeles is that if there’s a city that knows terrorizing undocumented immigrants doesn’t help to stop crime, it’s Los Angeles.

In 1979, the LAPD implemented Special Order 40, a directive that prevented officers from asking people about their immigration status in order to foster better relations with residents in the name of fighting crime. The chief who implemented it? That legendary hippie, Daryl Gates.

Special Order 40 is still in effect 46 years later and has never faced a significant internal or external revolt. Police Chief Jim McDonnell has repeatedly stressed his department wants nothing to do with playing migra even as critics point out that ICE has identified and deported people by using fingerprints that the LAPD uploads to a national database.

If law enforcement in a city with a significant population of undocumented immigrants would rather focus on catching actual criminals instead of chasing after people with no legal status, what makes ICE think they’d want to join them?

Tom Saggau, spokesperson for the union that represents LAPD officers, said he needed to “pop a Tums and get back” to me about ICE’s push, then never responded to a follow-up (try Pepto-Bismol next time!). Meraz said his members are “not concerned with the national stuff, they want to do the local and state law” — but ICE is looping them in anyway.

He and other deputies accompanied la migra “several times” over the summer during immigration raids. “They’d call us for support in the sense of ‘We’re getting overrun by protesters and bad actors — can you guys handle?’

“We don’t get into the politics,” Meraz said again. “But our people do not want to get involved in federal enforcement.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/69a1e2d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F5c%2F7207c93245b6a27053308642ae62%2F1520409-mla-me-sweater-drive-occupy-ice-la-ces-00975.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:56:56.169363

The Department of Homeland Security blasted a federal judge’s order preventing the Trump administration from scrapping temporary protected status for more than a million Venezuelan and Haitian nationals in the United States.

The temporary protected status, or TPS, applies to over 1 million people from the two countries, allowing them to remain in the U.S. for the time being, according to The Associated Press.

The outlet reported that it applies to 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians.

""For decades, the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program. Its use has been all the more dangerous, given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""While this order delays justice, [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,"" the statement continued. ""Under God, the people rule. Unelected activist judges cannot stop the will of the American people for a safe and secure homeland.""

Judge Edward Chen, of the Northern District of California, wrote in his ruling that ending the TPS was ""unprecedented"" and that Noem’s actions broke the law.

""This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,"" the judge wrote.

TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians was granted under the Biden administration, as the qualifiers for immigrants from a country to get the status include an active war or a major public health crisis in their homeland.

The Arizona-based Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (FIRRP) on Friday added Honduran children to a lawsuit filed last weekend that resulted in a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of dozens of migrant children to their native Guatemala.

In a statement, the organization said it had received reports that the U.S. government will “imminently move forward with a plan to illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

FIRRP did not immediately provide The Associated Press with details about what information it had received about the possible deportation of Honduran children. The amendment to the organization's lawsuit is sealed in federal court. The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to email requests for comment on Friday and Saturday.

Over Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration attempted to remove Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in shelters or with foster care families in the U.S.

Advocates who represent migrant children in court filed lawsuits across the country seeking to stop the government from removing the children, and on Sunday a federal judge stepped in to order that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July’s arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and El Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the suit was initially filed last week.

Some children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their legal right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.

“Our concern is that there is no benefit to the child to have ICE agents present at those meetings,” Lopez said.
In some cases, they have made an arrest at the sponsor appointment ORR scheduled.” Lopez said the interrogation of unaccompanied children seems to have been particularly focused on children from Guatemala and Honduras.
“Unaccompanied children should not be treated like criminals,” Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit argued.
The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the various federal agencies involved to publish all records pertaining to the alleged interrogations of the unaccompanied children and their sponsors.","The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the agency tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children, has allegedly implemented a secret policy in recent months allowing immigration agents and criminal investigators to interrogate those children and their potential U.S.-based sponsors, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week by Al Otro Lado, a San Diego-based binational organization that provides legal services and humanitarian aid to migrants.

Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Health and Human Services of violating its “statutory mandate to act in the best interest of children in its care.” The lawsuit seeks to make public through the Freedom of Information Act all records pertaining to the allegedly secret policy.

“Health and Human Services has a legal obligation to act with the best interests of the child in mind,” Cassandra Lopez, Al Otro Lado’s litigation director, said in an interview Friday. “Historically, HHS hasn’t been allowed to share information about the children’s cases … with (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or with other agencies, and that’s because they’re supposed to be doing everything they can that’s in the best interest of that child, and not working to … help ICE carry out enforcement activities.”

Lopez said Al Otro Lado is aware of deportations that have occurred as a result of ICE agents interrogating unaccompanied migrant children and their potential sponsors. She said it has become a widespread practice across the U.S.

A Health and Human Services spokesperson said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not respond Friday to messages seeking comment.

Typically when an unaccompanied minor arrives at the U.S. border, the child is placed in the care of Health and Human Services, and specifically the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to the lawsuit. Health and Human Services is supposed to play no role in the apprehension or initial detention of children and by law is not a party to children’s immigration proceedings.

As soon as the Office of Refugee Resettlement takes an unaccompanied child into its care, the agency is supposed to put that child in contact with their parents, guardians or other relatives and begin a process of finding the child a suitable sponsor living in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Those sponsors are required to undergo background checks and complete an assessment process that identifies potential risks and safety concerns.

The lawsuit alleges that in recent months, ICE agents have been accompanying personnel from the Office of Refugee Resettlement during routine meetings with children and seeking to interrogate them without an attorney present. The suit contends that ICE agents have done the same with potential sponsors.

“Our concern is that there is no benefit to the child to have ICE agents present at those meetings,” Lopez said. “People are afraid of ICE. So if ICE is going to be present at those meetings, people will no longer want to be sponsors for unaccompanied children, which means kids will stay in custody, and they may be less willing to fight their immigration case or to pursue relief that they are eligible for.”

Lopez said nonprofits have been raising the alarm for months now that ICE agents and other immigration officers have been accompanying Health and Human Services personnel to routine meetings and welfare checks at sponsors’ homes.

“They’ll be there with an ICE agent who is then asking a bunch of questions about other people besides the child,” Lopez said. “ICE (also) seems to be riding along almost every time a sponsor clears the last hurdle to gain release of a child in an attempt to interrogate sponsors. In some cases, they have made an arrest at the sponsor appointment ORR scheduled.”

Lopez said the interrogation of unaccompanied children seems to have been particularly focused on children from Guatemala and Honduras.

Included in the lawsuit is an Aug. 5 email that Al Otro Lado obtained that was apparently sent by Adam Loiacono, ICE’s deputy principal legal advisor for enforcement and litigation. The email, which was sent to other ICE and DHS personnel, appears to lay out ICE’s legal justification for questioning unaccompanied migrant children at shelters operated by Health and Human Services.

The email stated that agents from Homeland Security Investigations, an agency under the DHS umbrella that’s focused on global organized crime, intended to interview unaccompanied migrant children in part as an effort to help Health and Human Services reunite the children with their families.

The email said that another goal of the interviews was to “take administrative action as appropriate … if the parent or guardian is unlawfully present in the US.” The email also stated that the children, who are entitled by law to an attorney “in legal proceedings or matters,” did not need legal counsel during the interviews with HSI agents because the interviews would not qualify as legal proceedings or matters.

Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit said the unaccompanied children, many of whom have “suffered trauma, abuse and persecution in their home countries,” are entitled to care and reunification by experienced teams dedicated to child welfare.

“Unaccompanied children should not be treated like criminals,” Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit argued.

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.
Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.
A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.
In June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states.","SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal protections that have granted more than 1 million people from Haiti and Venezuela the right to live and work in the United States.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco for the plaintiffs means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the United States. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians.

Chen scolded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for revoking protections for Venezuelans and Haitians that the judge said would send them ""back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries.""

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.

Presidential administrations have executed the law for 35 years based on the best available information and in consultation with other agencies, ""a process that involves careful study and analysis. Until now,"" Chen wrote.

Plaintiffs and their attorneys welcomed the news Friday, although it's unclear if it would help people who have already been deported.

""In recent months, people have suffered unspeakable harm — including deportation and family separation — due to the Supreme Court greenlighting Secretary Noem's discriminatory and harmful agenda,"" said Emi Maclean, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California. ""That must end now.""

A DHS spokesperson said in an email that the program has been ""abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program"" and that ""unelected activist judges"" cannot stop the American people's desire for a secure country.

""While this order delays justice, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,"" the email read.

The second Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has resulted in ramped-up arrests of people in the country illegally, but also an end to programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in immigrants' homelands are deemed unsafe.

According to court documents, the administration has terminated Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and Humanitarian Parole designations for about 1.5 million people, prompting lawsuits across the country from immigrant advocates.

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States, if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.

Haiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.

Their designations were to expire in September but later extended until February, due to a separate court order out of New York.

Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the countries to stay on for what is a temporary program. Attorneys for the government have said the secretary's clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program are not subject to judicial review.

Designations are granted for terms of six, twelve or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.

The secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violated the law, Chen wrote.

The case has had numerous legal twists, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In March, Chen temporarily paused the administration's plans to end TPS for people from Venezuela. An estimated 350,000 Venezuelans were set to lose protections the following month.

But the U.S. Supreme Court in May reversed his order while the lawsuit played out. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals, and did not rule on the merits of the case.

Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.

A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.

After appearing for her annual immigration check-in, a restaurant hostess living in Indiana was deported back to Venezuela in July. Her husband, a construction company supervisor, cannot work and care for their baby daughter at the same time.

In June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states. He slept for about two weeks on a floor, terrified he would be sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. His wife cannot maintain the household on her earnings.

""I am not a criminal,"" he said in the declaration, adding that ""immigrants like myself come to the United States to work hard and contribute, and instead our families and lives are being torn apart.""

The Supreme Court's reversal does not apply to Friday's ruling. The government is expected to appeal.

Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.
“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.
Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.
“So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job.","Federal immigration authorities say they arrested dozens of South Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, marking what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest-ever raid — and triggering outrage from South Korean officials who expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.

But a search warrant seen by The Independent shows that agents were seeking the arrests of only four workers at the facility — who are Latino.

Agents arrested 475 people on Thursday at a battery facility on the sprawling Hyundai campus in Ellabell, Georgia — roughly 30 miles west of Savannah — as part of an “ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” according to Homeland Security.

A judge approved the warrant following a months-long investigation, according to Steve Schrank, a special agent in charge of Homeland Securities Investigations Atlanta. Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.

No criminal charges were announced, but Schrank said many of the factory’s workers were living and working in the United States without legal permission.

The massive operation targeted a sprawling, 3,000-acre complex in a state under Republican leadership, which has hailed the $7.6 billion Hyundai Motor Group investment as one of the state’s largest economic development projects in its history.

South Korea's biggest automaker began manufacturing electric vehicles at the plant last year, which employs more than 1,000 people. LG Energy Solution operates an adjacent battery plant set to open next year.

But Donald Trump’s administration did not appear to give its key ally any advance notice of the operation, which caught Seoul by surprise.

The country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong expressed “concerns and regret” following news of the arrests and urged “special attention to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens are not violated.""

“The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,” the ministry said following news of the arrests.

Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.

Responding to questions at the White House about whether his anti-immigration agenda is clashing with his efforts to pull billions of dollars of foreign investment into the economy, Trump said “they were illegal aliens” and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “was just doing its job.”

He wants to “get along with other countries, and we want to have a great, stable workforce,” he said in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday.

“And we had, as I understand it, a lot of illegal aliens, some not the best of people, but we had a lot of illegal aliens working there,” he said. “So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job. That’s what they have to do.”

In a statement, Hyundai said the company is “closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.”

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company said.

With a directive from the White House to make thousands of daily arrests, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has received record-breaking funding from Congress — expanding the agency’s budget to be larger than most countries’ militaries — to hire more officers and expand detention space.

The Trump administration has deployed federal agents across the country to support his aggressive mass deportation agenda with large-scale arrests and sweeps targeting major Democratic-led cities with large immigrant populations. A record 60,000 people are currently locked up in immigration detention centers across the country.

The administration has directed all federal law enforcement agencies to converge around immigration enforcement, drawing warnings from immigration attorneys and advocates that those arrest quotas will almost certainly include “collateral” arrests of citizens and others with lawful immigration status.

The country’s labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants within the first seven months of the year, including people who are in the country without legal permission, according to an analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data from the Pew Research Center.

That massive reduction has affected industries with large populations of foreign-born workers, including farming, construction and home healthcare.

Roughly 92 percent of construction companies reported project delays due to workforce shortages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/f8bc60db09c9e0da0c79415a96b5ce31,N,,2025-09-06 13:57:16.539326

Dinesh Tandon, who owns the Indian restaurant Indigo with his wife, said delivery sales have dropped about 30% in recent weeks.
In Mount Pleasant, another restaurant owner reported profits plunging by 60% because of the shortage of delivery drivers.","Yakson had a delivery to pick up in Washington, DC’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood, but first he scanned the street for immigration officers. A white truck parked nearby looked suspicious. He lingered, peering through the truck window for signs of an agent. Only when it seemed clear did he dart inside the restaurant, rushing the pickup.

“People are scared,” he told CNN, his eyes still on the truck.

The Trump administration’s move to surge federal law enforcement into Washington, DC, has reshaped the daily rhythms of immigrant life in the nation’s capital. With ICE now riding alongside local police, many food delivery drivers – a workforce that includes many Venezuelan migrants – say they no longer feel safe waiting on street corners for orders.

Some have switched from mopeds to bikes to avoid attention or potential stops for traffic violations, while others have left the city altogether, leaving local businesses struggling with delayed orders, vanishing customers, and steep drops in sales. Dozens of delivery drivers in DC used to gather outside businesses while waiting for their phones to “ping” to signal the next pickup. Street corners that once pulsed with salsa, reggaetón and lively chatter have fallen silent since the start of Trump’s law enforcement push in the capital.

CNN has reported that in the first two weeks of Trump’s crackdown last month, there was a more than tenfold increase over the typical ICE arrest numbers for the district. Many residents in migrant-heavy neighborhoods now worry about being picked up by ICE, with delivery drivers especially fearful.

‘Just let us work’

José, a delivery driver from Venezuela, told CNN that he changed from a moped to a bike to lessen the chances of being targeted.

“I have my wife and two children back in Venezuela (that I send money to) and bills (here) still need to be paid,” said José, who declined to share his last name.

José left Venezuela two years ago in search of a better future amid the country’s ongoing political and economic crisis, which has deepened under the country’s increasingly authoritarian government.

He told CNN being a delivery driver was his way to make ends meet. He said that after the law enforcement push in DC, his income has gone down.

“It’s hard, it’s very hard,” said José when discussing the current work environment.

During the Biden administration, thousands of Venezuelans were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), giving them work authorization and protection from deportation. The Trump administration has moved to end TPS.

Another driver, who’s been in Washington, DC, for three years, told CNN he has witnessed arrests that he considered unfair. “Not everyone does bad things – people deserve respect as human beings,” he said.

He added that many drivers have stopped showing up given the current climate.

“I’ve seen fewer delivery drivers on the streets because people are afraid of being deported. If someone does wrong, fine, apply the law. But those who work hard every day deserve the chance to keep working,” he said.

A different delivery driver, who asked to remain anonymous, had a simple plea: “Just let us work.”

“There is a lot of fear,” she continued. Two years ago, she fled Venezuela with her young daughter and sister amid the country’s political and social turmoil. “It’s a disaster,” she said of her homeland.

She began working as a delivery driver six months ago, drawn by the flexible hours that allowed her to earn an income while caring for her daughter.

Her sister, also a delivery driver, shares the same fear. If anything were to happen to either of them, she worries her daughter would be left alone, with no other family in the United States to turn to.

“I’m sad, scared, depressed — I don’t go into DC anymore. None of the women (who are) delivery drivers do; we all have young children,” she said. “My sales have dropped, and I’m still supporting my parents and grandmother back in Venezuela. My grandmother is very sick, and I help take care of all of them.”

Growing fears and declining sales

Some of the moped delivery drivers are Venezuela migrants who arrived in DC in 2022, bused in from Texas. They sought work and found that food delivery for the apps was not only an in-demand, steady job, but easy to get approved.

Delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub have varying requirements for their couriers. Some demand Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, while others only ask for a government-issued ID – a gap that’s made certain platforms more accessible to immigrant workers.

Video captured by a Washington Post reporter of one recent arrest of a moped driver went viral on social media. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the moped driver had come to the US illegally from Venezuela and had an order of removal from an immigration judge.

Leavitt has defended the federalization of DC, saying the administration is committed on making the nation’s city “safe and beautiful again.”

But immigration advocates say the change has fueled a climate of anxiety among food delivery workers. “A big fear is just being stopped and assumed to be undocumented – whether they are or not – and then getting arrested,” said Catherine Rubio of the Central American Resource Center. “There’s this fear that because they’re moped drivers, they’ll be targeted.”

Feeling unsafe in the city, some delivery workers have shifted to Maryland or Virginia, while others abandoned delivery work entirely and are now struggling to pay rent and bills, according to Amy Fisher, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid.

Some businesses have also taken a hit.

Dinesh Tandon, who owns the Indian restaurant Indigo with his wife, said delivery sales have dropped about 30% in recent weeks. “Earlier, orders were picked up instantly, without delays. Now we wait for drivers – sometimes they don’t even show up,” he told CNN. In Mount Pleasant, another restaurant owner reported profits plunging by 60% because of the shortage of delivery drivers.

In nearby Columbia Heights, Latino-owned businesses describe kitchens being short-staffed after workers were arrested, while longtime customers now avoid the neighborhood’s commercial corridors. One supermarket employee said his hours were cut to just two or three days a week, and that several coworkers had already been arrested.

Hector, a business owner in Mount Pleasant who declined to give his last name but goes by “El Dominicano,” said, “My sales have gone down, as you can see,” gesturing to his nearly empty coffee shop.

“We had just opened, but since ICE started showing up in the neighborhood, people are scared – not just Latinos, but Americans as well,” he said.

The Fourth Amendment protects citizens against arbitrary searches and arrests and serves as the basis of search warrants with a probable cause of crime. The resolution directs city staff to “uphold the 4th amendment at their workplace and city agencies and report back to Council any barriers to effective training on the 4th Amendment for any departments.”

The resolution says the city has “historically pursued equity and safety for all residents” and the trust of Durhamites is essential to the city carrying out its operations. It says the threat of “unconstitutional seizure” has prevented immigrants in Durham from “safely engaging in public life, including pursuing employment and education.”

The move comes less than two months after four ICE agents appeared at the Durham County Courthouse to detain an undocumented individual charged with felony. The officers donning plain clothes did not arrest anyone, but their presence sounded alarms among Durham residents and council members alike.

“Our residents witnessed ICE agents in our community, instilling widespread fear and uncertainty,” Mayor of Durham Leo Williams said of the event. “While local leaders cannot legally override the federal government’s use and weaponization of ICE, we can and must stand in strategic solidarity with our neighbors.” That same day, Durhamites organized a peaceful demonstration and march from the Durham County Courthouse against immigration enforcement.

The Fourth Amendment Workplace resolution was introduced by council member Javiera Caballero and supported by Siembra NC, an organization that supports Latino immigrant workers across North Carolina. Notably, Siembra NC also organized the rally for Duke bus driver Luis Alonso Juárez, who is at risk of losing his legal status in the U.S. after the Trump administration ended Temporary Protected Status for Hondurans.

Durham is the second city to pass such a resolution, with Carrboro being the first in the Triangle to enact a Fourth Amendment Workplace resolution in May.

At the council meeting, various Durhamites spoke in support of the increased protections to immigrants.

“Durham celebrates a rich diversity of residents and we understand that the Trump administration’s mass deportation targets a completely manufactured panic surrounding immigrants, puts anyone who does not appear white, anyone who does not speak English or has an accent, anyone regardless of papers or immigration status, at risk of abuse, abduction and even deportation to country they have no ties to,” said Elise Ballan, chair of the Durham Workers’ Rights commission.

Several immigrants and their families spoke in favor of the resolution, sharing stories of their anxieties in day-to-day life.

The passage of the resolution marks a win in the Durham community’s efforts against ICE presence in the city.

In February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers arrested 11 Durham residents they identified as “illegal aliens.” It was not clear whether the 11 detainees had search warrants against them. Durham residents with immigrant backgrounds said they were concerned about the safety of their family members and resorted to advocacy hotlines and local community organizations like Siembra NC for support.

Durham was listed a “sanctuary county” in April by the Department of Health and Homeland Security for allegedly failing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. County officials have since rejected that label and said the designation had “no legal or factual basis.”

The North Carolina General Assembly overrode Governor Josh Stein’s veto of the controversial House Bill 10, which directs local sheriffs to comply with federal immigration agents. In an Aug. 31 candidate forum, Mayor Pro Tempore Mark Anthony Middleton said that he would never support Durham Police Department collaborating with ICE in any fashion.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status.
The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud, or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press.

While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services such as prescription drugs and specialty care.

The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.

“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”

The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. without authorization off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics, and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois, and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.

At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.

“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud, and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”

Trump targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country without authorization.

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.

Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.

Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.

“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.

California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.

As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs, and dental care.

Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.

“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud, and abuse very seriously.”

It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.

California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.

Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.

And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”

“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”

Immigrants’ Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis, and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.

“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

In an email to the Maryland man, which was obtained by CNN, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said that given Abrego Garcia's concerns about being deported to several other countries, they now seek to remove him to Eswatini. The Department of Homeland Security previously notified Abrego Garcia of plans to deport him to Uganda, but he objected to the removal, citing fears of being persecuted or tortured.

""That claim of fear is hard to take seriously, especially given that you have claimed (through your attorneys) that you fear persecution or torture in at least 22 different countries,"" read the email, which listed the countries, including his home country of El Salvador, where he spent weeks in a notorious mega prison earlier this year after he was mistakenly deported.

""Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa,"" the email added.

An ICE official confirmed that Abrego Garcia will be deported to Eswatini, telling CNN, ""TRUE: An immigration judge ordered him removed and ICE will comply with that order.""

Abrego Garcia is currently in ICE custody after being brought back to the US to face human smuggling charges, but the Trump administration is trying to quickly deport him again, even before the trial concludes.

Last week, the federal judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case ruled that he cannot be deported until at least early October, after Trump administration officials are expected to testify about the government's efforts to re-deport him.

Abrego Garcia has said he prefers to be sent to Costa Rica, a country that has said it would be willing to give him some form of legal status should he be sent there.

The administration previously offered to eventually deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea, his lawyers told the judge overseeing his human trafficking case last month. However, Abrego Garcia did not accept the offer, according to a source familiar with his case.

Eswatini - formerly known as Swaziland - is located in Southeast Africa and is roughly the size of New Jersey. Governed by a monarch who has absolute power, Eswatini is one of four African countries that have struck a deal with the Trump administration to receive foreign deportees, along with Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.

Abrego Garcia is also separately seeking to renew his bid for asylum, a process that will play out before an immigration judge within the Justice Department.

After launching aggressive immigration raids that drew clashes with the public, Trump declared an emergency, controversially deploying the National Guard and U.S. Marines.
“If we didn’t send out the National Guard — Los Angeles would be burning right now!” Trump insisted over Truth Social at the time.
But he said sending in National Guard troops would not accomplish that.","CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker set in motion a campaign against federal intervention in his state more than a week ago.

Before immigration agents descended on Chicago and the threat of a National Guard deployment loomed, there was Pritzker, showing off the city on social media and in TV interviews. One interviewfeatured him walking on a sunlit path along Lake Michigan, and another had him sitting in a restaurant in the city’s Little Village neighborhood. This week, he staged a news conference in front of a Chicago River teeming with summer tourists and Trump’s hotel prominent in the background.

Pritzker and his team were laying out an intentional visual record. Their strategy was to stock national media with footage of a typical day in Chicago to show it was far from the “worst and most dangerous city in the World,” as President Donald Trump has proclaimed on his Truth Social platform.

“The president’s absurd characterizations do not match what is happening on the ground here. He has no idea what he’s talking about,” Pritzker told reporters this week. “There is no emergency that warrants deployment of troops. He is insulting the people of Chicago by calling our home a hellhole — and anyone who takes his word at face value is insulting Chicagoans, too.”

Pritzker’s tack is the latest employed by Democratic leaders from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to Baltimore who have become the target of a White House that has threatened to send — or has already sent — National Guard troops into their states.

In Chicago, Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have made clear that the Trump administration slashed public safety funding, including canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in grants, with specific impacts on anti-violence programs in the city, even as it is calling for law enforcement escalation. Johnson also criticized red states for lax laws that he said enable the flow of guns into his city.

Johnson laid out examples of Chicago working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to get guns off the streets.

“My question is: Why did Trump cut $468 million from the ATF’s budget in his nasty signature bill? Why did he cut funding for the agency responsible for getting guns off our streets by almost 30%?” Johnson said at a news conference.

Though crime is down in the cities Trump has targeted, Democrats have been faced with the unpopular prospect of appearing to downplay the issue and rejecting federal assistance. But as the clashes have escalated in recent weeks, Democratic leaders have fine-tuned their messages.

This week, Trump suggested he could send National Guard troops to New Orleans, noting that Louisiana’s Republican governor would be compliant. Some Democrats saw that as a sign that their focus on Trump only targeting blue states was working.

“You do see our governors leading and pushing back with the right approach,” said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic strategist. “None of them are saying crime is fixed.”

In the case of Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser — who does not have jurisdiction over the city in the way a governor does over a state — has engaged in a delicate balancing act of collaborating with Trump’s administration while reassuring a disapproving city council that she was not kowtowing to it.

Bowser cooperated with the White House as National Guard troops arrived. She acknowledged that crime dropped after the deployment and noted she and the city “greatly appreciate the surge of officers.”

Her posture at times was viewed as sidling up to the Trump administration, but Bowser clarified in subsequent remarks that she was attempting to find an exit strategy for the National Guard occupation.

“Our North Star is protecting home rule and the district’s autonomy,” she said. “What hasn’t worked, in my opinion, and hasn’t been efficient and is not on mission is National Guard troops, especially from other states.”

D.C. is now challenging the White House’s move in the courts.

Democratic strategist Mike Nellis noted Bowser’s situation stood out from those of other mayors.

“Thanking Donald Trump is like thanking Tony Soprano for protection you never asked for. But she’s in a very precarious position,” Nellis said. “Playing along and keeping her city safe is the smartest move for her — he and the Republican Congress can just slash whatever they want.”

It is unclear what Trump’s next move is, given a court ruling earlier this week calling his deployment of the National Guard and the Marines in Los Angeles illegal.

“We’re going in,” Trump told reporters of Chicago, even after the ruling on Los Angeles.

That legal fight was just one way California Gov. Gavin Newsom has combated Trump’s deployment of federal law enforcement in his city since June.

After launching aggressive immigration raids that drew clashes with the public, Trump declared an emergency, controversially deploying the National Guard and U.S. Marines. Soon, scenes of burning vehicles and looting dominated TV coverage.

“If we didn’t send out the National Guard — Los Angeles would be burning right now!” Trump insisted over Truth Social at the time. The clashes transpired over about five blocks, or 0.01% of Los Angeles County.

Newsom went on his own campaign against Trump, accusing the president of engaging in authoritarianism, challenging him in court, posting photos of National Guard members sleeping on the floor, and ensuring the public knew it was footing the $120 million bill for the deployment.

In one prominent moment, Newsom addressed Californians in a formal speech that was carried live. He laid out how the situation unraveled, citing the immigration raids, the protests that followed and the deployment of the National Guard, whose use of rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades he said only served to escalate it all.

“What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before,” Newsom said at the time. “This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation, putting our people, our officers and the National Guard at risk.”

There were immediate signs of a hunger for the pushback. Social media posts of Newsom’s full nine-minute speech were viewed more than 40 million times in less than a week, according to the governor’s office.

As he braces for what’s next in his state, Pritzker has sought to portray Trump’s impending action as overreach, including the president’s contention that Pritzker should call him and ask for the National Guard to be called to Chicago to deal with violence.

“When did we become a country where it’s OK for a U.S. president to insist on national television that a state should call him to beg for anything? Especially something you don’t want,” Pritzker said this week, referring to a potential National Guard deployment as an “invasion.” “Have we truly lost all sense of sanity in this nation that we treat this as normal?”

For Pritzker, reality has clashed with his strategy. Just after he recorded an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation” in Little Village, two people were shot in that heavily Latino neighborhood, one fatally. And over Labor Day weekend, nearly 60 people were shot in the city, again drawing the kinds of violence-laden headlines the governor and Chicago mayor were trying to avoid. Crime is down significantly this year, however. A WBEZ analysis found that this summer, Chicago had the fewest murders since 1965.

“I don’t want to hear another damn word from either one of them that everything’s OK, that we can handle this on our own,” Chicago City Council member Raymond Lopez said of Pritzker and Johnson. “Because what I’m hearing from them is that they have an acceptable loss of life expected from Chicagoans that I do not agree with.”

Brian Hopkins, who heads the Chicago City Council’s public safety panel, said the city would thrive with a boost in federal resources and agency coordination. But he said sending in National Guard troops would not accomplish that.

“It should be obvious to anyone involved that their true intentions are not to assist us, but they’re to embarrass us. They’re to score political points at our expense, and they’re using law enforcement tools as a pawn in their game,” Hopkins said. “It’s despicable and offensive and unconstitutional and wrong.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250902-JB-Pritzker-aa-121-1b838e.jpg",N,,2025-09-06 13:57:03.493981

Senior U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, a Barack Obama appointee, on Friday granted a motion for summary judgment from the National TPS Alliance, an immigrant advocacy group.

Noem’s decision, Chen said, would have returned migrants to “conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel.” He called Noem’s actions unprecedented and illegal.

In a statement to Courthouse News, a DHS spokesperson said that Noem will use “every legal option at the Department’s disposal” to end what they called “chaos” over the TPS program.

A representative for the National TPS Alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Created by the 1990 Immigration Act, temporary protected status is offered to people from certain countries where violence or economic duress would make their deportation difficult or unsafe.

About 600,000 Venezuelans were given TPS under the Biden administration, making them the largest TPS demographic in the country.

Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden issued an extension for those whose status was running out. Noem revoked the extension as soon as she took office.

In February, Noem also revoked status for Haitian immigrants. There are about 500,000 Haitians in the United States who benefit from TPS.

In their lawsuit, migrants and the National TPS Alliance claimed Noem’s actions were motivated by racial animus and violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

In March, Chen postponed Noem’s decision after determining that racial animus was indeed a likely factor. There’s never been such a revocation in the 35-year history of the TPS program. Then, in a one-page decision without explanation in May, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed Chen’s ruling.

In oral arguments on Aug. 1, the National TPS Alliance argued that in her haste to undo protections granted by the Biden administration, Noem sidestepped review requirements. The group argues she then fabricated reasons to justify her decision.

“It’s not a blank slate for her to decide whatever she wants,” Jessica Bansal, an attorney representing the alliance, said. “This is a statute that is designed to provide some measure of insulation against political changes to humanitarian refugees in this country.”

William Weiland, a Justice Department lawyer, said Noem considered the conditions in Venezuela as part of her decision.

“What they are asking you to do is weigh or reweigh"" that decision, Weiland told the judge.

On Aug. 25, Chen issued a temporary stay pending a ruling by the Ninth Circuit.

Four days later, the Ninth Circuit affirmed Chen’s postponement order. A panel said Noem lacked authority to end the Biden-era extension of TPS for Venezuelans.

“The TPS statute is designed to constrain the executive, creating predictable periods of safety and legal status for TPS beneficiaries,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw, a Bill Clinton appointee, wrote for the panel.

In a separate lawsuit, the National TPS Alliance is also challenging the Trump administration’s revocation of protections for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/127.0.0.1/2023/03/kristi-noem.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-09-06 09:56:32.255030
,Litigation,2025-09-06 13:02:48+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Immigration court rules judges can deny bond to millions of migrants - Los Angeles Times,"Rachel Uranga, www.latimes.com, rachel-uranga",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-06/top-immigration-court-rules-judges-can-deny-bond-to-millions-of-immigrants,"The Trump administration introduced the no-bond policy nationally in a memo in July — paving the way for the mandatory detention of immigrants.
The move came after Congress authorized expanding immigration detention and enforcement amid a crackdown inside courtrooms and at immigration check-ins.
For months now, those inside the immigration courts system have been pressed to implement Trump Administration policies.
That status expired on April 2 after the Trump administration terminated the program, a decision that is also tied up in litigation.
“This now solidifies that as the law of the land, unless and until [the] federal circuit court rules otherwise.”","A Trump administration policy to deny bond hearings to immigrants who entered the country without authorization was upheld by an immigration appellate board Friday, expanding mandatory detention to thousands of people already behind bars and potentially millions more nationwide.

Although the policy is being challenged in federal court, the ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals is likely to send an immediate chill through immigration courts where judges for decades have released individuals on bond whom they did not deem a flight risk or danger.

Those judges are now bound by the board’s decision. Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch but fall under the Department of Justice.

Immigrant rights attorneys say holding immigrants throughout their cases — a process that can sometimes take years — is intended to break the spirit of many and force them to sign their own deportation orders.

“This is an effort to increase the number of people in detention significantly,” said Niels W. Frenzen, director of the USC Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic, who is part of a team of attorneys who have filed habeas petitions for dozens of immigrants picked up during the summer raids in Los Angeles.

“Literally millions of people are now subject to being held without bond,” he said.

One of those is Ana Franco Galdamez, a mother of two U.S. citizens who has been in the country for two decades. She was getting treatment for breast cancer when she was arrested in a June 19 raid in Los Angeles County, where nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants reside, according to estimates.

She was denied bond and missed treatment, but she was eventually released after a lawyer filed a habeas case.

“Detention conditions are horrific, and they’ve gotten even worse,” Frenzen said. “The goal of the administration is to make it difficult for people to fight their cases and to give up.”

Federal judges have ruled in several cases that denying bond violated federal statues and constitutionally protected due process. The group is now seeking to block the no-bond policy in a class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Other lawsuits are also pending.

The Trump administration introduced the no-bond policy nationally in a memo in July — paving the way for the mandatory detention of immigrants.

The move came after Congress authorized expanding immigration detention and enforcement amid a crackdown inside courtrooms and at immigration check-ins.

Immigrants, most of whom had been following the rules to adjust, maintain or gain legal status, were arrested and detained.

For months now, those inside the immigration courts system have been pressed to implement Trump Administration policies. Judges have been fired, and the Pentagon has said it is identifying military lawyers and judges to temporarily sit on the bench.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts, did not answer specific questions from The Times — but pointed out that the ruling was a precedent.

“It strips judicial discretion in many cases,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “It basically says, if you entered illegally, only ICE can decide if you get out of detention.”

The Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision stems from the case of a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border in November 2022 near El Paso, Texas, and was later granted temporary protected status. That status expired on April 2 after the Trump administration terminated the program, a decision that is also tied up in litigation.

The board determined that immigration judges had no authority to issue bonds because immigrants “who are present in the United States without admission ... must be detained for the duration of their removal proceedings.”

In other words, the board’s decision treats people who have been in the U.S. for years the same as newly arriving immigrants at the border, who can be quickly deported without bond.

“We’ve had clients that are pregnant, we’ve had clients that are breastfeeding. We’ve had clients who have never been arrested, let alone commit, convicted of any crime ever, who’ve never missed an ICE check in — they’re all being told, ‘You’re subject to mandatory detention because of this new interpretation by the Trump administration,’” said Jordan Wells, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area. “This now solidifies that as the law of the land, unless and until [the] federal circuit court rules otherwise.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4474f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6051x3177+0+430/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F28%2F87bc0f50449f9db96dc4ba93022b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2219062487,N,,2025-09-06 09:56:36.079020

I’m Al Letson. There have been videos circulating lately that I just can’t get out of my mind. Speaker 2:If you have an ID and a [inaudible 00:00:12] of course you can take her. Speaker 3:Excuse me. Speaker 4:Oh, oh, no, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Al Letson:One shows this petite young woman holding onto a tree, gripping it with everything she has, while this older man, a guy with silver, gray hair, grabs her arm twisting it behind her back. Speaker 4:Are you kidding me, old man? Speaker 2:What you’re doing is (beep) illegal. Speaker 4:What you’re doing is kidnapping. What you’re doing is [inaudible 00:00:33]. Al Letson:The older guy has a mask on, he’s wearing black sunglasses, he’s got a gun and a utility belt but no uniform. And he’s using everything he has to try and peel the woman off that tree. Speaker 4:What you’re doing is [inaudible 00:00:47]. What the (beep) is wrong with you? Get the (beep) back. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Al Letson:She must understand, this is a losing battle for her, but she’s holding on for dear life. The older guy isn’t alone, there are others, they have guns and they’re also wearing masks. Speaker 4:They’re kidnapping her. Speaker 5:[Inaudible 00:01:03]. Al Letson:Eventually, the masked people get the woman off the tree and manage to push her into the back of an SUV. Her red apron stays on during the whole ordeal. She’s wearing an apron because she’d been selling food by a Home Depot when federal agents chased her down and arrested her. According to ICE, the woman is a migrant without legal status in the US. Arrests and confrontations like this one are surging across the country. Donald Trump:We will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. Speaker 7:A shocking ICE arrest was caught on video. Speaker 8:Now on the ground, on the ground. Speaker 9:[inaudible 00:01:45] Speaker 10:Protests are breaking out in response. Speaker 11:President Trump has a clear message for those that are in our country illegally. Leave now. Speaker 12:Stay indoors when possible and know your rights. Do not go out unless necessary. Stay at home and do not open the door to strangers. Al Letson:There are roughly 60,000 people in ICE detention according to NBC. Less than a third of them have criminal convictions. Speaker 13:No, Mummy. Speaker 14:They just smashed the window of that SUV and then they forced this man out of the car onto the ground. Al Letson:ICE is arresting people in front of their kids at school drop-offs, on the way to church, and at routine check-ins at immigration offices. And it’s only the beginning. The Trump administration’s mega spending bill will grow ICE’s budget from $8 billion a year to nearly 28 billion. More than many large nations spend on their entire military. ICE raids are remaking the country. Speaker 15:New census data shows that the foreign-born population in the US has declined by 2.2 million people from January to July. That’s the biggest six month drop on record. Al Letson:The thing is, those numbers, they’re not just numbers. Every single one of them is a person. For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have tried and failed to pass the kinds of immigration reforms that could have created a pathway for many of these folks to remain here legally. Instead, they’ve been vanishing with little to no due process. Who are they? And what happens to the family, jobs, and communities they leave behind? We begin at Loganville High School in the suburbs of Atlanta. In May, the school held its graduation ceremony. There were speeches from the valedictorian and the principal. An impressive rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner. And of course, the handing out of diplomas. Speaker 16:Say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light. Al Letson:But one graduate wasn’t there to receive his. Josue Trejo Lopezz had been deported just two weeks before the ceremony, along with his brother. Producer, Katie Mingle, has the story. Katie Mingle:Let me introduce you to these brothers. There’s Josue, the graduate, and his brother, Jose, who’s older, but just by a year. Their mom wanted them to have similar names they told me because she always liked the idea of having twins. She also had them wearing matching outfits all through their childhood and well into their adolescence. Until finally it occurred to them that it might be nice not to do this anymore. Jose Trejo Lopez:We were like, “You know what? Why are we dressing the same?” Katie Mingle:This is Jose, he’s the older one. Jose Trejo Lopez:And I told my brother I want to dress differently than you, I don’t want people to see that we are wearing the same shoes, the same shirt, the same pair of pants. I want to have a different style. It was around the age of 15 to 16. And I told my mom and she was like, “Okay, that’s fine, if that’s what you want, you can do it.” So my mom started buying different type of clothes. It was the same, but it was a different color at least. At least it was a different color, we were not looking the same. Katie Mingle:Now the brothers are 19 and 20 and they look different. Jose has glasses and Josue doesn’t. Josue has recently been sporting a long handlebar mustache that Jose is always telling him to trim. But still they’re very close. Josue Trejo Lopez:Like something happens to him, well, I will care about it, I’m there for him. And something happens to me, he’s there for me. Katie Mingle:That’s Josue. And Jose has something to add. Jose Trejo Lopez:Well, what he’s basically trying to say is that we are really supportive to one another. I would call our brother relationship like best friends. We are always together. And if I buy a pair of shoes and he doesn’t buy one, I don’t buy mine because I’m like, “You know what? I feel bad.” Katie Mingle:Josue and Jose left El Salvador with their mom when they were 10 and 11. It was 2016, and El Salvador had recently recorded the highest murder rate of any country in the western hemisphere. Jose told me gang members had started approaching kids at school offering them cell phones to join up. The boys’ mom wanted to bring her sons to a place where they’d be safer and have a chance at a better future. Plus a lot of their relatives were already in the US. So the family took a long journey through Guatemala and Mexico, crossing the border into Texas, and eventually making their way to Georgia. Their aunt was living in a suburb of Atlanta and they moved in with her and her kids. Jose remembers how different it felt from El Salvador. Jose Trejo Lopez:And now going to a country where you see kids playing basketball, playing soccer, or riding a bike in the street. You’re seeing all those beautiful houses, even the grass, the green grass, the landscape, it was so beautiful to me. And I was like, “Dude, I love this.” I really like this type of life. Katie Mingle:School was a different story though, a foreign country in and of itself. The brothers didn’t know what their teachers were saying. Jose said he used Google Translate to try to do his homework. Not speaking English was such an immense barrier that it sometimes felt to Jose like the only barrier. Jose Trejo Lopez:I remember I used to tell myself, hey, when I learn the language, I’m not going to have bad grades, I’m going to have A’s and B’s. Katie Mingle:Their cousins told the boys to download Duolingo. And they did. They also watched TV and movies in English. And slowly they got better at the language and started to fit in. Jose Trejo Lopez:At the end, I was like, “Dude, this is what basically feeling an American is like.” Having friends, graduating from high school, good grades. Katie Mingle:In their early years in the country, an attorney had encouraged the boys and their mother to apply for asylum. In 2018 their claim was denied. And Josue, Jose and their mom, Alma, all received deportation orders. Since coming to the US, Alma had given birth to a third son, Mateo, a US citizen with significant disabilities. Alma didn’t believe Mateo could get the healthcare he needed in El Salvador, so she kept her family in the US and began looking into other pathways to remain here legally. In the meantime, they always went to their check-ins with ICE even when they interfered with other things. Jose Trejo Lopez:I remember one time that we had a check-in during the finals, and I was like, “What can I do about it?” How am I going to deal with these two things going on at the same time? If I miss the final, I’m going to get a zero. If I miss the check-in, I’m going to be in a big deal with ICE. Katie Mingle:What did you do? Jose Trejo Lopez:I went to the check-in, I missed my final. Katie Mingle:Jose graduated from high school in May of 2023 and moved to New York City to live with a family friend. Josue should have graduated in the spring of 2024, but he was behind on credits. He was determined not to have to do a whole extra year of high school though. And his teacher told him he’d need to do a bunch of extra credits on top of his regular load of classes to be able to finish in December. Josue Trejo Lopez:She told me, “Look, you need to do 11 credits.” I was like, “Jeez, 11 credits.” But I tell myself, yeah, if I don’t do this I’m never going to get out of here. I even stop playing video games, I just focus on school. I did three credits in one month. Katie Mingle:Josue told me he worked harder than he’d ever worked. And he did it. He finished all of his high school credits in December of 2024. And he joined his brother in New York. His plan was to return to Georgia to walk in his high school graduation ceremony in May of this year. But that’s not what happened. In March, the boys went to a routine check-in at an ICE field office in Manhattan. Their mom had traveled from Georgia to go with them. When they got there, they were told that the building was full and they’d have to send an email requesting another check-in. And then an ICE officer said something strange to Jose. Jose Trejo Lopez:He told me, “Good luck.” I was like, “Wait.” That’s kind of strange to me because during this whole time that I have to go check-ins never an ICE officer had told me good luck. Katie Mingle:The boys were hoping their next check-in would be in maybe six months or a year. But when they got the email it said they should report back in two days. This is the point where some people might have chosen not to show up, just lay low and hide out. But Jose told me they never considered this, they wanted to follow the rules. When they returned to the ICE office two days later, and were called up to the counter, the officer asked if they knew they had a deportation order. Jose Trejo Lopez:And I was like, “Yes, I know.” And he was like, “Okay, and are you doing something about it?” And I was like, “Yeah, yeah, I have all my papers that my attorney gave me.” It was like this big. It was for especially juvenile status. Katie Mingle:The previous year in 2024, the boys had begun the process of applying for special immigrant juvenile status. If they got it, the status would allow them to remain in the country legally. Theirs was exactly the kind of situation that didn’t used to be a priority for ICE. In previous administrations, even in Trump’s first term, it was generally the case that if you had a deportation order but you could prove you were pursuing some kind of legal remedy, ICE wouldn’t detain you. This was especially true if you didn’t have a criminal record. And Jose and Josue have never been in trouble with the law. But none of this seemed to matter to the ICE officer who was looking at their paperwork. Jose Trejo Lopez:He only looked at the first page. And then he was like, “This is not going to help you, this is worth nothing basically.” And gave it back to me. And he was like, “Okay, give me a minute. I’m going to talk to my supervisor.” Katie Mingle:The boys went to sit down. They were nervous. Eventually, the officer came back and asked Jose and Josue to follow him to another area, away from their mom and little brother who they’d come with. Jose Trejo Lopez:And then he told me, “Okay, you are being detained by ICE and you are going to be put in removing proceeding. If you have anything that you want to give it back to your mom, your phone, your wallet, give it to me right now so I can bring it to her.” I look back and my brother was in handcuff. When they put the handcuffs on me, I was like, “Is this really happening to us?” We had never been put in handcuffs because we had no problems with the law. I couldn’t express the feelings that I was feeling in that moment because I felt like a criminal. Katie Mingle:Just like Jose and Josue, more than half of all people arrested by ICE in New York City in the first five months of the Trump administration had no criminal record according to data gathered by The New York Times. And according to federal data, half of those arrested were detained just like this during routine check-ins and court appearances. Jose Trejo Lopez:They didn’t let us say at least bye to our mom, not to our little brother. Katie Mingle:The boys were taken to a detention facility in Buffalo, New York. Jose Trejo Lopez:And I told the ICE officer, “Hey, can you keep us together at least? Me and my brother together to the same detention facility on the same unit?” He was like, “Yeah, I’m going to try.” But I guess he didn’t try because we were separated as soon as we got to the detention facility. Katie Mingle:After a couple of weeks, their lawyer filed a petition, and they did get to be together. Jose, with the authority vested in his single extra year on this planet, tried to be strong for his younger brother. Jose Trejo Lopez:Basically, I was the pillar, I was the one holding everything at that moment. I told my brother, “Hey, bro, don’t cry or don’t act up, just relax, we’re going to go through this. Either way, if we don’t like it, we’re going to go through it.” Katie Mingle:Jose only cried once he told me, alone in the bathroom where Josue couldn’t see. Josue, for his part, tried to keep the mood light. Josue Trejo Lopez:I was just trying to make this guy laugh. Katie Mingle:On May 7th, both boys were deported back to El Salvador. They hadn’t been there in almost 10 years and they had no close family or friends still in the country. Their mom, Alma, is still in the US. It’s possible she’s been spared from deportation thus far because she’s the sole caretaker for her disabled son, Mateo. I asked Alma if knowing what she knows now she regretted bringing Jose and Josue to the US. She told me she doesn’t. Her sons had so many more opportunities here than they would’ve had in El Salvador. But she told me that she does regret allowing them to go to that final check-in appointment with ICE. A distant family friend, who the boys had never met, picked them up from the immigration office in El Salvador and let them live in his house for their first few months in the country. His name is also Jose, which is maybe why they always call him the old man. Josue Trejo Lopez:Well, he’s an old man, he’s already 69 years old, so he’s older. Katie Mingle:It was from the old man’s apartment near the capital city of San Salvador that Josue watched his high school graduation ceremony on a live stream. Speaker 19:We made it. From freshman jitters to senior celebrations, we have navigated some of the most defining years of our lives. Tonight we celebrate Katie Mingle:Josue had planned to be there with his friends. He already had his cap and gown. Instead, he watched on YouTube as his former classmates’ names were called. And one by one they walked across the stage to get their diplomas. Speaker 20:Robert Torres, honors, going on. Josue Trejo Lopez:Now, we’re just watching to see my friends walking. I thought they’re not going to call my name. Katie Mingle:But then they did call his name. Speaker 20:Josue Trejo Lopezz. Katie Mingle:Older brother, Jose, was in another room and he could hear Josue watching the live stream. Jose Trejo Lopez:I was hearing him watching the ceremony, and then hear they call his name and then he came out. I have a video of it because I was like, “I’m going to record just to have as a memory that this happened to us.” Katie Mingle:Jose holds up the phone selfie-style and films while his brother lays his head on his stomach and sobs. “Did they say your name at the graduation?” Jose asks his brother. Jose Trejo Lopez:[foreign language 00:16:37] Katie Mingle:“The good thing is that you got your diploma,” Jose tells him. Jose Trejo Lopez:[foreign language 00:16:46]. Katie Mingle:“You managed to graduate, that’s good.” Jose Trejo Lopez:[foreign language 00:16:55]. Katie Mingle:At the end of the graduation ceremony, a student speaker emphasizes that it isn’t just the end of one chapter, it’s the beginning of another. “It’s time to embrace the changes ahead,” she tells the crowd, “and walk confidently toward the future.” But when I ask Jose to imagine what a future might look like in El Salvador, he’s at a total loss. Jose Trejo Lopez:I don’t have an answer to that yet, or soon, because it is hard. It is hard to think about. I don’t know if we’re going to start looking for jobs. I don’t know if we’re going to start thinking about a future in here. First because it’s just going to be me and my brother, right? Being separated from our family is actually one of the biggest trauma that we have right now. Because who is going to be supporting us? Who’s going to be directing us in this country when we don’t know how the system works? I really want to go back to my family. I want to go back to the country that I call my home. Katie Mingle:Before they were deported, Jose and Josue both imagined they might attend a trade school of some kind, become mechanics or welders. Help support their mom and their little brother, and eventually have families of their own. Now they’re just hoping some way, somehow they get back to the country where that future still exists. Al Letson:As schools across the country start a new school year, teachers and administrators are bracing for what ICE’s continued expansion could mean for students, including how it might affect attendance. Last spring, some California school districts saw attendance drop by more than 20% because of fear over immigration raids. That story was produced by Katie Mingle. When we come back, we’ll meet a restaurant owner trying to figure out how to keep her business open after her brother is detained by ICE. Speaker 21:It’s becoming almost like it’s not sustainable for me to just keep operating the way I’m operating. I did not include my brother being picked up by ICE in my business plan. Al Letson:You’re listening to Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting in PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Like a lot of restaurants these days, the Nigerian restaurant Suya Joint in Boston has an Instagram account. Scrolling through the last few months of their posts is a mouth-watering experience. Pictures of stir-fried tofu and jollof rice, glistening fried plantains, pineapple upside-down cake. But in late June, there’s a different kind of post. The owner of the restaurant, Cecilia Lizotte, has written a note to her followers that begins, “Dear Suya Joint family, help us bring Paul home.” The note goes on. “Being forced apart like this is tearing through the heart of our home and community.” Cecilia’s brother, Paul, the manager of the restaurant, had been detained by ICE on his way to church. The news over the last few months has been full of stories about restaurant employees being picked up by ICE, and when Mother Jones reporter, Julia Lurie, saw Suya Joint’s news on Instagram, it made her wonder what it’s like for the people left behind, what it’s like to run a restaurant or any business really, when a key employee, who happens to be your brother, suddenly disappears. Julia Lurie:I went to eat at Suya Joint for the first time in May with a reporter friend of mine who’d been raving about it. It was just a few weeks later when I saw the post on Instagram. The owner, Cecilia, would later refer to it as a cry for help, and that’s what it seemed like to me. Her post was basically saying, “I’m not sure if I can handle this.” It made me want to know more, so I headed back to Suya Joint. Cecelia Lizotte:So you see that this is where all of us have a Hi, hi, hi. Yeah. Those are everybody- Julia Lurie:That’s Cecilia greeting a kitchen full of cooks prepping for dinner. Cecelia Lizotte:It sounds so good in here. Speaker 4:Thank you. Thank you so much. Julia Lurie:Cecilia learned to cook from her grandmother, who ran a little restaurant in Central Nigeria. After she came to Boston in 1999, she started catering out of her home, which eventually led to opening Suya Joint as a brick and mortar. Now she has two locations and a food truck, and last year Cecilia was a semi-finalist for the prestigious James Beard Award. Cecelia Lizotte:Maybe inside, just it’s a little tighter. Speaker 4:Okay. Julia Lurie:We duck into a storage room away from the commotion to talk about Paul. Cecelia Lizotte:Don’t mind the mess. Julia Lurie:No problem. Cecilia and her brother balance each other out. Cecilia is the outgoing one. Loud, chatty, wears chunky jewelry in bold colors. Paul meanwhile is quiet, attentive, the go-to guy for critical behind-the-scenes jobs. It’s Paul who picks up ingredients from New York, who comes in to fix the plumbing in a pinch, or waits tables when Cecilia is short-staffed. Cecelia Lizotte:When I see him coming through the door, it’s like, I feel really, really safe. It’s like, “Yes, you are here.” Julia Lurie:Paul was on his way to church on Father’s Day when he was picked up by ICE. When I asked ICE about Paul’s case, a representative said that he’d been, quote, “Unlawfully residing in the United States since August 2019 when he violated the terms of his lawful admission.” Records show that Paul came to the US on a visitor visa in 2019 and applied for asylum later that year. When he was arrested, his case was ongoing. He had a social security number and a work authorization that’s valid until 2029. Under previous administrations, people like Paul wouldn’t have been a high priority for ICE, but things are different now. When he was arrested, Paul asked the officers if he could make a phone call to his sister. Cecelia Lizotte:I felt like someone just sucked my blood, my air, anything like, “How do you live?” Julia Lurie:Yeah. There’s not a playbook for someone in your situation. Cecelia Lizotte:No, there’s absolutely not a playbook. You wake up one day, you feel energized, and then within a twinkle of an eye, it’s almost like, “Where do I throw up?” It’s that bad. It’s terrible. Julia Lurie:There’s an eerie familiarity to Paul’s detention. The year before he came to the States, he was kidnapped by Boko Haram. The militant group was targeting journalists, and at the time Paul was working as a crime reporter for the Nigerian Television Authority. Paul talked about the kidnapping in a BBC documentary back in 2019. Paul Dama:I was scared. I was really, really scared because I started to imagine the trauma my family members were going to go through. Julia Lurie:Paul and Cecilia’s mom got the call from Boko Haram telling her he’d been kidnapped. Cecilia says her mom was literally speechless, kept fainting because of the news. The family scrambled to come up with the nearly $13,000 to free him. According to Paul’s asylum application, they even sold most of their property to make it happen. After four hellish days, Paul was released. Nigerian police told him they couldn’t guarantee a safety, advised him to leave the country. In his asylum application, Paul wrote, “This is why I’m here in the United States where I can feel safe and have my freedom guaranteed.” Cecelia Lizotte:And now in Boston, in America, literally right now as we speak, I just feel like, “Here’s another second kidnapping, he’s been picked up, and here we are at the mercy of everybody.” Julia Lurie:When I met with Cecilia, Paul had been sitting in a detention center in Dover, New Hampshire for two weeks. She seemed to be running on adrenaline moving 1,000 miles a minute. I had the sense that talking to a reporter was just one more item on her mile-long to-do list, which in a way, it was. She had to collect character statements for Paul’s upcoming hearing. She had to be there for her daughters, for her staff, for her relatives in Nigeria who were distraught about what was happening. And then there was Paul’s lawyer who could call at any moment looking for documents. Cecelia Lizotte:Before they can finish asking the question, I already know kind of the answer and I know exactly where to find it. And then, “Here you go, here you go.” Julia Lurie:Right now, Cecilia’s top priority is getting ready for the bond hearing, when a judge will decide if Paul can be released from detention while his asylum case is ongoing. Cecilia knows he faces an uphill battle. Last year, Paul was charged with two misdemeanors for operating a vehicle under the influence. Both times he was found sleeping in his stopped car, keys in the ignition according to police reports. Cecilia says he was in a dark place at the time, grieving the sudden loss of their mother and pulled over to sleep. In both cases, a judge sentenced Paul to a year-long probation. He also had to pay a fine and complete a program for impaired drivers. Typically, if you complete the terms of the sentence, in a case like this, the charges can be dismissed. Cecelia Lizotte:We all have our own dark, whatever moments that we’re living with. This guy came out and he’s like, “Okay, you know what? This is not it.” And he’s been like in therapy. He has done so much extensive things to make sure that he’s doing the right things. Julia Lurie:When I left the restaurant, Cecilia seemed overwhelmed but also focused. She had a mission, which was getting ready for the bond hearing. We agreed we’d check in after it was over. On the day of the hearing, I called Cecilia, no answer, no response to text either. A few days later I call again and she picks up sounding exhausted. Paul’s bond was denied. Paul’s lawyer told Cecilia that the DUIs had come up in the hearing and the judge wasn’t convinced Paul should be released. So are you doing with this news? Cecelia Lizotte:Thank you. It’s crazy. Julia Lurie:How is it for you to be working? I’m imagining it would be kind of hard to be positive and stuff like that around customers. Cecelia Lizotte:No, no. This is very, very difficult. And I think when I met with you all, I was hopeful I was doing okay, but then as time goes on, I’m just getting more and more defeated, just very, very much getting sick mentally, emotionally. It’s becoming almost like it’s not sustainable for me to just keep operating the way I’m operating. I don’t think anybody say like, “Okay, when I’m writing a business plan included this,” so I did not include my brother being picked up by ICE in my whole entire business plan. I’m not able to operate the establishment basically because it’s crazy. Julia Lurie:Cecilia told me she’s having trouble sleeping. She’s crying a lot, and this sounds like a bad metaphor, but it’s actually quite literal. Cecilia, the award-winning chef, has lost her appetite. Cecelia Lizotte:It’s just little nibbles like cat, and I’m like, “No, this is not good.” Julia Lurie:One of the many things weighing on Cecilia are all of the expenses. There are the legal retainers, $2,500 for the bond hearing, $13,000 for the asylum hearing, and then there’s all the cost of living that Paul normally would’ve paid for himself. Cecelia Lizotte:We are now left with paying all his rent, insurance, car payment, phone bills. It adds up. It piles up. Julia Lurie:This may sound naive, but I never really thought about all the recurring normal life expenses that pile up when a person suddenly disappears. It’s not like when someone dies and there’s no question, you cancel their rent and their phone bill. This is different. Cecilia has to decide, does she keep paying his $1,300 rent in hopes that he comes back, or does she go clean out his apartment? And Paul, of course, hates that she’s been put in this position. Cecelia Lizotte:He was very, very devastated, upset with the fact that all these things that now is put on the family is something that he is strong, capable of doing what he’s been doing all this time. So he’s very much distraught. Julia Lurie:Ever since news broke of Paul’s arrest, donations have poured in. Within two weeks, a GoFundMe for Paul’s legal expenses raised $32,000. Sometimes customers leave little notes of support in the delivery instructions of takeout orders. Cecilia shared one with me that said to leave the order in the lobby, and then went on, quote, “I’m so disgusted to hear about Paul Dama. I’ll do anything to help. Thank you for being my comfort food for the last five years.” Cecelia Lizotte:We’ve been receiving a lot of support from customers that we’ve never seen before based on what they’ve heard maybe on the news or they’ve read on the newspaper just to make sure that the establishment is sustained and it’s going. But me, the owner, is breaking. Julia Lurie:In moments when she’s feeling down, Cecilia seriously considers abandoning the life she’s built here, closing down the restaurant, going back to Nigeria even though she’s a US citizen. Her daughters and employees hate when she talks like this. They’re holding onto her and they want her to stay strong for them. But Cecilia’s like, “I’m trying to stay strong, but without Paul, who am I holding onto?” Cecilia talks to Paul almost every day. During one of their recent calls, a friend Paul made in detention got on the phone. Cecelia Lizotte:Then he explained to me how Paul is almost like they call him the president. They’re like, “You are our president.” Any question they have go to Paul, anywhere for them to feel some sense of a comfort, “Go to Paul, go to Paul.” I was joking with Paul like, “You can’t leave because you have a lot of almost like followers that are looking up to you to make this whole entire thing make sense.” Julia Lurie:Cecilia, of course, knows exactly how they feel. Al Letson:That was from Mother Jones reporter, Julia Lurie. You can’t talk about the federal government’s deportation efforts without talking about Los Angeles. Trump famously activated the National Guard on LA streets, and ICE has been targeting the city for months. But a tiny LA newsroom that used to be focused mostly on tacos has been tracking ICE and fighting back. Speaker 5:I’ve been going through hundreds of DMs, where they’re being spotted, so be careful, mi raza, keep your bootstraps tight. Al Letson:That’s next on Reveal. Stay with us. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today we’re telling stories of people rounded up as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. Our last story takes us to Los Angeles, where since June, thousands of people have been swept up in aggressive raids. ICE and Border Patrol are raiding car washes, Home Depots, outdoor markets, places where undocumented immigrants work and hang out. Federal agents have no arrest warrants and they’re picking up random individuals. Then in July News Anchor:A federal judge just ruling ICE and the Border Patrol must stop their aggressive tactics immediately, saying, “There is a mountain of evidence the feds are in fact breaking the law.” Al Letson:The judge said federal agents may not go after people based on their race or ethnicity or because they speak Spanish or work in a particular industry. That same day, Border Czar Tom Homan came on Fox News and acknowledged that that is basically what the government is doing. Tom Homan:They just got through their observation, get articulable facts based on their location, the occupation, their physical appearance, their actions. Al Letson:For Homan, it’s how agents establish reasonable suspicion. For the judge, it’s profiling. The Trump administration appealed the judge’s order and lost, and now they’ve appealed up to the Supreme Court. The Department of Homeland Security continues to claim that the raids do not target Latinos and are based on investigations. Officials say they’re going after criminals, but according to an analysis of government data, agents arrested just over 4,300 people in June and July in Los Angeles. About 86% were Latino, and less than a third of the people arrested had a criminal conviction. People are scared and angry and they’re turning to a tiny newsroom called L.A. Taco for information about where ICE raids are happening. As you might’ve guessed from the name, L.A. Taco writes about food, but since June, it’s been using its deep roots in Los Angeles to set the record straight and expose what ICE is doing in the communities it covers. Reveal’s Steven Rascón spent time with L.A. Taco to learn how it ended up in the trenches of one of the biggest civil rights moments in the country’s recent history. Steven takes it from here. Audio:Salsa. Salsa? It’ll be 50 cents. Steven Rascón:A cook pulls a fish filet out of the fryer, lays it over some tortillas, and tops it off with some diced tomato, then hands it to a customer. Audio:[Spanish 00:02:45] Steven Rascón:It’s lunchtime at Tacos Baja in East Los Angeles. Memo Torres:The go-to order here is the Baja-Style Fish Taco. I’m going to get that. Steven Rascón:Memo Torres knows his tacos well and so does his colleague, Javier. Javier Cabral:My name’s Javier Cabral. I’m the editor-in-chief of L.A. Taco. Steven Rascón:Javier and Memo have been reviewing places like this for years. They even won a James Beard Award for their food coverage. Javier Cabral:I actually grew up coming here with my parents on Wednesdays because they’re super cheap tacos. They used to be a dollar. I think right now, they’re $1.59 now, so taco inflation. That’s not bad. Memo Torres:That’s bad at all. Javier Cabral:That’s not bad. They’re not letting people inside right now, which I think is interesting. Steven Rascón:Tacos Baja is serving tacos but behind locked doors. Javier Cabral:They also have the sign, check it out. Memo Torres:“[Spanish 00:03:29] ICE.” Steven Rascón:“Everyone is welcome here, except ICE, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” Javier Cabral:And it says, “Private property. No trespassing. Federal agents prohibited without a judicial warrant,” with “ICE” crossed out. Steven Rascón:The signs are up because this past June, ICE agents raided a local food truck called Jason’s Tacos. Jason, the owner, posted this video to Instagram after the raid. You can see the truck is empty, carne asada left sizzling on the grill. Jason Devora:Wow. There’s no joke, guys. They took all my employees, all of them. It’s crazy. Within like two minutes. Steven Rascón:Jason’s Tacos is just one of hundreds of taqueros that L.A. Taco has written about over the years. ICE was now targeting them. Javier and Memo know these people. It was personal. Memo Torres:Where our taqueros, our beloved taqueros are closing now because Steven Rascón:Memo made a video about it for L.A. Taco’s Instagram. Memo Torres:Folks are scared and rightly so. After, especially after seeing Jason’s Tacos, two taqueros get abducted, and four of his clients? That’s wild. Steven Rascón:If there ever was such a thing as a perfect crisis for L.A. Taco to be ready for, this was it. Years of reporting on local businesses had created trust and a big online following, and that trust was starting to pay off because people were now sending Memo tips about what ICE was doing. Memo Torres:I’ve been going through hundreds of DMs, where they’re being spotted, and it’s a pretty general theme. The theme is working Latinos, so be careful, mi raza. Keep your bootstraps tight. Steven Rascón:Memo was swamped with information, so the team decided that the raids should take priority over their taco coverage, and soon L.A. Taco’s Instagram became a daily journal for ICE activity across Los Angeles. Memo Torres:It’s June 20th and this is your Daily Memo as to what’s been going on in LA today, and boy, has it been busy. ICE has been everywhere. All right, so It’s Tuesday, June 24th. It’s Wednesday, June 25th and these are your ICE recaps for L.A. June 27th, the 22nd straight day of the ICE siege here in Los Angeles. They were at the Home Depot and a car wash in Huntington Park downtown on 6th and Grand, taking people, went back to the Walmart in Pico Rivera Steven Rascón:As Memo speaks, videos run behind him showing men in masks, carrying rifles, wearing tactical gear, dressed like they’re going to war. ICE is everywhere and people feel targeted. Video:This is the property of the church! This is Downey Memorial Christian Church and we are not okay with you being on our property. We are not okay Steven Rascón:Before resharing a video like this one, the first thing Memo does is find the person who shot it. Memo Torres:Either I or somebody on the team will reach out to them directly and be like, “Hey, hey, so we heard that they were at your taqueria. We heard that they were at the school.” Steven Rascón:He needs to make sure the video is accurate, and Memo gets a lot of videos. Memo Torres:Sometimes I have 43 different videos and pictures that I’m like, “Okay, how am I going to fit all this into a three-minute video?” Steven Rascón:For him, carefully documenting what’s happening in communities is a way to fight against the Trump administration’s false narrative. Memo Torres:They want to portray this picture as ICE being heroes and Border Patrol being heroes and out here being brave men, yet in the same light, it’s like we have to show what are they actually doing? Old men are getting tackled at bus stops. They shot at a kid in a truck. They brutalized this TikToker who was recording them. You got to show the brutality, the criminalization of just people that are working, street vendors, people that are day laborers, people that are at their jobs gardening. Steven Rascón:We reached out to the Department of Homeland Security to ask why so many Latinos without criminal records were being targeted. We shared the numbers with them. A senior DHS official wrote back and did not dispute the data, and instead continued to claim without proof that, quote, “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, and rapists.” We also asked about several incidents that were violent, and the official said, “In each case, the agent’s actions were justified.” Throughout the summer, Memo keeps documenting and he’s noticing U.S. citizens are getting swept up in the raids. Javier Ramirez:They said that they came looking for immigrants and the only person that they got was a U.S. citizen. Steven Rascón:This man, Javier Ramirez, was working at a tow yard when Border Patrol agents arrested and detained him at a federal detention center, and there was Joe Garcia. Memo Torres:The U.S. citizen that was arrested at the Home Depot in Hollywood and then transferred Steven Rascón:And then transferred to the same federal detention center after he filmed a raid and told a group of men not to respond to ICE agents. Around the same time, Border Patrol arrests another U.S. citizen after he tries to protest a man being detained. He spent three days in federal detention. A reporter named Aisha Wallace-Palomares discovered the story. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:I was like, “Oh my God, this is huge, a U.S. citizen detained by federal immigration agents.” Steven Rascón:At the time, Aisha was a freelance reporter covering the ICE protests outside the Federal Building. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:Outside of the Federal Building in Downtown, L.A. Steven Rascón:It’s where ICE processes the people it plans to deport. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:Because tear gas has been deployed here over the past few days and there’s still remnants of those. Steven Rascón:One day, she notices a family standing outside of the detention center. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:They didn’t look like protesters. They looked out of place. And I was like, “Hey, you know, what’s going on?” Being a nosy reporter. And they were like, “Our son was taken today.” And I said, “Your son was taken today? Taken by who?” And they said that he was taken by ICE and that he was a U.S. citizen. Steven Rascón:Aisha sticks around. She talks to the dad. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:And he said, “Yes, and I have a video of it,” and I had actually recognized the video because it had come up on my feed earlier that morning. It had gone viral already by that point because of the brutality. Steven Rascón:The video shows a thin 20-something-year-old, Adrian Martinez, wearing a blue Walmart vest yelling at the agents for detaining a janitor. He cleans the plaza where Adrian works. The agents tackle Adrian, grab him by the neck, throw him into a Border Patrol vehicle and take him away along with the janitor. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:And so at that point, I decided I needed to step away from them for at least a few minutes because I needed to send an Instagram DM to L.A. Taco and I was just crossing my fingers hoping that they would see it and be interested in the story. Steven Rascón:L.A. Taco DMs back, and by that night, Adrian’s story is on the Daily Memo. Memo Torres:Adrian, according to his family, is a U.S. citizen, but this is just hard to watch, guys. I mean, he’s a 20-year-old. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:I think within an hour or two, it was already at like 600,000 views. Steven Rascón:The video creates outrage online. Major news outlets are picking up the story, NBC, CNN, L.A. Times. And a few days later, Border Patrol Assistant Chief David Kim comes out with a different story on Fox News. David Kim:The narrative right now is just a U.S. citizen was arrested for no reason, but that subject punched two agents. Steven Rascón:We asked Border Patrol whether they had any proof of this because the videos Aisha and Memo looked at show that Adrian definitely confronts ICE agents, but he never throws a punch. They didn’t get back to us. Oscar Preciado:My name is Oscar Preciado. Steven Rascón:Oscar was there that day and also didn’t see Adrian throw a punch. He recorded the original video that went viral. Oscar Preciado:I do photography for music events and then I also do Instacart on the side. Born and raised here in East L.A. So that day, I was working Instacart at the Pico Rivera Walmart, and that’s where we saw them pull up to a janitor that was out there cleaning, doing his job, and that’s where everything just got pretty crazy. Video:Hey! Hey! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Steven Rascón:Oscar’s video shows Border Patrol agents driving into a parking lot. People are honking their horns at them. Two men run when they see them. One of them is the janitor. Video:Get out of the way. I don’t know him. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Oscar Preciado:When I turn back around recording, that’s where Adrian shows up. Steven Rascón:Adrian pulls up in a black sedan. He approaches a Border Patrol agent. Video:What the fuck? What is he doing? He’s a fucking hard worker! [inaudible 00:12:34] Video:Hey, we’re taking that as motherfucking evidence! I’m giving that to- Car, put him in the car! Steven Rascón:It’s clear from the video that Adrian isn’t the only one upset. People try to block in the agents with their cars. Oscar is trying to capture as much as he can on his phone. Video:I’m not doing shit! Hey, what the fuck, dude? You can’t be doing that shit! Adrian Martinez:The guy smacked the phone out of my hand. I picked it back up, kept recording. Video:It’s my civil right! I can fucking record you if I want! Steven Rascón:Oscar keeps recording through a cracked screen. He captures three agents restraining Adrian. Video:Why are you guys putting hands on homie? Look at all these little bitches. [inaudible 00:13:31] He’s a U.S. citizen! Right here. Steven Rascón:Oscar and Adrian didn’t know each other, but when they saw the janitor get taken away, it felt like an injustice to both of them. Adrian Martinez:I feel like that’s kidnapping. You can’t just go to their job and like, “Oh, I’m taking you.” It’s not right, so. Oscar Preciado:You’re upset about what’s going on and what they’ve been doing to the communities and anybody that’s of color, any brown person they see. Steven Rascón:Since June, ICE has detained at least seven U.S. citizens. Some were let go and charges were dropped, but Adrian was indicted. Federal prosecutors are charging him with conspiracy to impede a federal officer. Pedro Chavez:I sympathize with Adrian. Steven Rascón:Pedro Chavez is an immigration lawyer. He runs an organization called Fear of Return, and he’s become a bit of a TikTok sensation for his legal advice, and he’s been following Adrian’s arrest. Pedro Chavez:He looked at this man that is being abducted by ICE and he probably saw his uncle or he saw his dad in that man. It’s like I can feel his emotion. Steven Rascón:Pedro says Adrian’s conspiracy charge is something the government has been using on people who stand up to ICE. He says federal prosecutors would have to prove that what happened at the Walmart wasn’t spontaneous but planned, and that’s a stretch. Pedro Chavez:Because it’s clear that they didn’t meet beforehand. Steven Rascón:Instead, he says they reacted in the moment and were outraged at what they saw, ICE driving around looking for someone to pick up. Pedro Chavez:They didn’t have arrest warrants, they didn’t have search warrants, they had nothing. It was a roving patrol and they admitted it in the complaint. Steven Rascón:Roving patrols are what a federal judge ordered the government to stop doing because they lead to racial profiling. Memo is still getting videos showing they’re happening. Memo Torres:This law enforcement is not obeying laws. They’re not obeying the restraining orders, and then these people are masked. They don’t want to identify themselves. They’re roaming around doing whatever they want. Steven Rascón:He says this is what’s driving the anger across L.A. Memo Torres:How can you not be angered at the cruelty of it, the barbarianism of it? Steven Rascón:And L.A. Taco is committed to covering this story for the long haul. Memo Torres:L.A.’s currently very traumatized. I’ll tell you that right now. People are traumatized. These people, these immigrants, they’re not criminals. They’re our neighbors. Al Letson:After the ICE raids started back in June, tens of thousands of Angelenos took to the streets to express their anger. Trump deployed Marines and the National Guard to tamp down protests and even used soldiers during raids. This month, a judge ruled that it was illegal and said the president violated a federal law that bans the military from being used to do domestic policing. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the judge’s decision.

The first week of school in parts of Long Island has been marked by concern and confusion after reports surfaced of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appearing near school grounds as students arrived for class.

Community advocacy group Islip Forward shared photos that allegedly show masked ICE officers positioned just outside Brentwood High School early Wednesday morning, coinciding with the school’s opening day. A similar scene was reportedly observed outside Alverta B. Schultz Middle School in Hempstead on Thursday.

Parents and community members are expressing alarm at what they say is a troubling presence near institutions meant to be safe havens for children.

“The kids are supposed to have peace, not be in fear,” said Marta, a Brentwood grandmother. “It’s terrible. The kids haven’t done anything wrong — they’re not criminals. I don’t understand why [ICE] has to come near the school.”

The Brentwood School District responded by issuing a message to families, assuring them that ICE agents did not enter school property. However, the proximity of immigration enforcement activity to the school has nonetheless left many residents shaken.

School officials in Hempstead said the officers did not enter school grounds, and said there has been no substantive given to the district that there were actual ICE agents at the school.",https://images-cf.news12static.com/3kqcuzntcg31/2SDKkVaMGQbnszsKWCJqfk/135c62e28c6fafa21205285c70b97e40/d7bb79a3-2c42-40fe-a777-2f193ca86aa3.jpg?fit=thumb&w=600&h=340&q=80&fm=webp,N,,2025-09-06 06:56:18.932026
,Agencies,2025-09-06 08:13:42+00:00,The Independent,ICE raid on Hyundai plant in Georgia sparks international uproar as key ally South Korea ...,Alex Woodward,,,,,https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/hyundai-ice-raid-georgia-south-korea-b2821184.html,"Federal immigration authorities say they arrested dozens of South Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, marking what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest-ever raid — and triggering outrage from South Korean officials who expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.
Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.
“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.
Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.
“So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job.","Federal immigration authorities say they arrested dozens of South Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, marking what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest-ever raid — and triggering outrage from South Korean officials who expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.

But a search warrant seen by The Independent shows that agents were seeking the arrests of only four workers at the facility — who are Latino.

Agents arrested 475 people on Thursday at a battery facility on the sprawling Hyundai campus in Ellabell, Georgia — roughly 30 miles west of Savannah — as part of an “ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” according to Homeland Security.

A judge approved the warrant following a months-long investigation, according to Steve Schrank, a special agent in charge of Homeland Securities Investigations Atlanta. Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.

No criminal charges were announced, but Schrank said many of the factory’s workers were living and working in the United States without legal permission.

The massive operation targeted a sprawling, 3,000-acre complex in a state under Republican leadership, which has hailed the $7.6 billion Hyundai Motor Group investment as one of the state’s largest economic development projects in its history.

South Korea's biggest automaker began manufacturing electric vehicles at the plant last year, which employs more than 1,000 people. LG Energy Solution operates an adjacent battery plant set to open next year.

But Donald Trump’s administration did not appear to give its key ally any advance notice of the operation, which caught Seoul by surprise.

The country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong expressed “concerns and regret” following news of the arrests and urged “special attention to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens are not violated.""

“The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,” the ministry said following news of the arrests.

Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.

Responding to questions at the White House about whether his anti-immigration agenda is clashing with his efforts to pull billions of dollars of foreign investment into the economy, Trump said “they were illegal aliens” and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “was just doing its job.”

He wants to “get along with other countries, and we want to have a great, stable workforce,” he said in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday.

“And we had, as I understand it, a lot of illegal aliens, some not the best of people, but we had a lot of illegal aliens working there,” he said. “So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job. That’s what they have to do.”

In a statement, Hyundai said the company is “closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.”

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company said.

With a directive from the White House to make thousands of daily arrests, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has received record-breaking funding from Congress — expanding the agency’s budget to be larger than most countries’ militaries — to hire more officers and expand detention space.

The Trump administration has deployed federal agents across the country to support his aggressive mass deportation agenda with large-scale arrests and sweeps targeting major Democratic-led cities with large immigrant populations. A record 60,000 people are currently locked up in immigration detention centers across the country.

The administration has directed all federal law enforcement agencies to converge around immigration enforcement, drawing warnings from immigration attorneys and advocates that those arrest quotas will almost certainly include “collateral” arrests of citizens and others with lawful immigration status.

The country’s labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants within the first seven months of the year, including people who are in the country without legal permission, according to an analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data from the Pew Research Center.

That massive reduction has affected industries with large populations of foreign-born workers, including farming, construction and home healthcare.

Roughly 92 percent of construction companies reported project delays due to workforce shortages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/05/20/17/G0CV4fnWUAAsFWC.jpeg?trim=0,86,0,8&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-09-06 06:56:25.190942

Agents on Thursday arrested 475 people, most of whom are South Korean citizens, at a construction site for an electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Ga., near Savannah, Steven Schrank, a special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, said at a news conference.

The raid was the culmination of an investigation that took place over several months, he said.

Mr. Schrank said that the workers arrested were in the United States illegally or were working unlawfully. No criminal charges would be announced on Friday, he said, adding that investigators were still determining employment details for those arrested, some of whom worked for subcontractors.

The operation aimed to ensure “a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law,” Mr. Schrank said.

Most of those arrested were held at the Folkston detention facility in Georgia on Thursday night.

The battery manufacturer, LG Energy Solution, which co-owns the plant with Hyundai Motor Group, said in a statement that its employees and those from its partnering companies had been taken into custody.

Hyundai said in a statement that none of those detained were Hyundai employees, as far as the company was aware.

“We are closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances,” Hyundai said on Friday.

It added that it was reviewing its processes “to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves,” including “thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors.”

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry confirmed on Friday that South Koreans were among those in custody, without saying how many.

Mr. Schrank told reporters at the plant on Thursday that some U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents had been detained initially and were being released.

Charles Kuck, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta, said two of his clients who were in the country under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa were caught up in the raid.

“My clients were doing exactly what they were allowed to do under the visa waiver — attend business meetings,” he said on Friday, noting that one of them “had just arrived on Tuesday and was leaving next week.”

James Woo, communications director for the Atlanta office of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said he had been on the phone all day with South Korean residents across Georgia.

“People are in shock,” Mr. Woo said, adding that there was deep concern about how those arrested were being treated by ICE officials. He noted that the Korean community in Savannah was small and “has never become one” with the plant and its workers.

“There aren’t the same resources you’d find in Atlanta,” he said. “People don’t know where to go, or how to find legal representation.”

The operation, part of President Trump’s crackdown on immigration, caused diplomatic alarm in South Korea.

Just over a week earlier, Mr. Trump hosted President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea at the White House, where the South Korean leader pledged to invest an additional $150 billion in the United States, including in battery manufacturing.

When asked on Friday whether he was concerned about his immigration agenda clashing with economic goals, Mr. Trump said that ICE was just doing its job.

“They came through illegally. They came into our country. So we have to do our job,” he told a reporter.

The operation on Thursday operation echoed other workplace raids, including a huge one conducted across various work sites in Mississippi during Mr. Trump’s first term. In 2019, federal agents raided several companies in what officials said at the time might have been the largest work-site enforcement action ever in a single state.

More than 600 immigrants who were believed to be working without legal documentation were apprehended during that operation. The Biden administration announced it was ceasing the practice of enforcement operations at businesses in 2021.

In another large workplace raid under the administration of President George W. Bush, 389 workers were arrested at a kosher meatpacking company in Postville, Iowa, in May 2008. The company filed for bankruptcy later that year.

The lithium-ion battery plant, which predated Mr. Lee’s pledge, was expected to start operating next year. It is the kind of large-scale, job-creating investment that the United States has sought from South Korea and other nations.

South Korean companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in American manufacturing in recent years, much of it incentivized by federal subsidies and tax breaks for semiconductor plants and electric vehicle factories.

The Trump administration has already backtracked on some of those commitments, possibly damaging anticipated returns for giants like SK Group, LG and Samsung.

In late July, the White House struck a deal with South Korea that would set 15 percent tariffs on most of the country’s exports to the United States.

South Korean executives told local media that they need their own technicians on-site, at least temporarily, to get all of their factories up and running. And at the same time, South Korean companies are paying billions of dollars in tariffs, diminishing the capital available to spend on new plants.

The Ellabell site is part of one of Georgia’s largest manufacturing plants. Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican, has promoted the $7.6 billion Hyundai E.V. factory there as the largest economic development project in state history.

The immigration operation brought construction to a halt at the battery plant, known as HL-GA Battery Company. A spokeswoman, Mary Beth Kennedy, said in a statement that the plant was cooperating with the authorities.

Jongwon Lee, a Korean lawyer who works in metro Atlanta, said on Friday that South Korean conglomerates are bringing huge investments into the United States, but there aren’t enough visas to sponsor trained workers to run these factories.

The blame lies with the American visa system, he said. The United States “invited us to invest in the U.S., but they don’t give Koreans proper visas.”

The Durham City Council passed the resolution on Tuesday with a unanimous vote to shield city workers against raids and arrests carried out by federal officials, according to The Duke Chronicle.

The Fourth Amendment protects citizens against unreasonable searches and arrests, and requires warrants with probable cause of a crime before seizing a person or property.

The resolution instructs city staff to ""uphold the 4th amendment at their workplace and city agencies and report back to Council any barriers to effective training on the 4th Amendment for any departments,"" The Chronicle reported.

The city has ""historically pursued equity and safety for all residents,"" the resolution stated, adding that having the trust of residents is essential to carrying out its operations.

The measure emphasizes that the threat of ""unconstitutional seizure"" has prevented migrants in the city from ""safely engaging in public life, including pursuing employment and education.""

The resolution comes after four ICE agents in plain clothes showed up without warning at the Durham County Courthouse in July to detain an illegal immigrant facing a felony charge for domestic violence, although the man did not make it to his scheduled court appearance and no arrests were made, WRAL reported.

""Our residents witnessed ICE agents in our community, instilling widespread fear and uncertainty,"" Mayor Leo Williams said in a statement after the incident. ""While local leaders cannot legally override the federal government’s use and weaponization of ICE, we can and must stand in strategic solidarity with our neighbors.""

Residents also organized a demonstration on the day of the incident to protest ICE raids and arrests.

""This is a direct threat to the safety and dignity of our communities. The Courthouse should be a place where people can seek justice, not where they’re hunted down by federal agents,"" Durham County Board of Commissioners Chair Nida Allam, who was part of the demonstration, said at the time.

At the council meeting for the resolution, several migrants and their families spoke in favor of its passage, expressing their anxieties in day-to-day life, according to The Chronicle. Other residents also pushed for added protections for illegal immigrants and training for city staff to enforce the new measure.

""Durham celebrates a rich diversity of residents, and we understand that the Trump administration’s mass deportation targets a completely manufactured panic surrounding immigrants, puts anyone who does not appear White, anyone who does not speak English or has an accent, anyone regardless of papers or immigration status, at risk of abuse, abduction and even deportation to [a] country they have no ties to,"" Elise Ballan, chair of the Durham Workers’ Rights Commission, said at the meeting.

In February, ICE arrested 11 people in Durham who were in the U.S. illegally, according to federal officials. Some Durham residents reported being concerned about the safety of their family members after the arrests.

The federal government accused Durham in April of being a so-called ""sanctuary"" community for allegedly failing to cooperate with immigration officials.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday released immigration court documents that outline its arguments against Abrego Garcia applying for asylum or receiving it.

A primary argument is that Abrego Garcia is a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization, MS-13, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he hasn't been charged.

Abrego Garcia, 30, became a flashpoint over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native country of El Salvador in March. The U.S. returned him in June, but only to face federal human smuggling in Tennessee, which his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive. He has pleaded not guilty.

Abrego Garcia filed a motion in Baltimore immigration court last month to reopen his 2019 immigration case and apply for asylum again. He was denied the first time because his request came more than a year after he arrived in the U.S.

Abrego Garcia had fled threats of gang violence in his native El Salvador around 2011 to join his brother in Maryland. And while his first asylum request was denied, he was granted protection from deportation to El Salvador because he had established a well-founded fear of gang violence there.

Abrego Garcia was released in 2019 under federal supervision and continued to live with his American wife and children. He checked in with ICE each year, received a federal work permit and was working as a sheet metal apprentice earlier this year, his lawyers have said.

Immigration experts have said that Abrego Garcia’s new asylum application could lead to a green card and a path to citizenship. But by reopening his 2019 case, he also risks being sent back to El Salvador.

The Trump administration stated in court documents this week that it would pursue returning him to his native country if he successfully reopens his previous immigration case.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s lawyers are playing with fire,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Friday. It added: “As a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization, MS-13, he is no longer eligible for his previous immigration relief.”

Abrego Garcia and his attorneys have repeatedly denied the MS-13 allegation. It stems from a day in 2019 when he was detained by local police in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

Abrego Garcia had arrived outside a Home Depot in search of work as a day laborer, according to court documents. Authorities had been told by a confidential informant that Abrego Garcia and other men outside the store could be identified as members of MS-13 because of their clothing and tattoos.

Abrego Garcia was never charged. He was turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and subsequently applied for asylum and ultimately received protection from being deported to El Salvador.

In February, the Trump administration designated MS-13 to be a foreign terrorist organization and wrongfully deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison, where he claims he was beaten and psychologically tortured. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lead immigration attorney, said in a statement Friday that Abrego Garcia would likely get asylum if he gets a fair trial.

“The only reason he was denied asylum in 2019 was because he did not file within one year of entering the United States, a problem which the government has now solved,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “If Mr. Abrego Garcia is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there’s no way he’s not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.”

This is the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project.

The detainment of South Korean nationals also sets it apart, as they are rarely caught up in immigration enforcement compared to other nationalities.

Here are some things to know about the raid and the people impacted:

The workers detained

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.

Some of them worked for the battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution that is slated to open next year, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site, according to Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations.

He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

But an immigration attorney representing two of the detained workers said his clients arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.

Attorney Charles Kuck said one of his clients has been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks, while the other has been in the country for about 45 days, adding that they had been planning to return home soon.

Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday that none of its employees had been detained as far as it knew and that it is reviewing its practices to make sure suppliers and subcontractors follow U.S. employment laws. LG told The Associated Press that it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens and is sending diplomats to the site.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None of them have been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said, but the investigation is ongoing.

Raid is the result of a monthslong investigation

The raid was the result of a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site, Schrank said.

In a search warrant and related affidavits, agents sought everything from employment records for current and former workers and timecards to video and photos of workers.

Court records filed this week indicated that prosecutors do not know who hired what it called “hundreds of illegal aliens.” The identity of the “actual company or contractor hiring the illegal aliens is currently unknown,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote in a Thursday court filing.

The sprawling manufacturing site

The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.

Hyundai Motor Group started manufacturing EVs at the $7.6 billion plant a year ago. Today, the site employs about 1,200 people in a largely rural area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Savannah.

Agents specifically honed in on an adjacent plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county’s Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.

Raid was the ‘largest single site enforcement operation’

From farms and construction sites to restaurants and auto repair shops, there have been a wide array of workplace raids undertaken in this administration. But most have been smaller, including a raid the same day as the Georgia one in which federal officers took away dozens of workers from a snack-bar manufacturer in Cato, New York.

Other recent high-profile raids have included one in July targeting a legal marijuana farm northwest of Los Angeles. More than 360 people were arrested in one of the largest raids since Trump took office in January. Another one took place at an Omaha. Nebraska, meat production plant and involved dozens of workers being taken away.

Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The majority of the people detained are Koreans. During the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2024, only 46 Koreans were deported during out of more than 270,000 removals for all nationalities, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Community members and advocates have mixed reactions

Kemp and other Georgia Republican officials, who had courted Hyundai and celebrated the EV plant’s opening, issued statements Friday saying all employers in the state were expected to follow the law.

The nonprofit legal advocacy organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta described the raid in a joint statement as “unacceptable.”

“Our communities know the workers targeted at Hyundai are everyday people who are trying to feed their families, build stronger communities, and work toward a better future,” the statement said.

Sammie Rentz opened the Viet Huong Supermarket less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Hyundai site six months ago and said he worries business may not bounce back after falling off sharply since the raid.

“I’m concerned. Koreans are very proud people, and I bet they’re not appreciating what just happened. I’m worried about them cutting and running, or starting an exit strategy,"" he said.

The raid reportedly resulted in at least 475 workers detained, many of whom were South Korean nationals — including some with legal status. It is the largest raid ever conducted in recent history at a single work site.

In response, the American Immigration Council issued the following commentary.

“These raids don’t make anyone safer. They terrorize workers, destabilize communities, and push families into chaos,” said Michelle Lapointe, legal director at the American Immigration Council, who is based in the Atlanta, Georgia area. “This historic raid may make dramatic headlines, but it does nothing to fix the problems in our broken immigration system: a lack of legal pathways and a misguided focus on punishing workers and families who pose no threat to our communities. Raiding work sites isn’t reform, it’s political theater at the expense of families, communities, and our economy.”

“Immigrant workers are the backbone of our economy, filling critical labor gaps in manufacturing and beyond. Nationwide, 5.7% of manufacturing workers are undocumented, and here in Georgia they make up 6.7% of that workforce. Raiding worksites instead of fixing our pathways to legal employment is cruel, wasteful, and deeply shortsighted. The chilling effect of these raids will make it less likely that people will show up to work, deepening labor shortages and hitting businesses hard at an already precarious economic moment,” said Nan Wu, director of research at the American Immigration Council.

By linking deportation to DUIs, H.R.
Consequences of Detention and Deportation If enacted, H.R.","On June 26, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 875, the “Protect Our Communities From DUIs Act.” While framed as a key tool for public safety, the bill could be one of the most far-reaching expansions of deportation grounds for our immigrant communities in recent history. If enacted, the bill would make driving while intoxicated or impaired a deportable and inadmissible offense, granting DHS/ICE expanded authority in an ongoing push to deport as many people as possible. Like the Laken Riley Act, H.R. 875 shows how public safety rhetoric is used to deepen the ties between the criminal legal system and immigration enforcement.

Although Representative Barry Moore (AL-01) authored the bill as a “common sense” approach to protect against drunk drivers, DUIs already carry severe immigration consequences. Under current law, a single misdemeanor DUI could not only trigger the revocation of a student or employee visa but also bar eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and asylum. If a controlled substance is involved, the immigration consequences escalate to prolonged ICE detention that can last months or years. H.R. 875 would go even further: elevating a DUI arrest to the same level as the most serious offenses, such as drug trafficking or murder. The bill would dramatically expand who faces these penalties to include legal residents who have lived in the U.S. for decades, and even survivors of crimes. H.R. 875 would also coincide with the more than $170 billion investment in immigration enforcement, making these agencies the most highly funded law enforcement agencies in the country. If enacted, the bill would dramatically contribute to family separation, travel restrictions, and detention in horrendous conditions.

Immigration Enforcement and DUIs

Over recent decades, the convergence of criminal and immigration law, referred to as “crimmigration,” has entangled immigration enforcement within everyday policing. Since 2002, ICE has entered 287(g) agreements with local agencies, authorizing officers to screen detainees in jails and enforce immigration laws in their jurisdictions. Notoriously, under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Maricopa County deputies routinely used race as an unconstitutional pretext to stop, detain, and arrest Latinx drivers, who were up to 9x more likely to be pulled over. By 2012, the Obama Administration phased out this “deputization” model, citing civil rights concerns. Under the Trump Administration, 287(g) agreements have surged from 135 in 16 states to over 700 across 40 states in five months. By linking deportation to DUIs, H.R. 875 would widen the net of immigration enforcement, extending it through traffic stops and sobriety checkpoints conducted by local officers.

Police discretion allows officers to initiate stops based on subjective judgment, such as perceived behavior, driver appearance, or vehicle condition. These decisions result in Latinx and Black drivers being stopped at higher rates, even when their driving mirrors that of white drivers. In an analysis of nearly 100 million cases nationwide, the Stanford Open Policing Project found racialized patterns in stops, searches, and seizures. By giving officers another basis for stops, H.R. 875 would heighten the risk of detainment and deportation of noncitizen drivers.

Checkpoints provide another avenue for discriminatory enforcement, as officers have broad discretion to stop or wave drivers through. At a Tennessee Highway Patrol sobriety checkpoint, officers pulled over driver Chelsea White and her husband, Hilario Martínez García; while White was released, Martínez García was detained and swiftly deported to Mexico. This case illustrates how checkpoints can sweep up drivers and passengers alike, putting immigrant community members at risk. Additionally, checkpoint locations are not random. In Chicago, 84 percent of checkpoints occurred in predominantly Black or Latinx neighborhoods, while predominantly white areas with more DUI incidents were overlooked. These placements deviate from guidelines that recommend placing checkpoints based on objective factors, such as the rate of alcohol-related crashes. H.R. 875 would expand officers’ authority in ways that disproportionately affect immigrant drivers and passengers.

Consequences of Detention and Deportation

If enacted, H.R. 875 would deepen the climate of fear and insecurity already experienced by immigrant communities. Immigrant families facing detention or deportation lose income overnight, pushing them into financial crises, food insecurity, and the threat of eviction.

This fear of deportation ripples outward, undermining trust in vital institutions like hospitals. Immigrant families often avoid or delay medical care, hesitate to send their children to school, and isolate themselves out of fear of surveillance or separation. In Los Angeles, recent ICE raids have made families too afraid to access basic health services or attend school in person. After recent wildfires, parents even delayed lead testing for their children due to these fears. Instead of promoting public safety, H.R. 875 will endanger public health by fueling distrust and uncertainty already weighing on immigrant communities.

Fear is intensified by the opacity of the detention system itself. Detained loved ones who abruptly disappear can be impossible to locate, leaving relatives in torment before learning where they are being held. Once located, detainees are subjected to inhumane conditions that immigration and legal advocates have long documented: sexual abuse, malnourishment, mental suffering, and medical neglect. Alarmingly, recent deaths in ICE custody have made 2025 one of the deadliest years in immigration detention.

Current enforcement already has harmful impacts on immigrant families. By broadening the grounds for deportation and tying immigration enforcement even more tightly to local policing through discriminatory traffic stops and DUI checkpoints, the bill will enable wider enforcement. The result would be more family separation, deeper distrust in public institutions, worsening public health outcomes, and policies that criminalize rather than support the inclusion of immigrant communities.",https://dornsife.usc.edu/eri/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2025/09/Blog_post_header_duitodeportation2-1024x589.png,N,,2025-09-06 02:56:22.915459

Recently, there have been numerous reports of ICE pulling over cars, questioning occupants, and taking people away in handcuffs in Troy and Rensselaer County. ICE agents have also been reported waiting outside homes early in the morning to confront individuals about their immigration status. In July, a Troy resident was detained and deported by ICE after applying for a green card, leaving behind his U.S. citizen wife and infant son. On July 7, video footage shared by the Troy Capital Region Sanctuary Coalition showed ICE agents escorting a man into an agency vehicle after being pulled over and questioned in front of City Hall.

Since February, at least 36 detainments have been reported in Troy, two in East Greenbush, and one green card deportation. These incidents have instilled fear among migrant community members, causing children to stay home from school and parents to be too scared to leave their homes for work.

Trump reacts to a bad week Trump greeted the waves of bad news with a characteristic mix of deflection, finger-pointing and anger.","Facing viral rumors of his imminent death, President Trump emerged in the Oval Office on Tuesday alive and scowling. Core tenets of his economic policies were under strain. Flashy diplomatic overtures to Moscow appeared to be backfiring. And a scandal over a notorious sexual abuser that has fixated his base was roaring back to life in Washington.

It was a challenging week for the president, whose aggressive approach to his second term has begun to hit significant roadblocks with the public and the courts, and overseas, with longstanding U.S. adversaries Trump once hoped to coax to his will.

The president called for an expedited Supreme Court review of an appellate court ruling that he had exceeded his authority by issuing sweeping global tariffs last spring — a decision that, if left standing, could upend the foundation of his economic agenda. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued jobs numbers showing a contraction of the labor market in July, a first since the depths of the pandemic in 2020.

New art lining a hallway in the West Wing features photographs of Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump said the Russian president had agreed to meet with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to discuss an end to the war. Yet, three weeks on, Russia had launched its most intense bombardment of Kyiv in years, and Putin traveled to Beijing for a military parade hosted by Xi Jinping, which Russian state media used to mock the U.S. president.

During an appearance in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, Trump said reaching a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine has turned out to be “a little bit more difficult” than he initially thought.

And a rare spree of bipartisanship broke out on Capitol Hill — in opposition to Trump’s causes.

A tense hearing at the Senate Finance Committee with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. laid bare concern over the direction of federal vaccination policy and public health recommendations under his leadership across party lines.

Trump declined to stand behind him wholeheartedly after the hearing. “He’s got some little different ideas,” Trump told reporters, adding: “It’s not your standard talk.”

On Wednesday, moments after a group of more than 100 women pleaded for Trump’s help from the steps of the Capitol seeking transparency over the investigation of their alleged abuser, Jeffrey Epstein, Trump dismissed the matter as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats.

“The Department of Justice has done its job, they have given everything requested of them,” Trump repeated on Truth Social on Friday. “It’s time to end the Democrat Epstein Hoax.”

Trump was close friends with Epstein for more than a decade. But his base has repeatedly called for the release of thousands of files in his case — and some of Trump’s staunchest allies in Congress are set to vote against his wishes for a discharge petition directing the Justice Department to do so in the coming days.

A far-right political activist released hidden camera footage this week of a Justice Department official claiming the agency would redact the names of Republicans, but not Democrats, identified in the files. In the video, the DOJ official also suggested that Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell was recently moved to a lower-security prison as part of a deal to keep her quiet.

Public support for Trump has appeared stable since July, with roughly 42% of Americans approving of his job performance across a series of high quality polls. But the end of the August recess in Washington — and the oncoming flu and COVID-19 season — could return public attention to subjects that have proved politically perilous for the president this week.

Polls show that a majority of the president’s Republican voters support vaccines. They oppose Putin and increasingly support Ukraine. And across the political spectrum, Americans want the Epstein files released, unredacted and in full.

A string of court losses

The president’s agenda suffered several setbacks this week, as federal judges across the country ruled his administration had broken the law in various instances.

In San Francisco, a federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of military troops in Los Angeles was illegal and barred soldiers from aiding immigration arrests in California in an order set to take effect next week.

In Boston, a federal judge said the Trump administration broke the law when it froze billions of dollars in research funds awarded to Harvard University. In another court ruling, a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala.

And on Friday afternoon, a federal judge stopped the Trump administration from taking away the deportation protections under Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and Haitians living in the United States.

While the court decisions represent a snag for key portions of the administration’s agenda, the cases continue to play out in court — and could ultimately turn in favor of Trump.

Legal experts are closely watching those decisions. In the case of the military troop deployments, for instance, some fear a reversal on appeal could ultimately hand the president broader power to send troops to American cities.

Trump has floated additional federal deployments — to Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans — in recent days.

Trump reacts to a bad week

Trump greeted the waves of bad news with a characteristic mix of deflection, finger-pointing and anger.

He warned that losing his appeal on tariff policy at the Supreme Court would render the United States a “third world country,” telling reporters, “if we don’t win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly.” And he said he was “very disappointed” in Putin.

After the parade in Beijing — which was also attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, a longstanding U.S. ally now ostracized by Trump’s tariffs — drew widespread media attention, Trump wrote on social media that the countries were conspiring together against the United States.

“We’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China,” he wrote.

In another lengthy social media post on Friday, Trump accused Democrats of fueling the Epstein “hoax” as a means to “distract from the great success of a Republican President.”

Days earlier, survivors of Epstein’s sexual abuse publicly pressured lawmakers to back a legislative measure to force the release of the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier.

“This is about ending secrecy wherever abuse of power takes root,” said Anouska De Georgiou, who was among the Epstein victims who held a news conference on Capitol Hill.

A few high-profile Republicans also broke with Trump on the Epstein issue, calling for more transparency on the investigation. Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she is willing to expose those who are tied to Epstein’s sex trafficking case.

On a phone call with Trump on Wednesday morning, Greene suggested he meet with Epstein’s victims at the White House while they were gathered in town. He was noncommittal, the congresswoman told reporters.

The survivors left town without a meeting. At the direction of the White House, Republican leadership continues to press Republican members to oppose efforts to release the files.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d299136/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5721x3004+0+405/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F6c%2Fe3e33e8c4c81963df82727aa2497%2F58309bc2ea7040e682f621faa558400c.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 23:56:36.419083

It was shortly after 10 a.m. when prosecutors said a squad of federal agents arrested Stover in a Downers Grove apartment parking lot. The FBI Chicago posted photos online taken of agents with the Joint Terrorism Task Force during the encounter.

According to a criminal complaint unsealed late Friday afternoon, Stover is accused of writing multiple threatening social media posts, including threats to kill ICE agents earlier this year, as well as threats against the U.S. President.

""The us president just said he wants to purpose build concentration camps for his political enemies,"" Stover allegedly wrote online back in April. ""Its war right here and now against this attacker or we die in slavery. Put down your posters and selfie sticks and pick up a weapon!""

Prosecutors also accused Stover of posting a photo in February of ""five rifle bullets- with the first names of five well-known U.S. political figures respectively written with marker on each bullet-placed on top of two hunting knives.""

Stover's social media activity had been monitored by the FBI's National Threat Operations Center for months, and the agency contacted the U.S. Secret Service to launch an investigation this past May.

On May 7, court records state Downers Grove police and the FBI ""entered a Clear and Present Danger request for Stover with the Illinois State Police (ISP)"" and the ISP revoked Stover's Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) Card, a state card that allows a person to possess or acquire firearms.

The next day, federal prosecutors said Downers Grove police responded to a 911 domestic-disturbance call at Stover's residence.

When they knocked on his door, investigators said Stover ""opened the door for officers, immediately shut it, then opened the door again with his hands in the air and an empty holster, a pocketknife, and a full magazine on his hip.""

No charges were filed in relation to the domestic-disturbance call, but given Stover's possession of multiple firearms and his FOID card revocation the day prior, he was placed under arrest.

According to prosecutors, Downers Grove police seized six handguns, five rifles, a shotgun, and ammunition, including the five rifle rounds with the first names of ""well-known U.S. political figures.""

Stover was ultimately released after state prosecutors declined to charge him with unlawful firearm possession.

After he was released, Stover was interviewed by a Downers Grove Crisis Intervention Sergeant and the FBI, in which he ""he expressed frustration about global affairs and the U.S. government.""

But prosecutors say the police encounter did not stop Stover from posting threats on social media.

He was active on his Blue Sky account, using exceedingly extreme language in his posts, court records show.

""ICE is a terrorist organization,"" Stover allegedly wrote in a July 7 post cited in his criminal complaint. ""Share this if you think we should shoot them down like dogs.""

At his first court appearance, Stover told the U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge David Weisman that he was employed and worked in ""air conditioning.""

Stover has not entered a plea to the federal charge he faces.

Given the violent and serious nature to the post, federal prosecutors asked that Stover remain in federal custody until a future detention hearing is held.

That detention hearing is scheduled for Sept. 10.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17751863_090525-wls-rivera-iteam-ice-threats-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-05 23:56:56.460879

These amendments would enhance congressional oversight over President Trump’s expansive use of the military for law enforcement operations in American cities, including without the consent or request of a state’s elected officials.

“Deploying the military to Chicago without the request or consent of Illinois’ elected leaders is a clear violation of the law by the President. Chicago does not need to be ‘saved’ by President Trump, and this is nothing more than a shameless scare tactic,” said Durbin. “President Trump continues to abuse his power as Commander in Chief, but Senator Duckworth and I are pushing for stronger oversight over his actions.”

“I’m proud to join Senator Durbin in sponsoring these amendments that will help ensure our military can remain focused on its core missions and prevent Donald Trump—or any President—from politicizing and misusing our Armed Forces for their own gain,” said Duckworth. “Forcing the military, uninvited, into our cities to intimidate Americans in their own communities does not make our nation stronger, it simply distracts the military from executing its core mission of keeping our nation safe from real adversaries who wish us harm. Trump’s threats against Chicago are more unwarranted, unwanted and unjust moves straight out of the authoritarian’s playbook that will only jeopardize civil rights, undermine our military’s readiness and ultimately weaken our national security.”

The amendments that Durbin and Duckworth announced include:

Amendment #3028 to curb misuses of military bases, installations and facilities for detentions by prohibiting the use of any military construction funds to construct, renovate or expand any facility forthe purposes of detaining migrants.

Amendment #3209 to draw a bright line between military and policing by prohibiting individuals from simultaneously serving as an employee in the Department of Defense and in any civilian law enforcement entity, except if they are members of the Reserves and National Guard and hold law enforcement roles solely in their civilian capacities.

Amendment #3210 to protect civil rights and prevent misuse of military by requiring the President to notify Congress and justify in writing before providing access to military equipment—including surveillance equipment—bases or facilities to support law enforcement, and require Congressional approval to extend any such support longer than 30 days. This amendment would make it harder forPresident Trump to use military bases for detention, provide military surveillance equipment to support police or DHS, and claim it is legal to deploy the military to American cities because they are only in support roles to law enforcement. In recent months, the Trump Administration has dedicated expensive DOD platforms, assets and facilities for support to law enforcement, including designating military bases in five states for DHS support, including Ft. Bliss which was once used for Japanese internment, and pulling expensive military systems away from their normal missions to assist DHS with surveillance within the United States along the border.

Amendment #3596 to prohibit DoD non-reimbursable support to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the purposes of immigration enforcement activities. The Trump Administration’s expansive use of the military for immigration operations, both domestically and overseas at Guantánamo Bay, has raised significant civil liberties concerns and risks eroding trust in the military. It is also a costly diversion of military resources that undermines readiness, as the Department of Defense (DOD) has provided such immigration enforcement support to DHS on a non-reimbursable basis, effectively forsaking the intent behind such Congressionally directed defense funds.

Amendment #3774 to prohibit the use of DoD funds for any activities that would violate the Posse Comitatus Act or that would infringe on powers reserved to the States under the Constitution.

Amendment #3775 to ensure applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act on the National Guard. This amendment would close an unintended loophole President Trump has abused to deploy National Guard troops across state lines for law enforcement support and absent invocation of emergency authorities under the Insurrection Act.

Amendment #3773 to prohibit the use of funds for any DoD deployment of National Guard forces under Title 32 authorities in a state or federal territory over the objections of the chief executive.

Both Durbin and Duckworth have repeatedly spoken out against President Trump’s threats to deploy troops and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to Chicago. Earlier this week, Durbin and Duckworth led Illinois delegation members in demanding that President Trump abandon his plans to deploy the military to the city, and the Senators wrote to the leaders of DOJ, DHS, DOD, and the FBI to request information about the Trump Administration’s plans to send federal agents and troops to Chicago. After reports surfaced that DOD planned to use Naval Station Great Lakes to enable operations by ICE officers, the Senators requested a meeting with the Secretary of the Navy. The Senators visited Naval Station Great Lakes earlier today.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Duckworth also successfully secured the following amendments in the NDAA that the Committee approved in July and are set to be considered by the full Senate:

Language to strengthen public trust of the military and enhance civil rights by requiring that servicemembers identify themselves as part of the military when assisting federal law enforcement in the United States. As the Trump Administration continues to send federal agents and our nation’s military into our communities to intimidate their fellow Americans, this provision ensures that servicemembers identify themselves properly—to avoid public misunderstanding about who is providing logistical support versus conducting arrests or law enforcement duties.

Ensure all servicemembers know their legal obligations during deployments both at home and abroad by mandating legal training to all servicemembers, including a refresher within 90 days of any mobilization or deployment, on their responsibilities under the law of armed conflict, rules of engagement, defense support for civil authorities and standing rules for the use of force within the United States. In light of the Trump Administration’s increasing use of troops to support law enforcement within the United States, this provision will ensure troops know how to responsibly operate within the bounds of domestic laws and protect American civil rights.

In a message from a state spokesperson, 13News confirmed that the deployment would be restricted to Indiana, but it would range across the state.

""Indiana National Guard personnel will not conduct law enforcement functions and will not make arrests,"" the spokesperson said.

""Indiana National Guard troops supporting ICE are scheduled to conduct in-processing and training, and are scheduled to be on duty by mid-September,"" the spokesperson said.

The Indiana National Guard is not currently tasked to mobilize to either Chicago or Baltimore.

The deployment of Indiana National Guard is part of a nationwide deployment of state national guards to support ICE operations.

It is separate from the thousands of guardsmen deployed in Washington, D.C. and expected in other Democrat-controlled cities across the country.

The news of the deployment was reported in late August, and Indianapolis-based immigration attorney John Broyels said the immigrant community is struggling.

""The anxiety level is off the charts,"" Broyels said. ""Clients are very anxious about what the future holds for them.""

""When you bring new people in that have no training or experience handling these matters and don't know the detention standards and rights of the inmate, you are going to have mistakes made,"" Broyels said.

Broyels said immigration laws exist for a reason, but he said the ""massive expansion"" is causing problems.

USCIS, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), screens and processes green card and citizenship applications.
“USCIS should be fairly adjudicating people’s applications for services,” Doug Rand, a former USCIS senior official during the Biden administration, told NBC News.
In August, DHS proposed a rule to limit the amount of time that foreign-born reporters, academics, students, physicians, and others can stay in the United States.
The Trump administration has also been targeting people who show up at courthouses or USCIS offices for immigration appointments.","U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is planning to recruit and train special agents who will be able to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute warrants against people who have allegedly violated immigration laws.

A final rule published today in the federal register authorizes the director of USCIS to conduct “law enforcement activities to enforce civil and criminal violations of immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS.” The rule is effective on October 6.

USCIS, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), screens and processes green card and citizenship applications. The agency also administers a number of programs, including those for people who seek to work in the United States, as well as humanitarian programs for victims of certain crimes and people who have been displaced by catastrophes in their home country, among others.

“This historic moment will better address immigration crimes, hold those that perpetrate immigration fraud accountable, and act as a force multiplier for DHS and our federal law enforcement partners, including the Joint Terrorism Task Force,” USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow said in a press release. (During his Senate confirmation hearing, Edlow, a former visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025, told lawmakers that “USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.”)

The rule states that: “The law enforcement authorities delegated to the Director of USCIS include, but are not limited to, the authority to investigate alleged civil and criminal violations of the immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS, issue and execute both search and arrest warrants, detain and remove aliens, and make recommendations for prosecutions or other appropriate action when deemed advisable.”

Previously, these duties were “only delegated to ICE and CBP regarding the enforcement of immigration laws.”

As per the new rule, the director of USCIS “will grant individuals or a class of individuals the authority to use non-deadly force, deadly force (in situations where the designated immigration officer or other persons are in danger), and initiate a vehicular pursuit to apprehend fleeing suspects who are attempting to avoid apprehension.”

DHS did not provide public notice or hold a public comment period for the rule, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming that the “normal notice and comment procedures do not apply” as the changes “do nothing more than organize internal DHS operations.” The rule, however, fundamentally changes USCIS’s role in the immigration system.

“USCIS should be fairly adjudicating people’s applications for services,” Doug Rand, a former USCIS senior official during the Biden administration, told NBC News. “It should not be scaring people from applying for services in the first place.”

DHS has made a number of changes to limit people’s pathways to live, study, and work in the United States. In August, DHS proposed a rule to limit the amount of time that foreign-born reporters, academics, students, physicians, and others can stay in the United States. Those who wish to stay longer than that time frame would have to apply to USCIS, “therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS,” according to DHS’s press release.

If adopted, the rule, DHS said, “will limit the amount of time that foreign students, professors, physicians, and other visa holders are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting.”

Also last month, USCIS announced that it will consider “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations” and “evidence of antisemitic activity” when reviewing noncitizens’ applications to live and work in the United States. The Trump administration has used baseless accusations of antisemitism to attempt to deport foreign-born pro-Palestine student activists, including Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil, who has a green card.

The Trump administration has also been targeting people who show up at courthouses or USCIS offices for immigration appointments. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has reported that ICE has been arresting people when they come to USCIS for biometrics appointments, interviews for I-130 petitions (forms filed by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor their family members), and interviews for green card applications.

“[T]hese arrests are preventing eligible individuals from being approved for lawful status,” the organization wrote in a policy brief published in August.

“The ICE arrests taking place at USCIS field offices across the country are inefficient, undermine the legal immigration process, and unnecessarily separate families,” the brief continues. “Current ICE actions not only undermine trust in the system but also punish those who are actively trying to comply with the law.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-5-hands-holding-USCIS.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:57:05.528082

The Trump administration’s complaint centers around the doctrine of preemption, which holds that federal law may displace state law if the state law frustrates a purpose or objective of a federal law or inappropriately encroaches on an area that has been specifically reserved for the federal government.

Immigration has consistently been deemed a province of the federal government. For instance, 8 US Code § 1373 states that no official may “prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”

The complaint alleges that the Boston Trust Act “is at cross-purposes with that congressional design,” specifically the portions that preclude local officials from “[p]roviding personal information … regarding a person’s release date or time to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency … solely for the purpose of enforcing civil violations of United States immigration laws.”

A Department of Justice press release condemned Boston’s sanctuary policies—policies that tend to inhibit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said that “[i]f Boston won’t protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.”

In response to Bondi’s letter “threatening to prosecute local officials” for failing to partake in “mass deportations,” Mayor Wu maintained that Boston’s actions are completely consistent with federal law:

The City of Boston follows the law—local, state, and federal. The United States Constitution establishes that local governments, closest to the people, hold the authority to enact public safety policies without the threat of unlawful interference from the federal government.

Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira has lived in the United States for most of his life and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection, according to lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Singleton Schreiber LLP, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence working with the ACLU.

DACA is a status conferred through a 2012 federal law that affords immigrants who were brought to the United States as children protection from being deported for renewable two-year periods.

Gamez Lira is a father of four and married to a United States citizen. According to the lawsuit, as well as surveillance video obtained by news outlet ElPasoYa, masked federal immigrant agents arrested him in his driveway in Horizon City, Texas, on Aug. 13 with two of his children in the car. The arrest resulted in a dislocated shoulder, according to the lawsuit.

NM Gov announces Oct. 1 special session on federal cuts to healthcare, nutrition, public media

The lawsuit filed Wednesday names Homeland Security Kristi Noem and US Attorney General Pam Bondi, along with other federal officials and Dora Castro, the Otero County Processing Center warden. No defendant has yet responded in court.

Earlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS told NPR that DACA recipients “are not automatically protected from deportations” and that they should leave the United States voluntarily.

Gamez Lira is being held at the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico, a facility that houses the majority of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held in New Mexico. The ACLU alleges he faces “indefinite detention” at the facility, according to the news release.

“Paulo has worked hard to build a dignified and meaningful life in the United States. He is a committed father of U.S. citizen children, and this is the only home he has ever known,” said ACLU-NM Senior Staff Attorney Becca Sheff in a statement. “It’s unconscionable for the government to hold Paulo indefinitely in an ICE detention center known for dangerous and degrading conditions, especially since his status as a DACA recipient protects him from being deported.”

Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

The lawyers filed a similar petition on behalf of Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago, another 28-year-old DACA recipient, who has been held in detention in West Texas for more than a month, according to the news release. The petitions allege the detainees are being held in violation of their constitutional rights to due process, along with other violations.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment, saying the agency does not comment on pending federal litigation.

The detention center where Gamez Lira is held has an average daily population of about 850 ICE detainees, according to the latest figures. A group of mostly Republican lawmakers visited the facility recently, part of an effort to push their Democratic colleagues and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham not to ban ICE detention facilities in New Mexico.

What Recent Policy Changes Have Paved the Way for Military Lawyers to Serve as Immigration Judges?
Permanent immigration judges undergo a rigorous training curriculum, which includes at least one year of mentorship with an experienced immigration judge.
Given the short 6-month terms, temporary immigration judges won’t have time to become experts in immigration law.
Second, Congress could improve its oversight of the hiring practices of immigration judges given this new workforce for immigration adjudications.","This week, the Department of Defense (DOD) approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges—which would double the total number of immigration judges at the Department of Justice. This is yet another example of the Trump administration diverting military resources away from national security and instead toward its mass deportation agenda.

Temporary immigration judges are meant to support, not supplant, permanent immigration judges and are only allowed to serve 6-month renewable terms. The DOD’s decision comes days after the DOJ—which oversees the immigration court system—significantly watered down the requirements to serve as a temporary immigration judge.

What Recent Policy Changes Have Paved the Way for Military Lawyers to Serve as Immigration Judges?

On August 28, the DOJ published a final rule that eliminated certain requirements to serve as a temporary immigration judge. Previously, to be a temporary judge, a candidate must have served (1) as a former immigration judge or appellate immigration judge, (2) as an administrative judge within another executive branch agency, or (3) as a DOJ attorney with at least 10 years of immigration law experience.

The Trump administration removed those requirements and now the DOJ can select any attorney to serve as a temporary immigration judge, including military attorneys and attorneys from the private sector with no immigration experience.

The Trump administration claims that more immigration judges are necessary to address the immigration court backlog. But in the past seven months, the Trump administration itself has fired or laid off more than 100 permanent immigration judges—taking the DOJ from a high of 735 judges at the end of FY 2024, to about 600 now.

What Harms Could Result From Reassigning Military Lawyers to Serve as Immigration Judges?

Temporary immigration judges could be more susceptible to political influence than permanent judges. Several recently fired immigration judges have stated that DOJ is telling them how to make decisions in a case, and the Trump administration has terminated judges for not aligning with its mass deportation goals. Given that temporary immigration judges only serve for 6-month renewable terms and are subject to review before any renewal is made, the Trump administration could easily choose to keep only those judges that have ruled the way the administration wants.

Training alone won’t address the problems with appointing unqualified attorneys as temporary immigration judges. The DOJ states in its final rule that temporary immigration judges will be subject to the “same” training as permanent hires, but that’s not enough. Permanent immigration judges undergo a rigorous training curriculum, which includes at least one year of mentorship with an experienced immigration judge. But the immigration system is complex and becoming more complex by the day. Given the short 6-month terms, temporary immigration judges won’t have time to become experts in immigration law.

This diversion of military lawyers further undermines due process. Reassigning military lawyers who lack experience and understanding in immigration law to serve as immigration adjudicators further blurs the line between independent administrative courts and presidential policies. It increases the risk that people facing life-altering consequences of detention and deportation will be deprived of the little due process they are entitled to in immigration proceedings.

What To Look for as Immigration Courts Start Turning to Military Lawyers for Adjudications?

First, lawyers are still examining the legality of this new decision which may result in litigation. The DOD’s decision to allow active-duty military attorneys to serve as immigration judges could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of “any part” of the military to “execute the laws” of the United States.

Second, Congress could improve its oversight of the hiring practices of immigration judges given this new workforce for immigration adjudications. Since 2019, Congress has used the appropriations process to monitor hiring practices of immigration judges, but advocates have proposed strengthening this oversight.

Finally, Congress should ensure that any future reform of the U.S. immigration system includes protections against the politicization of immigration courts we are currently experiencing.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-doj-military-attorney-judge.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 17:57:03.595067

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States, if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Designations are granted for terms of six, twelve or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.

At the South Texas ICE Processing Center, at least four emergency calls since January have reportedly referenced sexual abuse,” the report said.
And because Sen. Ossoff’s investigation of abuses in immigration detention is ongoing, further credible reports are likely to come.
“Records of hundreds of emergency calls from ICE detention centers obtained by WIRED—including audio recordings—show a system inundated by life-threatening incidents, delayed treatment, and overcrowding,” the outlet reported in June.
The Marshall Project newly reports that as the administration is seeking to expand immigration detention, it’s rapidly “raising troubling facilities” with a history of abuses “from the dead” in order to get more space.","“One attorney reported that a U.S. citizen child with severe medical issues was hospitalized three times while in CBP custody with her non-citizen mother, and that when the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report said. But in response, a guard simply said to “just give the girl a cracker.”

An ongoing investigation led by Georgia’s senior senator has uncovered hundreds of credible reports of shocking human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities, including dozens of allegations of physical and sexual abuse and the mistreatment of pregnant women and children as young as two, including U.S. citizens.

The probe, led by Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, details more than 500 credible human rights abuses in immigration detention, including 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse, 32 reports of abuses against pregnant women and kids, reports of denial of health care and legal representation, and even punitive solitary confinement – which is considered torture by many experts – for reporting allegations at facilities in more than two dozen states, Puerto Rico, and even U.S. military bases in Cuba and as far away as Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.

“Public reports describe at least two 911 calls from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California referencing reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults. At the South Texas ICE Processing Center, at least four emergency calls since January have reportedly referenced sexual abuse,” the report said. At the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas, one detained individual was slammed so hard against the ground “for stepping out of line in the dining hall” that guards “reportedly nearly broke his wrists.”

Both the Adelanto ICE Processing Center and the South Texas ICE Processing Center are operated by GEO Group, one of a number of private prisons set to reap massive profits under the administration’s anti-immigrant dragnet. And they’ve made perfectly clear they know on which side their bread is buttered. GEO Group was the first corporation to max out to Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, and subsequently used a subsidiary to donate a combined $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC.

The human misery that now fills the pockets of private prison executives aligned with the agenda of the administration has not spared the most vulnerable, either.

“The partner of a woman in DHS custody reported to the Senator’s staff that the woman was pregnant and bled for days before facility staff would take her to a hospital,” the report said. “Once she was there, she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours. In another case, a detainee reportedly ‘nearly miscarried twice’ while in ICE custody.”

“One attorney reported that a U.S. citizen child with severe medical issues was hospitalized three times while in CBP custody with her non-citizen mother, and that when the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report continued. But in response, a guard simply said to “just give the girl a cracker.” In this disturbing pattern targeting sick children, a four-year-old child receiving ongoing treatment for cancer was also detained and subsequently deported “without the ability to consult a doctor.”

“Detainees have reported being beaten by detention facility staff and placed in solitary confinement after reporting their abuse,” the report said. The intent is clear. Human rights experts have stated that solitary confinement is tantamount to torture and can even be lethal.

And because Sen. Ossoff’s investigation of abuses in immigration detention is ongoing, further credible reports are likely to come. But as the report notes, Congressional oversight seeking to shine a light on these abuses has been impeded by the administration, which has sought to unlawfully block lawmakers from doing their jobs, as a recent lawsuit from members of Congress states. The administration claims that members must give at least 72 hours notice of any visits, but that’s entirely made up. Federal law permits them to visit unannounced as part of their oversight responsibilities.

“Regardless of our views on immigration policy, the American people do not support the abuse of detainees and prisoners,” Sen. Ossoff told NBC News, adding that “it’s more important than ever to shine a light on what’s happening behind bars and barbed wire, especially and most shockingly to children.”

Other recent reports show that abuses within immigration detention are part of an escalating pattern under Trump and mass deportation architect-in-chief Stephen Miller’s crusade to purge the country of non-white people. “Records of hundreds of emergency calls from ICE detention centers obtained by WIRED—including audio recordings—show a system inundated by life-threatening incidents, delayed treatment, and overcrowding,” the outlet reported in June.

“The data, obtained through public records requests, show that at least 60 percent of the centers analyzed had reported serious pregnancy complications, suicide attempts, or sexual assault allegations,” WIRED reported. “Since January, these 10 facilities have collectively placed nearly 400 emergency calls. Nearly 50 of those have involved potential cardiac episodes, 26 referenced seizures, and 17 reported head injuries. Seven calls described suicide attempts or self-harm, including overdoses and hangings. Six others involved allegations of sexual abuse—including at least one case logged as ‘staff on detainee.’”

And the following month, visiting lawmakers decried Florida’s Everglades detention camp and described the site as an “internment camp” where immigrants have been “packed” into what are essentially human holding pens. “Wall-to-wall humans. 32 detainees per cage,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25). Another visiting lawmaker, Rep. Maxwell Frost (FL-10), called conditions at the detention camp abhorrent. “When those doors opened .. what I saw made my heart sink.”

Following landmark legal action led by environmental and indigenous groups, a federal judge “banned the arrival of new detainees and ordered a winding down of operations within 60 days,” Friends of the Everglades said. However, an appeals court has since put that order on hold. Litigation around the detention camp remains ongoing as reporting has revealed that as Floridians continue to struggle with living costs, their state wasted more than $200 million on the project.

But as the end of one inhumane detention site could possibly be within reach, others are popping up in its place. The Marshall Project newly reports that as the administration is seeking to expand immigration detention, it’s rapidly “raising troubling facilities” with a history of abuses “from the dead” in order to get more space.

“In Louisiana, where many immigrants arrested across the country are being held, the state closed several prisons after sentencing and parole reform allowed it to shrink the incarcerated population,” the report said. “But those empty buildings were repurposed, and now, seven of the nine ICE facilities there are former local prisons or jails.” And it means more money for private prison profiteers. In rural Michigan, one reopened detention site is being operated by GEO Group. “I think the rapidity of that reopening does speak to the chaotic environment that we always associate with the GEO Group and how they cut corners, and above all, they want to make money,” No Detention Centers in Michigan member JR Martin told The Marshall Project.",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/engin-akyurt-XJp8R7wimhg-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:57:11.677199

The courts are playing a central role in opposing the lawless Trump administration, but the core of the resistance are people–people at every level organized in opposition, defending democracy.","US President Donald Trump is on a losing streak this week. Just look at the latest judicial decisions challenging his policies, from mass deportations to tariffs to his troop deployments to US cities.

The courts are proving to be a significant check on Trump’s thirst for absolute power.

These cases illustrate the point:

Immigration

Over Labor Day weekend, Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to begin deporting up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. In the dead of night, the first children were loaded onto planes in south Texas. “These are unaccompanied children who do not have a parent or a guardian with them,” Efrén Olivares, an attorney representing the minors, said on the Democracy Now! news hour.

At 1:00 am on Sunday morning, Olivares and his colleagues filed an emergency complaint with the federal court in Washington, DC. Judge Sparkle Sooknanam was woken after 2:00 am, and by 4:00 am she issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations until the children had the immigration hearings to which they have a legal right.

Meanwhile in Texas, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation’s most conservative, ruled that Trump’s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport people was illegal.

Tariffs

The Appeals Court in Washington DC ruled that Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were illegal and unconstitutional, noting that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs. The ruling was “a sweeping decision that unequivocally rebukes President Trump’s idea that he can impose tariffs on American consumers on his own,” Neal Katyal, the attorney who argued the case, said on Democracy Now!

Domestic Deployment of the Military

Trump says, “We’re going in,” threatening to invade Chicago using, among other forces, the Texas National Guard.

But in California, a federal judge, invoking the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act that bars the use of military in domestic law enforcement, ruled in favor of Gov. Gavin Newsom, finding Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles, along with several hundred US Marines, was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of retired US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from “deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops [from] engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

These are just a few of the recent court cases that have rebuked Trump as he attempts to subvert the US Constitution.

We recently got a personal glimpse into what judicial wins over Trump look like. In the high mountain air of Telluride, Colorado, we had a chance to spend time with E. Jean Carroll, the renowned advice columnist and journalist. She was at the Telluride Film Festival for the premier of the new documentary, Ask E. Jean.

Carroll had a long and storied career as the advice columnist for Elle Magazine, and has published several books. In recent years she became known as one of the most prominent women to accuse Donald Trump of sexual abuse, saying he raped her in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s, in Manhattan.

The courts are playing a central role in opposing the lawless Trump administration, but the core of the resistance are people.

Carroll sued Trump in civil court, and a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing her. Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote, “Trump did in fact ‘rape’ Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood.” She was awarded a $5 million settlement from Trump. After the verdict, he called her a liar. She then sued for defamation, and won an additional jury award of $83.3 million.

Carroll cut an elegant figure, walking along Telluride’s main avenue with the sweeping Continental Divide as a backdrop. Her film premiered to rave reviews, and, should there remain a film distributor in this country not cowed by threats of lawsuits from Trump, it should be available for viewing by a wide audience. The film highlights the story of one courageous woman refusing to be defined as a victim of Donald Trump, providing inspiration, no doubt, to the hundreds of survivors of Trump’s old friend, the now-dead sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. Many of them spoke this week outside the US Capitol, demanding the full release of the Epstein files. The Trump administration, which controls the files, is resisting.

Behind each lawsuit are impacted people, whether immigrant children pulled from their beds in the middle of the night and thrown on planes, or people standing up in the streets of LA confronting illegally deployed troops, whether sexual abuse survivors banding together, or federal workers fired en masse.

Politicians have warned of ramped up U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement efforts in the coming days, with federal agents expected to use the Naval Station Great Lakes on the North Shore and an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview.

Meanwhile, Chicago's popular El Grito fest was postponed over heightened concerns surrounding the enforcement efforts and Mexican Independence Day celebration organizers are on high alert following reports their events could be targeted.

Here's what we know so far:

Who is coming to Chicago?

National Guard

Despite a public back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the potential for National Guard deployment in Chicago, no official calls have been made so far.

Local

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott denied reports National Guard members from his state will be traveling to Chicago, contradicting comments from Pritzker earlier this week.

Pritzker had reportedly said ""we have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois."" But Abbott’s administration pushed back on those comments Wednesday, saying the state’s National Guard is not preparing for a deployment, while arguing that Pritzker and members of the Chicago City Council are “not in the loop” on any plans for federal intervention.

“Governor Abbott and the State of Texas are ready, willing, and able to deploy all necessary resources to clean up the streets of Chicago should President Trump call upon us to do so,” a spokesperson for Abbott told NBC Chicago.

Trump on Wednesday took a step back from talk of sending the National Guard to Chicago, saying Pritzker would have to ask for the assistance. The governor bluntly dismissed such an idea.

There is still a chance the president could pivot and attempt to send National Guard members to the city without a request from Pritzker, but President Donald Trump told reporters this week that he wanted to wait for such a call to come.

Trump had suggested during a Wednesday press conference that he would potentially explore sending National Guard members to Louisiana instead, but Pritzker said he has not seen any news of a redirection.

ICE

While the National Guard may not be deployed to Chicago, enhanced federal immigration enforcement operations are still expected.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village's roughly 8,000 residents that federal officials said a two-story building at 1930 Beach St. will be used for a ""large-scale"" immigration enforcement campaign led by the Trump administration. The campaign is set to last for approximately 45 days.

The letter also warned residents that protests and demonstrations near the building, ""like those seen earlier this year in Los Angeles, where property damage and assaults against law enforcement were reported,"" could occur.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

Immigration attorneys have previously told NBC Chicago that during the last round of scaled up ICE enforcement, it was difficult to make contact with their clients at the facility.

According to Pritzker, increased ICE enforcement in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs could begin as early as this weekend.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago.""

At least 300 federal agents expected to come to the Great Lakes Naval Base in North Chicago as part of the Trump Administration's enhanced operations from ICE, Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said.

A joint statement from the Lake County Government and the City of North Chicago Wednesday called the planned federal operations at the Naval Station ""unprecedented.""

""If the agents are stationed here in Lake County and they say they're going to be in Chicago, who's to say they won't come in to our community?,"" Rockingham Jr. said, who added that the community is approximately 40 percent Latino.

Pritzker said agents could be fully assembled by Friday, with operations beginning Saturday, though his office hasn't received official communication from the White House.

Last week, a report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

Mayor Rockingham said the agents will not be staying at the base, and will be housed at hotels in Lake County.

Protests begin

Protesters gathered Friday morning outside the Broadview ICE facility , calling for its closure.

The protests, which began at 7 a.m., featured groups citing the Illinois Way Forward Act.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,"" village administrator LeTisa Jones told the Associated Press. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

As of 7:15 a.m., several protesters had begun to gather in front of the center, with more arriving as the morning went on, some with signs, and a small police presence.

Mexican Independence Day celebrations

During his Tuesday press conference, Pritzker said he was ""deeply concerned"" that ICE will target Mexican Independence Day.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

In Chicago, organizers with El Grito, a popular Mexican Independence Day event slated for Sept. 13 and 14 in Grant Park, moved to postpone the festival due to the concerns.

""This was a painful decision; however, with the heightened political tensions and given our location in downtown Chicago, we need to keep our community safe,"" organizer German Gonzalez said in a statement Thursday. ""To proceed in spite of the advice we've received directly from city and state officials and potentially expose our community to becoming collateral damage would be irresponsible. That's a risk we are not willing to take.""

The city's iconic parade, however, remains planned as scheduled.

""The city of Chicago will celebrate the independence of Mexico the way it has done in the past,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson said. ""I know the president is working hard to intimidate, I’m not intimidated. No one should be.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/IMG_4807.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-05 18:57:07.897944

Given the backlog of pending removal cases, it’s time the immigration courts got some relief, but ignore any complaints you may hear about how complex immigration law is or any potential threats this plan may pose to “due process”.

A Historical Perspective on the Backlog

Having been an immigration judge myself, I am intimately familiar with this system.

When I left the bench to return to Capitol Hill in FY 2015, there were 254 immigration judges handling a docket of 659,000 cases — roughly 2,600 cases per immigration judge.

When Donald Trump took office in FY 2017, there were 84 more immigration judges on the bench, and they were handling nearly 896,000 cases — just about 2,650 cases each.

The then-president and his attorneys general (Jeff Sessions, Matt Whittaker, and Bill Barr) prioritized immigration judge hiring, and when Trump left office in FY 2021, the cadre of immigration judges had risen 65 percent to 559.

So far, so good, but the problem was that the immigration court backlog rose by 85 percent during that same period, to more than 1.655 million cases.

Immigration court shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the increase, but other factors, including a rush of alien adults travelling illegally with children to take advantage of misguided court decisions (mis)interpreting the Flores settlement agreement, drove the problem.

Then came the Biden administration, with its (illegal) quick-release policies for migrants who entered illegally and weren’t expelled under Title 42.

Most were placed into removal proceedings, and by FY 2024, the immigration court backlog had grown to more than 3.88 million cases — a 135 percent increase in just three years.

I’ll note Biden continued that first Trump-era hiring spree, but still, the 735 immigration judges on the bench at the end of FY 2024 faced average dockets of 5,286 cases each.

Keep in mind also that the backlog would have been even worse had the Biden administration not cooked the books by dismissing, terminating, or closing 700,000 pending cases involving facially removable aliens, a move the House Judiciary Committee termed a “quiet amnesty”.

That may have been good on paper, but it was plainly not in the best interests of the American people.

Impact of the Trump II Border Shutdown

Trump returned to office vowing to shut the border down, and assigned two veteran officials — “border czar” Tom Homan and CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott — to accomplish that task.

And by July, Homan, Scott, and thousands of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers attained “operational control” of the Southwest border, as agency encounters dropped 92 percent compared to December.

That decline in illegal entries took some of the heat off the immigration courts, and by the third quarter of FY 2025, the backlog had declined for the first time in 17 years (since FY 2008) as immigration judges completed more than 588,000 cases while receiving just more than 448,000.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”

The immigration courts have been under-resourced for all 33-plus years that I have been involved in this area, but Congress acted in H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) to address that gap.

In section 100054 of the OBBBA, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the DOJ component that administers the immigration courts, received $3.33 billion designated for the hiring of immigration judges and necessary support staff “to address the backlog of petitions, cases, and removals”.

That appropriation, however, came with an inexplicable restriction in paragraph (1)(B): “Effective November 1, 2028, [EOIR] shall be comprised of not more than 800 immigration judges, along with the necessary support staff.”

I say “inexplicable” because nobody can explain why there’s any cap on immigration judges. If anything, Congress should put a floor on hiring EOIR adjudicators, but for now, that limitation is the law.

“Designation of Temporary Immigration Judges”

As noted above, the backlog has declined in the past nine months, but the average immigration judge must still juggle a docket of more than 5,500 cases — a herculean task given that each can complete, at best, only 1,000 cases per year.

In response, EOIR on August 28 published a final rule in the Federal Register captioned “Designation of Temporary Immigration Judges”. As the office explains, under that rule: “the EOIR Director ... with the approval of the Attorney General, may designate or select TIJs, which have the authority of an IJ to adjudicate assigned cases and administer immigration court matters”. (TIJs are not counted toward the inexplicable 800-judge cap in the OBBBA.)

The appointment of TIJs has been permitted by regulation since the Obama administration, but prior to the current rule, the only attorneys eligible were former immigration judges, members of the appellate Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), ALJs — administrative law judges — from DOJ and other agencies, and DOJ attorneys with at least 10 years of immigration law experience.

That latter requirement really didn’t make any sense, given that full-fledged immigration judges only need seven years of post-bar experience — not 10 — and any lawyer could apply and be appointed, not just one with immigration experience.

The thought in 2014 when that earlier provision took effect was that many TIJs would want to become immigration judges.

But as the rule explains: “EOIR’s experience with its retired adjudicators, only a handful of whom have indicated a willingness to return as either TIJs or rehired annuitants with limited workloads since the 2014 [regulation] was promulgated indicates that pool is insufficient to address its TIJ needs”.

Consequently, the August 28 rule drops both the immigration-law experience requirement and expands TIJ-eligibility to attorneys from other departments — not just DOJ.

“Pentagon Authorizes Up to 600 Military Lawyers to Serve as Temporary Immigration Judges”

Which brings me to the September 2 AP article, headlined “Pentagon authorizes up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges”.

The outlet reports: “The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department ‘as soon as practicable,’ and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week.’”

Once on the bench, that assignment would boost the current number of immigration judges by about 22 percent, but don’t expect any of them to start hearing cases before late October.

As the August 28 rule notes, DOJ must first approve any would-be TIJs, and once they’re selected, they’ll “receive the same ‘comprehensive, continuing training and support’” that full-time immigration judges already get.

In my case, that meant a week-long course in immigration law and courtroom demeanor, followed by two weeks of in-court experience supervised by a full-time immigration judge.

Trust me — it was more than enough, and attorneys in my class who came in with no immigration-law experience have gone on to have distinguished careers.

“Makes as Much Sense as Having a Cardiologist Do a Hip Replacement”

Nonetheless, AP quoted a critic who complained Defense Department TIJs would “gut[] due process” and that the plan “makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement”.

Spare me. First, though immigration law experts compare the subject to tax law in its complexity, in most cases it’s straightforward and commonsensical.

Aliens enter illegally or they don’t, overstay nonimmigrant visas or they don’t, are telling you the truth about the horrors they faced back home or the relationship they have with their “spouses”, or they aren’t.

By and large, rules of evidence don’t even come into play in immigration court, and when it comes to bond hearings, multiple layers of hearsay and innuendo are fair game.

And if immigration judges — full-time or temporary — have any questions about the law or the facts, they can tell the parties to brief them. When I was an INS trial attorney, I usually hated such requests, but as an immigration judge I thought they were swell — and immensely helpful.

As for “due process”, immigration judges are first adjudicators, not the last. Every alien can have an immigration court decision reviewed by the BIA, and if they aren’t happy there, can ask the local federal circuit court to weigh in — and both tribunals are more than happy to send a wrongly decided case back or reverse a decision.

Even the cariologist/hip surgeon comparison is inapt.

The doctor’s adage “see one, do one, teach one” was coined by Dr. William Stewart Halsted at Johns Hopkins in the late 19th century when he was training young, would-be surgeons. Under the latest rule, TIJs will see many immigration cases — and likely do many under supervision as well — before the training wheels come off.

Moreover, while it’s true that I wouldn’t grab cardiologists from the cath lab and have them cut on me, immigration law isn’t surgery — and if I thought I was having a heart attack, I’d trust an orthopedist to diagnose my symptoms.

Respectfully, there are plenty of Article III, federal court judges with no experience at the outset in the varied areas of the law they are expected to adjudicate. To the best of my knowledge, no Supreme Court justice in history ever practiced immigration law, but they have the final word in interpreting it.

Finally, as the August 28 Federal Register notice notes, “Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success as an” immigration judge; trust me when I tell you from experience, truer words have never been spoken.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/judge-gavel-warrant-social.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:20.070722

President Trump has been mentioning the effort for weeks as part of his broadening immigration enforcement across the country, which aims to arrest people in cities including Chicago that typically don’t coordinate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Recently, Mr. Trump has described Chicago as a “mess,” the latest volley at a city that he has long criticized for its Democratic leadership and crime rate. He has already sent federal agents and troops to Los Angeles and Washington, and has said the moves are necessary to fight street crime and enforce immigration laws.

An internal document obtained by The New York Times indicated that Department of Homeland Security officials would arrive at the Naval Station Great Lakes this week and that there would be 30 days of operations in the Chicago area. In recent weeks, ICE officials have sought significant resources for the operation, including thousands of handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, as well as a number of gas masks, license plate readers and buses, according to an official with knowledge of the plans.

In Chicago, at least 150,000 people in the city of 2.7 million are undocumented, estimates show, making up about 8 percent of households.

Both political leaders and residents say they are uncertain what exactly is about to take place.

Hundreds of Chicago residents have vowed to gather in protest downtown at the first sign of ICE raids, and metal barricades were placed around the federal courthouse on Thursday night in the heart of the Loop.

In the suburbs north of Chicago on Friday morning, protesters unfurled banners in opposition to ICE along on a highway that leads from a naval station that is being used as a staging ground for the federal government’s operations.

Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said that his administration was ready to fight Mr. Trump in court if the president expanded the operations beyond immigration and ordered National Guard troops to enter the city. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to send troops to Chicago, saying that policing in the city needs federal help. But violent crime has dropped there in the last several years, and city officials said this summer recorded the fewest homicides since 1965.

Chicagoans, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants, have been anxiously monitoring news of the federal involvement. Some say they fear they could be arrested and deported.

“We are all afraid, but we also feel a sense of resignation,” said Francisco, a Mexican man who asked that his full name not be used because he was not authorized to be in the country. He said he had been working in Chicago as a janitor, cleaning offices and stadiums since 2010.

Immigration officials have been under increasing pressure to make more arrests and deport a growing number of people to fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations.

In Illinois, ICE has made at least 1,400 immigration arrests since Mr. Trump took office through the end of July, a much lower rate per capita than in other immigrant-heavy states like New York. More than a thousand of those arrests have been in the Chicago area

The operation in Chicago is expected to be particularly challenging for ICE. ICE officials have found difficulties in the past in progressive communities where advocates have advised people not to answer their doors to immigration officers seeking their arrest. Officials are also on alert for potential protest activity.

The anticipated crackdown coincided with a typically raucous time in the city as celebrations of Mexican Independence Day were to begin on Saturday with a parade in the Little Village neighborhood on the Southwest Side. Most Latinos in Chicago are of Mexican descent, and each year, thousands attend parades, fly Mexican flags from their cars and form caravans, honking horns and causing gridlock around the city.

The holiday was expected to be muted this year because of the prospect of federal law enforcement. Some organizers said they would cancel events altogether. El Grito Chicago, a two-day musical festival set to take place in mid-September in Grant Park, the city’s front yard, was postponed.

“It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake, and that’s a risk we are unwilling to take,” organizers said in a statement.

Chicago Public Schools has also been monitoring the situation with alarm.

Latinos make up nearly half of the city’s public school system’s 325,000 students, and some administrators worry that families will choose to keep their children home out of caution. Most of Chicago’s 800,000 Latino residents are legally in this country, but advocates say they worry that families will still fear being caught up in raids even if they have legal status.

Teachers planned to hold “solidarity walk-ins” on Friday, handing out brochures to parents or passers-by with details on their legal rights, should they be confronted by ICE agents.

In the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday morning, several dozen people showed up at an ICE processing facility in protest.

The group included some holding a prayer vigil and others carrying signs and chanting “all power to the people, no one is illegal.” Some members of the group have been protesting outside the facility weekly for almost two decades

The windows and the front door of the facility, a two-story building on a quiet, industrial street, were recently covered with plywood. Asked about the reason for the plywood, ICE officials did not provide an explanation.

City leaders encouraged protest against what they have described as a military occupation, but urged a peaceful, nonviolent reaction.

Former Representative Luis Gutiérrez, a Democrat, stood in Federal Plaza downtown on Thursday and denounced the Trump administration, while acknowledging that a violent response from the public could spur the president to bring in the National Guard.

“Lift your voice but not your hand,” Mr. Gutiérrez said. “The only one who wins when there is violence is Donald Trump, because he wins by saying that the people of the city of Chicago need the National Guard because it is a city of violence.”

Protests and incidents of arson over ICE arrests in Los Angeles led Mr. Trump to send thousands of National Guard members into the city over the summer.

Support for Mr. Trump’s plans for Chicago has been quiet in the city, relative to the opposition. But some Chicagoans said they would welcome troops to enforce the laws in their neighborhoods.

Wanda Williams, 49, sat on a bench in Federal Plaza on Friday. She said that while she was not in favor of deportations, she would not be upset if Mr. Trump brought in the National Guard to contend with problems other than immigration.

“I say bring them, I’m sick of the crime,” said Ms. Williams, a resident of the Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side, where she said drug sales were common on her block.

On the streets of Pilsen and Little Village — neighborhoods known for sizable Mexican American populations — immigrant residents, some undocumented and others with varying degrees of legal status, said they had closely followed the news of the crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington and feared that Chicago could become the next target. Many had long ago started limiting their outings to banks and grocery stores and not leaving home without first scanning TikTok or Facebook, or “el Feis,” as most called it, for sightings of immigration agents.

One 14-year-old girl waiting for the bus in the Pilsen neighborhood said her undocumented parents, like those of many of her friends, were scared to go outside over the next few days. Rumors of raids were already proliferating online, some complained, putting only more stress on communities already on edge. The National Guard seemed to be on everyone’s mind.

Maricela, 50, who declined to use her full name because she was undocumented, said the constant sense of worry and nervousness could be damaging to peoples’ health.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/NAT-CHICAGO-BRACING-1-qpzw/NAT-CHICAGO-BRACING-1-qpzw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:56:48.492202

Whether detaining a Turkish student on the street in Boston, raiding Home Depot parking lots in Los Angeles or, now, arresting immigrants on the streets of the capital, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in tactical gear and with their faces obscured have become a strange new national pageant.

The Homeland Security Department says that in an era of extreme polarization and rising political violence, masks are necessary. “ICE officers wear a mask because they’ve been doxxed by the thousands,” Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, told my colleagues at “The Daily.” “Their families have been doxxed. ICE officers’ pictures show up on trees and telephone poles. Death threats are sky-high.” Masking, the argument goes, is simply the practical response.

Lawmakers in liberal states say the practice should be banned, and this summer, Democratic elected officials in California, New York and Pennsylvania proposed laws to do just that. At the end of July, Virginia’s Democratic senators introduced a bill to ban the use of masks nationally. The issue also got the attention of a federal judge, who, in a ruling on Tuesday against Mr. Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles, noted disapprovingly that the armed forces’ identity “was often obscured by protective armor.”

As I watched all of this, I found myself wondering about masking by law enforcement and whether it has a history in the United States. Something about it seemed at once familiar and foreign. That’s because I associate the practice with Russia.

In the summer of 2000, when President Vladimir Putin had just taken office, I was living in Moscow and working as a reporter. At the time, the first battle lines were being drawn between the new president and the powerful oligarchs he hoped to tame. Russians began to see raids by government forces on oligarchs and their properties. Men in masks conducted them. They became so ubiquitous that people began referring to them sardonically as Maski Show, or mask shows, after a popular television show involving mask-wearing clowns.

The United States is not Russia. But as I search for ways to understand what is happening in my country today, I am looking to the places I’ve been before. In Russia in the 2000s, I thought of masking as a peculiar feature of a wobbly post-Soviet state. Over time it became clear that it was a harbinger of a new era.

The Power and the Danger

Masks became a feature of America’s fiercely polarized political life during the Covid pandemic. Mask requirements enraged conservatives, who saw them as an effort by the government to boss them around on flimsy science. Concerns about the virus’s spread subsided, but the debate seemed to have unlocked something in the American psyche about the power — and danger — of masks.

Over the past several years, states and counties began passing laws against masking that applied to protesters in demonstrations, reasoning that they would be more likely to do something illegal if law enforcement couldn’t see their faces.

Some of those laws echoed statutes passed in the 1940s and 1950s by states and cities that were trying to control the Ku Klux Klan, said Robert Mickey, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. Even though Klan chapters were often “shot through with members of the police,” Mr. Mickey said, those officers, who showed their faces during the day, wore masks when doing the work of the Klan at night.

There are good reasons vigilantes wear masks and police officers don’t. Policing experts argue that masking by law enforcement is wrong because officers are public servants and are supposed to be accountable to the public. Hiding behind a mask makes that harder. Yes, officers’ jobs can be dangerous, but being publicly identifiable goes along with having the right to wield a deadly weapon on behalf of the state.

In recent years in the United States, trends in law enforcement were moving in the opposite direction. Many police departments now use body cameras and require that the officer’s badge, with name and number, be visible.

Michael German, a retired F.B.I. agent who is now a fellow in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, said that even when he worked undercover, “the period of secrecy ended when charges were brought and I had to defend what I had done in that undercover capacity.”

Masking provides leeway for abuse, he said. People tend to be more scrupulous and vigilant when they can be personally held accountable for their actions. A mask allows more latitude for sloppiness or shortcuts — a punch or a kick, for example.

No one I interviewed could think of an example of American law enforcement masking. Jules Epstein, a law professor at Temple University who worked for decades as a criminal defense lawyer and death penalty litigator, said that in his more than 45 years of practice, he had never seen the police wear masks, including in high-profile gang cases.

‘Without Question a Bad Sign’

Outside the United States, masking by law enforcement has a long history. When it happens, it tends to be in countries with weak central governments, sometimes ones that are fighting insurgencies or drug cartels or, for that matter, political opponents.

In Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s, the government worked with paramilitary groups — forces on the side of the government but not directly employed by it — that often wore masks. They operated at the margins of the law, according to Adam Isacson, a security expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, and over time, courts and special tribunals have documented abuses they perpetrated. In Colombia, the state was up against a well-equipped and deadly foe: drug cartels. Anyone obstructing them had reason to fear for their lives. Judges wore masks to avoid reprisal killings, a practice that became known as “judges without faces.”

Law enforcement officers in Mexico sometimes mask, too, Mr. Isacson said, in areas where drug cartels have a strong presence.

In Peru, government forces often wore masks in their war against Shining Path guerrillas in the 1980s and 1990s, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist who has studied Latin America and written about democratic decline. In areas where Shining Path was strongest, police officers were afraid of reprisals by the guerrillas but also of becoming pariahs in their own communities for abuses they themselves committed, he said.

More recently, Human Rights Watch has documented cases of government forces using masks in Venezuela during the repression that followed the country’s tainted presidential election last year. And in the Philippines, victims of Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal antidrug campaign report that the people doing the killing were sometimes masked.

“The use of masks,” Mr. Levitsky said, “is without question a bad sign.”

And it is extremely rare in functional democracies. “I cannot think of a democratic country with a reliable rule of law where security forces mask themselves,” Mr. Levitsky said. “It just doesn’t happen.”

Stronger, more confident regimes rarely mask. Totalitarian states that have established control over their populations tend to avoid moves that would stir dissent. Masking can draw attention to the fact that the government is up to something it wants to hide, or that it is not powerful enough to protect its own forces. In short, it’s a bad look.

In China, the security forces do not wear masks, said Lynette Ong, a China scholar and professor at the University of Toronto. But something else happens. In her book, “Outsourcing Repression,” Ms. Ong explains that China’s everyday security policing force draws from ordinary people mobilized from the street and paid a daily rate or hired on a contract. The state does not formally employ them, and when they are caught harming someone, the government can plausibly say it was not responsible. China may be authoritarian, she said, but public officials can be held accountable for abuse. They can be fired, for example, if their forces are caught on camera beating people up.

Masks are rare in Iran, too, though they are occasionally used in drug and organized crime operations, said Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist who is now an Iran expert at DAWN, a Washington-based organization focused on U.S. policy in the Middle East. He said that when he was arrested in 2005, no one, not even his interrogators, wore masks.

“The people who interrogated me, they wanted me to see their faces,” Mr. Memarian said.

The reason was that the government wanted to show that what it was doing was legitimate. They also arrested him discreetly, “without a splash,” Mr. Memarian said. A number of armed men came to his building, but his neighbors had no idea it was happening. They kept it low-key so as not to draw the attention of regime critics.

“Once a mask is involved,” he said, “people understand it as a sign of weakness, that the government has something to hide.”

The Show

In Russia in the early 2000s, Mr. Putin wasn’t trying to hide anything. On the contrary: He was putting on a show that he wanted everyone to see. Russia’s central government had been plagued by weakness throughout the 1990s, with the oligarchs running official agencies and having their way with the state. The Maski Shows were efforts by this new leader to turn the tables.

One of the most famous episodes took place a few days after Mr. Putin was inaugurated in May 2000. Armed men in military fatigues and masks showed up at one of the offices that belonged to the oligarch who had founded the first independent television network, NTV.

Yevgeny Kiselyov, then the director of the channel and its main anchor, remembers being struck by the over-the-top nature of the force. “They were carrying out their operation as if this building was full of heavily armed terrorists,” he said in an interview. In reality, it was middle-aged women working in accounting.

The television station was eventually taken over by the state, and Mr. Kiselyov now lives outside Russia. He said the meaning of the raid was clear even then. It was a public message, not just to that station and its owner, but to anyone who opposed Mr. Putin. “It was an act of intimidation,” he said. “It was saying, ‘We are now in power, and we are going after you.’”

The Trump administration seems to be sending the same message with ICE, except in this case, the targets are not oligarchs, but immigrants and the businesses who employ them.

But there are other audiences. Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas, who helped oversee border security in the George W. Bush administration, said he believes the performance is aimed at would-be migrants around the world. Former President Joe Biden, “no matter what he did, could not change the view of the world that the border was open,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “I knew it was going to take someone who was going to create some heartache, and that they’d have to be very tough and create some fear to change the circumstances.”

And then there’s the domestic audience. Polling suggests that many Americans don’t like Mr. Trump’s tactics around deportations, at least when it comes to immigrants who have not committed violent crimes. But some Americans do approve of it, perhaps drawn to its dark spectacle. The immigrant detention center in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is now tied up in court battles, has its own merch. Americans pose for selfies by the center’s new highway sign and post them on social media. In early August, Indiana announced a partnership with the Homeland Security Department to build the “Speedway Slammer,” its answer to Alligator Alcatraz. A few weeks later, Nebraska announced plans for the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Mr. Levitsky called the highly visible, almost ostentatious use of masks “a performance but with real-world consequences.” “MAGA seems to get something out of playing authoritarian,” he said. “There’s an element of cosplay to it.”

Perhaps the most important audience of all is the agency itself — and its potential recruits. ICE says it wants to hire 10,000 new agents at a time when hiring law enforcement officers has been hard. It got a multibillion-dollar cash infusion from Congress in July. Masking could serve to reassure reluctant applicants, who are worried for their safety or about being judged by people they know, but also to attract more exuberant ones, who see masking as subversive and fun.

In August, the Homeland Security Department posted on social media an image in the style of the TV show “South Park” that showed a caravan of cartoon figures riding in ICE cars. Their faces were all covered from the nose down.

The president and his supporters see the influx of agents and soldiers as a means to curb crime and crack down on illegal immigration. Critics say Mr. Trump is using the deployments to punish Democratic-led cities and spread fear in immigrant communities. The move has prompted lawsuits, demonstrations and a scramble among local officials to respond.

Here’s how the federal presence on the streets has unfolded so far in some cities, and here’s how it may soon play out elsewhere.

Chicago

The Trump administration is making plans for escalated arrests of undocumented immigrants, using hundreds of federal agents who are being sent to the Chicago area. They are expected to use a naval base outside of the city as a staging area for operations. Local officials and immigrant advocacy groups are on high alert, reminding residents of their rights and urging caution.

Whether Mr. Trump will send the National Guard into Chicago is murky.

In Washington, D.C., the president deployed the National Guard as part of his security takeover there. But Washington is a federal district and not a state, and governors normally have control of their state Guard troops. Mr. Trump bypassed state control in California, where he federalized National Guard troops and sent them to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom. In Illinois, however, there has been no civil unrest in Chicago that might require National Guard assistance.

For weeks, Illinois officials have loudly objected to the Trump administration’s rumored plans, holding news conferences and rallies to make their position clear: They do not want the military in Chicago.

Mr. Johnson issued an order saying that the city would pursue “all available legal and legislative avenues” to resist actions by the federal government “that violate the rights of the City and its residents, including the Constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest and the right to due process.”

Advocacy groups are making plans to stage protests in opposition to any escalated immigration arrests, or the potential presence of the National Guard.

Los Angeles

Federal immigration agents carried out large-scale immigration raids in the Los Angeles area on June 6, including one at a clothing wholesaler in downtown Los Angeles that led to the arrests of dozens of people.

Since the raids began, more than 5,000 undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The raids have been met with backlash from local leaders and residents. Federal immigration agencies, including the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have said that agents are conducting targeted operations. But videos of many raids taken by bystanders and activists and posted on social media have shown agents chasing down people seemingly at random at Home Depot parking lots, carwashes and other workplaces.

At least two people have died after trying to flee immigration agents in Southern California. One man died in July after falling more than 30 feet from a greenhouse at a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County. In August, another man died after being struck by a vehicle while running onto a freeway near Los Angeles as he was trying to flee agents at a Home Depot.

Protests immediately erupted in Los Angeles on the first day of widespread immigration raids in June. The protests spread from downtown Los Angeles to Compton and across the region.

The protests prompted President Trump to send thousands of National Guard members into Los Angeles. Many of those soldiers have since been withdrawn, but about 300 remain. The deployment has cost taxpayers nearly $120 million so far, Mr. Newsom said.

The raids, protests and military presence have led to several legal battles.

One lawsuit was filed against the federal government over the Guard deployment. Another was filed against the Department of Homeland Security, accusing federal agents of stopping people based on the color of their skin. That lawsuit prompted a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order, barring agents from making indiscriminate stops. The ruling was upheld by an appeals court.

The operations in Los Angeles have been led by Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol chief known for confrontational tactics and aggressive raids. It was unclear if Mr. Bovino would join the immigration crackdown in Chicago, but in a video posted on Tuesday on social media, Mr. Bovino suggested that Border Patrol officers were headed to a new city.

“We’re going to trade these palm trees,” he said, “for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues.”

Washington, D.C.

President Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington in August in an effort to crack down on crime, despite figures that indicated a recent drop in crime rates in the area.

In two weeks, federal agents helped arrest about 1,000 people. A New York Times review of the arrests found that the operation appeared to be more of a dragnet than a targeted effort. In addition to those arrests, agents also arrested more than 400 other people who were believed to be undocumented in a three-week time frame.

New Orleans, Mr. Trump said, is a city in a state with a “a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite tough?”

Mr. Landry, a Republican, welcomed the idea of troops coming to New Orleans. Last year, he helped create a special unit of the Louisiana State Police to focus on public safety in New Orleans. Recent data has shown that New Orleans has recorded a drop in violent crimes this year.

Other Cities

The Trump administration has also suggested sending the National Guard or a surge of immigration agents to other cities, including Baltimore and Boston.

Mr. Trump has said he had an “obligation to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore,” adding that the city is a “very unsafe place.”

The Trump administration has also threatened to send immigration agents to Boston. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the city over its sanctuary policies. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in a statement that Boston was “among the worst sanctuary offenders in America.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/05NAT-CITIES-EXPLAINER-top2-qlch/05NAT-CITIES-EXPLAINER-top2-qlch-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:23.937740

Their work has been instrumental in building genocide cases and pressing for investigations into Israel’s conduct in Gaza and the West Bank.

The sanctions, quietly posted on the Treasury’s website, accuse the organizations of undermining U.S. foreign policy interests, essentially for doing the very work international law demands: documenting atrocities and seeking justice.

These measures come at a time when global pressure is mounting to hold Israel accountable for its military campaign in Gaza, which has left tens of thousands dead, displaced entire communities, and decimated civilian infrastructure.

Rights advocates say the timing is no coincidence. As calls grow louder for war crimes investigations and genocide proceedings, Washington appears to be doubling down on shielding its ally from scrutiny—even if that means punishing those who speak for the victims.

Al-Haq, PCHR, and Al Mezan issued a joint statement condemning the sanctions as politically motivated and legally baseless. “This is not just an attack on our organizations,” they wrote, “it’s an attack on the principle of justice itself.”

The three organizations declared in their joint response, “Only states with complete disregard to international law and our shared humanity can take such heinous measures against human rights orgs working to end a genocide”—a statement that underscores the gravity of the U.S. decision and its implications for global justice.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from international legal experts, who warn that targeting rights defenders for cooperating with the ICC sets a dangerous precedent.

It sends a chilling message to civil society groups worldwide: that documenting war crimes and advocating for accountability may come at a cost.

Enes Hocaogullari, who took part in a March meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, as one of Turkey’s youth delegates, was arrested last month after he criticized the detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and other opposition figures.

The 23-year-old activist also spoke out against alleged police violence during protests that erupted following Imamoglu’s arrest.

Marc Cools, president of a delegation of the Council of Europe’s local and regional authorities congress, said there was no legal justification for Hocaogullari’s prosecution or detention.

“Silencing Enes is silencing youth — and silencing youth is silencing democracy itself,” Cools said after visiting Hocaogullari in prison Friday and meeting a day earlier with Turkey’s deputy justice minister and other officials in Ankara.

Hocaogullari was taken into custody at Ankara’s Esenboga airport in August and later charged with “publicly disseminating misleading information” and “inciting hatred and enmity among the public.”

The first hearing of his trial is scheduled for Sept. 8.

“We hope that justice will prevail, that all charges will be dropped, that he will be immediately released,” Cools said.

Imamoglu, a popular opposition figure seen as the main rival to Erdogan in the presidential elections, was arrested in March over allegations of corruption, which he strongly denies. He was officially nominated as the presidential candidate for the main opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, following his imprisonment.

Several other CHP mayors and municipal employees have also been arrested as part of investigations into alleged corruption. The CHP denies the accusations.

Critics view the arrests as a politically motivated crackdown on the CHP, which made significant gains in local elections last year. The government denies the accusation, asserting that the judiciary operates independently and that the investigations target serious corruption allegations.

Now, as the next Supreme Court Term looms, the VRA is once again at risk.","My time as an Equal Justice Works Fellow at CAC began and ended with Supreme Court cases with major consequences for our multiracial democracy. A few months before I started, voting rights litigators obtained significant victories at the Court that upheld bedrock protections for the right to vote. But threats to voting rights lingered, and two years later, on the last week of my fellowship, CAC filed an amicus brief in the latest challenge to the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and its ability to ensure equal opportunity for voters of color. Much can change in a few years, and I feel exceptionally fortunate that I’ve spent these years at CAC.

Two Supreme Court decisions from June 2023 affected the course of my Fellowship. First, in Moore v. Harper, the Court soundly rejected the so-called independent state legislature theory (ISLT). At the same time, however, the Court created a small potential opening for ISLT proponents, writing that, under the Elections Clause, the Court has the power to review state court decisions on state election law when those courts “transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review.” During the first half of my fellowship, I delved into historical and legal research to combat any future invocations of ISLT and demonstrate that federal court review of state court decisions in this area is only appropriate in extremely rare and unlikely circumstances. This project culminated in an article published in the Boston College Law Review in April 2025 that I co-authored with my colleagues David Gans and Brianne Gorod. As legal scholarship plays a critical role in developing and promoting pro-democracy arguments, I am thrilled that CAC was able to contribute to the important academic discourse on ISLT and support future litigation against the doctrine.

The second case was Allen v. Milligan. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the longstanding legal framework governing Section 2 of the VRA’s protection against vote dilution, which is critical to ensuring that voters of color have an equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. After the Court’s decision in Milligan, several lower court vote dilution cases resumed, and new challenges to the VRA were raised in courts of appeals. I worked on two amicus briefs in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits defending the constitutionality of Section 2 of the VRA and another amicus brief in the Fifth Circuit arguing that Section 2 protects coalitions of voters of color who jointly bring vote dilution claims.

These were not the only voting rights cases that I had the privilege to work on. CAC filed three amicus briefs in litigation challenging state election laws under the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits laws that disenfranchise voters for minor errors in voting paperwork. And in Florida state courts, I worked on briefs defending against efforts to weaken the Florida Constitution’s voting rights protections.

During the last year of my fellowship, however, new threats to democracy emerged, including several actions taken by the Trump Administration to weaken bedrock constitutional rights and principles. And as case after case has been filed to challenge the Trump administration’s lawlessness, CAC has been there defending democracy and the rule of law, and I am grateful to have contributed to the fight as a Fellow. For example, after President Trump purported to curtail birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants, CAC filed several amicus briefs in the Supreme Court and federal courts of appeal on behalf of an ideologically diverse group of scholars of constitutional law and immigration in which we explain that the Fourteenth Amendment means what it says: all children born in the United States are citizens of the United States, and no executive order can change that. I have also worked on amicus briefs CAC has filed in cases challenging the administration’s efforts to unilaterally dismantle executive departments and agencies, including an amicus brief filed on behalf of members of Congress in litigation challenging the administration’s attempt to dismantle the CFPB.

Now, as the next Supreme Court Term looms, the VRA is once again at risk. In Louisiana v. Callais, the Court is considering a challenge to a congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature passed to remedy a Section 2 violation. I worked on the amicus brief CAC filed in the case in December 2024 and wrote a piece in Slate in March 2025 recapping the oral argument. This summer, however, the Court scheduled the case to be reargued this upcoming Term and ordered supplemental briefing on the constitutionality of the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-Black district. During the last week of my fellowship, I worked on another amicus brief that CAC filed in the case, arguing that the drawing of majority-minority districts to remedy vote dilution is consistent with the text and history of the Fifteenth Amendment.

My fellowship started with significant wins for democracy and is ending with a case that could radically undermine the VRA’s ability to protect voters of color and advance the goals of the Fifteenth Amendment. But while the threats to voting rights and democracy may have changed over the past two years, CAC’s steadfast commitment to promoting the progressive promise of the Constitution has not. At the Supreme Court and lower courts, CAC and our brilliant team of attorneys have been there to explain to courts that the Constitution’s sweeping protections for democracy and voting rights cannot be undermined, whether by states seeking to weaken the voting strength of voters of color or a President taking unlawful unilateral executive action. I feel immensely privileged to have been a member of the CAC team over these two years, and I am very grateful for all the opportunities I have had and the lessons I have learned. As I finish my fellowship amidst unprecedented threats to the rule of law and democracy, I am heartened by the fact that CAC will be here to take on these challenges in the months and years to come.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-09-05 14:57:33.270425

This move attempts to criminalize immigrants seeking green cards, naturalized citizenship or those seeking approval under humanitarian programs. Historically, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services operated separately from immigration arrests and enforcing deportations because the agency primarily functions as a naturalization agency.

“Within months, the Trump administration has eroded every avenue for legalized immigration, making the process virtually impossible. Cruelty is the only motivating factor in these current policy decisions,” said Tieffa Harper, deputy legal director, SPLC. “This administration simply does not want immigrants to feel safe and is using any means to make it more difficult to become an American citizen.

“With the hiring of armed agents, the fear of deportations and arrests increasingly becomes an everyday reality for immigrants seeking naturalization services. Under Trump, America is no longer a haven for those seeking hope, prosperity and refuge. The SPLC stands in solidarity with immigrants and our partners fighting on their behalf to demand that the US fulfill the promise of liberty, equality and justice a reality guaranteed by our Constitution.”

Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a September statement that the appellate ruling will permit ""atrocities to happen"" at the Alligator Alcatraz site.
""The Everglades Detention Camp isn’t just an environmental threat; it is also a huge human rights crisis,"" she wrote in a prepeared statement.","An appellate court temporarily allows the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center to remain open.

Gov. Ron DeSantis praised the appellate court's decision, stating the facility is ""open for business.""

Environmental groups challenging the facility have vowed to continue their legal fight.

Gov. Ron DeSantis hailed a Sept. 4 appeals court ruling allowing — for the moment — operations to continue at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center.

""The mission continues on immigration enforcement,"" the governor said in a videotaped statement on social media. ""Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business.""

The order from the11th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, simply allows the state to continue detaining people at the facility until the judicial panel issues a final ruling on the matter.

On Aug. 21, a federal judge agreed with the plaintiffs alleging the state failed to conduct proper environmental assessments and impact studies before opening the facility, and effectively ordered the closing of the detention center.

DeSantis and state officials immediately appealed that ruling.

Plaintiffs: Fight against detention camp and for the Everglades goes on

The groups that challenged the existence of the facility on environmental grounds vowed to continue their legal battle, however, after the latest decision.

In a prepared statement, Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said the ruling imposing a ""limited stay"" on the closure decision is ""disappointing,"" but added that the case is far from being decided.

“We’re hopeful the preliminary injunction will be affirmed when it’s reviewed on its merits during the appeal,” Samples said.

“In the meantime, if the DeSantis and Trump administrations choose to ramp operations back up at the detention center, they will just be throwing good money after bad because this ill-considered facility — which is causing harm to the Everglades — will ultimately be shut down.”

Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, also a plaintiff in the case, said the ruling was ""heartbreaking"" but not a conclusion.

“This is a heartbreaking blow to America’s Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn’t even close to over,” Bennett said in a prepared statement. “The Eleventh Circuit’s order only puts a pause on the district court’s injunction, and we’re confident we will ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility.”

Talbert Cypress, chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, said he was not surprised by the ruling but lauded the dissenting opinion he said steadfastly backed the plaintiffs' position.

“We are disappointed in the majority’s decision to stay the injunction,"" Talbert wrote in a statement. ""We were prepared for this result and will continue to litigate the matter. We find some solace in the dissent’s accurate analysis of the law and will continue to fight for our Mother Everglades.”

Immigration advocates also decry use of Alligator Alcatraz center

The legal battle in federal court is focused on the impact of the facility on sensitive wetlands and wilderness, and potentially on the hydrology that supplies millions of people across South Florida with drinking water.

But the detention camp is also at the center of a bitter debate over the handling of the apprehension, detention and deporting of people in Florida.

The Trump and DeSantis administrations have made the pursuit and removal of people seeking permanent status in the state, as well as those living under temporary protection, a centerpiece public policy issue.

The president has often touted the top priority is public safety by removing foreigners who have committed crimes from U.S. communities, including ""the worst of the worst always first"" as he said when he toured Alligator Alcatraz on July 1. But federal officials have also flatly stated that anyone in the United States without permission is a ""criminal,"" as Madison Sheahan, the Immigration Customs Enforcement deputy director, said in Miramar on May 1.

That position has placed countless of people living and working in the United States at risk of detention and deportation, even though they have otherwise abided by laws, including those who were paroled into the country at the southern border and regularly checked in with authorities while their asylum or status claim was adjudicated through the immigration court system.

Lawyers and advocates for immigrants have decried that feature of the immigration crackdown, as well as the conditions in which people being held in the detention center are suffering.

Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a September statement that the appellate ruling will permit ""atrocities to happen"" at the Alligator Alcatraz site. Bozzetto said the ""thousands of men in tents"" at the location are being held in unsuitable conditions and are being deprived of their human and legal rights.

""The Everglades Detention Camp isn’t just an environmental threat; it is also a huge human rights crisis,"" she wrote in a prepeared statement.

""This is a place where hundreds of our neighbors were illegally held, were made invisible within government systems, and were subjected to inhumane heat and unbearable treatment. The fact that a facility embedded in so much pain is allowed to reopen is absolutely disheartening!""","https://www.palmbeachpost.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/16/NPPP/85692805007-img-7842.jpg?crop=1619,911,x0,y84&width=1619&height=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-05 15:58:04.648977

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), enacted in 2000, marked the United States’ first sweeping federal commitment to confront human trafficking. By offering a clear legal definition of both sex and labor trafficking, the TVPA pioneered a comprehensive national strategy encompassing three key priorities: protection for survivors, prosecution of traffickers, and prevention of future exploitation. The law transformed not only criminal sanctions, but also the landscape of support and hope for survivors.

In the late 1990s, human trafficking was increasingly recognized as not only an international atrocity but a domestic one as well. Awareness campaigns, survivor advocacy, and bipartisan congressional leadership converged to push the issue into the public eye. Heather Pagan from South Carolina, who endured 18 years of sex trafficking after meeting an abuser at 14, would later testify to lawmakers: “This label that had been stuck to me my whole life: ‘You’re just an addict… You’re just a prostitute. You’re a criminal.’ Now had just been stripped off me.”. Stories like hers underscored the urgency of a law that could provide survivors with a clear path to justice and support.

The TVPA laid down a legal framework that defined trafficking and introduced the “3 P’s” approach: protection, prosecution, and prevention. Within its original language were transformative tools: T visas, which permit survivors to remain in the U.S. while cooperating with investigations; federal funding for shelters, counseling, legal aid, and job training; enhanced penalties for traffickers; and support for anti-trafficking initiatives abroad. Shyima Hall of California, who was sold into domestic servitude at eight and smuggled to the U.S. at age ten, benefitted directly from these protections. Her rescue, prompted by a neighbor’s report, led to the first federal trafficking prosecution in Orange County. She vividly recalls: “No one, not a single person, ever deserves to have their life, their freedom, stolen.” Hall later became a U.S. citizen, authored Hidden Girl, and now advocates widely for survivors.

Since 2000, the TVPA has been reauthorized multiple times, in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2013, 2018, and most recently in 2022, each time extending protections and expanding coverage to domestic victims, especially minors, with greater emphasis on labor trafficking. Pamela Lynn Hock of Virginia, trafficked from age 13 to nearly 18, reflects the importance of these expansions. “We were children… we believed everything that they told us. When they said, ‘We are going to murder you if you don’t do what we tell you to do,’ we believed them.” Today, Hock serves on the state’s Commission on Human Trafficking Prevention and Survivor Support, ensuring that survivor-led insight shapes trauma-informed policy.

Federal implementation through the Office on Trafficking in Persons provides grants that fund NGOs, shelters, legal clinics, and prevention education programs in schools. Local task forces unite law enforcement, social services, and healthcare workers to identify and assist survivors. Community awareness campaigns help shift public perception and provide survivors with a clear path to report exploitation and access help. Pagan’s work as Survivor Support Director for Lighthouse for Life demonstrates how these systemic supports can enable survivors not only to heal but to lead, guiding others to reclaim their lives and dignity.

Despite progress, advocates highlight persistent gaps. Funding and resources have often favored sex trafficking over labor trafficking. As Jenny Footle, a survivor and activist, notes, “It is incredibly important to have equal representation of both labor and sex trafficking in all levels of programming, including the lived experience you are engaging with. For too long, survivors of labor trafficking have been forced to the margins in the sector, despite the fact that labor trafficking is the most prevalent form of trafficking here in the United States.” Undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ survivors still face barriers in accessing services. Some survivors, particularly those forced into commercial sex, continue to face criminalization rather than support. While survivor leadership is growing, it remains underrepresented in the design and governance of anti-trafficking policy.

The future must center survivors in every way: as leaders in policy, educators in prevention, and decision-makers in service systems. As survivor leader Emily Warfield emphasizes, “Survivors deserve to decide what happens after they escape a trafficking situation, whether or not that’s prosecution. They deserve a seat at the table, and they deserve to feel safe in anti-trafficking spaces.” Advocates press for more balanced funding between labor and sex trafficking and for anti-trafficking efforts to intersect meaningfully with immigration reform, labor rights, racial justice, and mental health. Communities must stay engaged through prevention education, survivor-led programming, and inclusive legislation, building on TVPA’s legacy with integrity and equity.

Since its enactment, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act has transformed how the U.S. defines and responds to trafficking, from legal frameworks to community interventions. Its tools have opened pathways to safety, healing, and justice for survivors. Yet the fight continues. Individuals and communities can contribute by supporting survivor-led organizations, advocating for inclusive policies, educating others, and promoting systems that empower rather than punish survivors. The TVPA didn’t end trafficking, but it made sure survivors could finally be seen, heard, and fought for. The question now is whether we’ll keep fighting.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/35289026265_9acee79bc3_o-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:56:48.965784

“The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought,” Sean Hecker, one of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, said at the time of his arrest.","The Trump administration warned in immigration court on Thursday that if Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s recent attempt to open an asylum case in the United States is successful, government officials will seek to deport him back to El Salvador, according to a copy of the court filing obtained by The New York Times.

The filing indicates the administration is opening another front in its efforts to expel Mr. Abrego Garcia from the United States for a second time — this time back to his homeland, where a court already ruled that he cannot be sent because he could face threats or persecution there.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly maintained that they will not allow Mr. Abrego Garcia to go free in the United States. And last month, after he was released from custody in the separate criminal case he is facing and then quickly rearrested, they originally said they were considering expelling him to Uganda.

But in a filing in immigration court in Baltimore linked to his asylum request, Trump administration officials seriously raised the idea that sending him back to El Salvador was also an option. They said that opening an asylum case would essentially nullify the earlier ruling that he could not be sent back to his home country.

“Should the Immigration Court grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, D.H.S. will pursue the respondent’s removal to El Salvador,” the Trump administration argued in its filing. It said the earlier ruling “will no longer be valid” if the asylum case moves forward.

The asylum request, which was filed in late August, was the latest twist in the legal cases surrounding Mr. Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who was deported in March to a notorious terrorism prison in El Salvador because of an administrative error. That removal, officials eventually acknowledged, violated a court ruling issued in 2019 that had expressly barred his being sent to the country where he feared his life could be in danger.

But since then, he has become a symbol of the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration tactics. U.S. officials insist he will never go free in the United States, while his attorneys accuse the administration of trying to make an example of him, regardless of the rule of law.

In its filing to the immigration court in Baltimore, Trump officials said that they would seek to overturn the decision barring Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador, claiming it was no longer valid.

When Mr. Abrego Garcia obtained that order, he had also applied for asylum. But while the immigration judge who considered his initial application found the asylum request to be “credible,” he pointed out that Mr. Abrego Garcia had not filed within a year of arriving in the United States as required under the law.

Since his arrest by immigration officials on Aug. 25, Mr. Abrego Garcia has been held in a detention center in Virginia. He is fighting the government’s efforts to expel him from the country again on two tracks — through his asylum request and through a separate civil case that would prevent officials from sending him to Uganda, a country to which he has no ties.

“The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought,” Sean Hecker, one of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, said at the time of his arrest.

After his arrest, Homeland Security Department officials maintained that he would be removed from the United States.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement.

The judge hearing the Uganda deportation case, Paula Xinis, has barred the administration from sending Mr. Abrego Garcia anywhere outside the United States for at least the next few months. Judge Xinis intends to hold a hearing on the possible expulsion to Uganda on Oct. 6 and issue a decision no more than 30 days later.

Even as he fights re-deportation, Mr. Abrego Garcia and his lawyers have been fending off the criminal charges that were brought against him in June in the Federal District Court in Nashville. Those charges, filed in coordination with his return from El Salvador, accuse him of having taken part in a conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States from 2016 until this year.

His attorneys deny those charges and say the government brought them only in a vindictive effort to punish him for having mounted a legal challenge against his initial deportation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/05dc-immig-qpct/05dc-immig-qpct-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:56:39.444142

Kennedy and HHS to link Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism - report

Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr plans to announce that use of Kenvue’s popular over-the-counter pain medication - Tylenol – in pregnant women is potentially linked to autism, without including evidence for the claims, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

Kennedy, in a report, will also suggest a medicine derived from folate called folinic acid can be used to treat symptoms of autism in some people, the WSJ reported.

Tylenol, whose active ingredient is acetaminophen, is a widely used pain reliever, including by pregnant women.

The report, expected this month from the US Department of Health and Human Services, is likely to highlight low levels of folate, an important vitamin, and Tylenol taken during pregnancy, as well as other potential causes of autism, the report said.

Both HHS and Kenvue did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

It is not the first time Kenvue or J&J have faced questions about the link between Tylenol and the condition. In 2023, a judge rejected claims the drug causes autism if mothers take it during pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says Tylenol is safe to use in pregnancy, though it recommends pregnant women consult with their doctors before using it, as with all medicines.

Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group formerly headed by Kennedy, has posted several times in recent weeks on social media site X about the potential link between Tylenol and autism.

Georgia to send National Guard troops to Washington

Georgia is about to become the eighth state to send National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to support Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement big foot operation there, as the US capital sues the administration over its actions.

Georgia governor Brian Kemp announced today that he’s sending 316 members of the state’s National Guard to Washington later this month, in the latest indication that Trump’s law enforcement action there will drag on, the Associated Press reports.

The Republican Kemp said he will mobilize the roughly 300 troops in mid-September to take part in Trump’s D.C. operation to relieve soldiers from elsewhere who deployed earlier.

Georgia is proud to stand with the Trump administration in its mission to ensure the security and beauty of our nation’s capital,” Kemp said in a statement.

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his unilateral action to impose federal resources on DC with the stated goal of cracking down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, seven other Republican-led states have sent troops — Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.

The nationwide debate over gerrymandered redistricting has come to Kansas, as the Topeka Capital-Journal wrote on Thursday.

Republicans initiated efforts, on Donald Trump’s urging, to engineer mid-decade redistricting in Texas, to gerrymander district maps and gain an edge in next year’s midterm elections.

In Kansas, Democratic congresswomen Sharice Davids, who sits in the house with three Republicans to represent the state’s four seats in the lower chamber, could be in difficulty if the district map is gerrymandered by the GOP.

Davids spoke out on Friday, saying: “Under pressure from Donald Trump, Kansas state politicians are pushing an unprecedented mid-decade redraw to make the already gerrymandered maps even more extreme – breaking their promises and putting their own political power ahead of Kansans.”

She added: “Their goal is clear: stack the deck in their favor because they know their policies aren’t popular, including their disastrous budget that rips 79,000 Kansans off their health care just to give billionaires massive tax breaks. Voters, not politicians, should choose their representatives. This potential gerrymander is clearly political, threatens our democracy, and deepens division in our country.”

Donald Trump plans to announce executive orders today in the Oval Office, with the theme we know most about so far being an instruction to rename the Department of Defense the “Department of War”.

Trump was initially expected to issue first orders at 2pm ET then more at 4pm ET, but the media has since been informed that a single event at the White House is now due to take place at 4pm ET.

Some context from my colleague Hugo Lowell: The US president is expected to sign an executive order authorizing the rebrand of the Defense Department, the White House said, as part of an attempt to formalize a name change without an act of Congress.

The order will designate “Department of War” as a “secondary title”, an administration official said, as a way to get around the need for congressional approval to formally rename a federal agency.

But the order will instruct the rest of the executive branch to use the “Department of War” name in internal and external communications, and allows the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to use “secretary of war” as his official title.

Summary

Hello, US politics live blog readers, it’s another busy Friday and there is much more to come, so stay with the Guardian for all the relevant news as it happens. Here’s where things stand:

Most of the 475 people arrested in a massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid at a Hyundai factory construction site in southern Georgia are Korean nationals.

The federal Ice raid is being described as the biggest single Department of Homeland Security (DHS, the parent agency of Ice) enforcement operation at one side in the department’s history. The DHS was created after 9/11.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent called for renewed scrutiny of the Federal Reserve, including its power to set interest rates, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to exert control over the US central bank.

Vladimir Putin has said any western troops placed in Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” for Russian strikes, upping the stakes for Kyiv as Donald Trump’s efforts to forge a peace deal show little sign that are any closer to success.

Donald Trump is sending 10 F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean region. The action to send jets to be based in the US territory follows a deadly US missile strike on Tuesday on a boat that the administration insisted was carrying 11 Venezuelan drug traffickers.

US jobs report. Our sister live blog run by the business team in London has closed now, so here’s our story on the big economics news of the day, that the US added just 22,000 jobs in August, continuing the slowdown amid Trump tariffs.

Reuters notes that the arrests could exacerbate tensions between Washington and Seoul, a key ally and investor in the US, as the countries remain at odds over the details of a trade deal that includes $350bn of investments.

Just last month, South Korea pledged $150bn in US investments – including $26bn from Hyundai Motor – at a summit for the nations’ leaders.

Most of 475 people arrested at Hyundai facility are Korean nationals

The arrested workers were being held at Ice’s Folkston detention facility in Georgia, Schrank said. Most of the 475 people are Korean nationals, he said.

Local Korean media said roughly 300 people detained were South Korean nationals.

“It is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Co. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate,” a Hyundai spokesperson said in a statement provided to Reuters.

Homeland security officials said the workers it arrested at the Hyundai facility in Georgia were barred from working in the US after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas.

The investigation took place over several months, Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of investigations for Georgia, said during a press briefing.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said in comments reported by Reuters.

Schrank said there was a network of subcontractors on the site.

A spokesperson at Hyundai’s battery joint venture partner, South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solutions, said in a statement it was cooperating and had paused construction work.

The facility, a joint venture between LGES and Hyundai Motor, was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES.

Treasury secretary Bessent calls for 'entire' review of Fed

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent earlier called for renewed scrutiny of the Federal Reserve, including its power to set interest rates, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to exert control over the US central bank, whose insulation from short-term political pressures is widely seen as key to its effectiveness.

“There must also be an honest, independent, nonpartisan review of the entire institution, including monetary policy, regulation, communications, staffing and research,” Bessent wrote in the Wall Street Journal.

He called for the Fed to leave bank supervision to other governmental authorities and to “scale back the distortions it causes in the economy”, including by bond purchases made outside of true crisis conditions.

Ice executed search warrant at Hyundai facility over employment practices, DHS says

A US homeland security department spokesperson had earlier said that US immigration authorities executed a judicial search warrant at the Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday over unlawful employment practices and other alleged federal crimes.

The spokesperson said in a statement provided to Reuters that Ice’s investigative arm executed the warrant as part of acriminal investigation.

“This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation,” the spokesperson said.

Trump administration will enforce foreign worker laws, White House says after Hyundai raid

Following on from my last post, the White House said today that the Trump administration will enforce laws that require foreign workers have proper authorization to be in the United States, after immigration authorities raided a Hyundai facility in Georgia.

“Any foreign workers brought in for specific projects must enter the United States legally and with proper work authorizations,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, quoted by Reuters.

“President Trump will continue delivering on his promise to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

475 arrested at Georgia Hyundai site in biggest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations history

A multi-agency immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant site in Georgia led to the apprehension of 475 people, a Homeland Security Investigations official said Friday.The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia.

He said some had overstayed their visas.The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported.

Councilmember Bob Kettle, a military veteran and chair of the Public Safety Committee, said the city is working to address crime without help from Washington, D.C.

""We're up to 24 pieces of legislation."" Kettle said. ""The real time crime center, the CCTV, also the automatic license plate readers, they help system. This is making a difference for our city.""

Kettle, who criticized the Trump administration’s militarization of the National Guard in Los Angeles this summer — a move a judge struck down this week — called the federal tactics “junior varsity” compared to Seattle police.

“No face mask, no face coverings. They have to announce who they are … They don’t come in all dressed tactical, dressed with face coverings. That’s not law enforcement,” he said.

Council President Sara Nelson also criticized federal actions, saying they undermine Seattle’s approach to building trust in policing.

“Not on our watch will ICE agents undermine our efforts to ensure everyone in every community across our city feels safe,” she said in a statement this week.

RELATED: ICE arrests dip in July but remain high in Washington

Advocates with the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network (WAISN) say they’ve tracked ICE arrests at hotspots such as 3rd Avenue and Pike Street in downtown Seattle, often involving agents in unmarked cars. They warn the activity is creating fear that keeps immigrants from working in both urban and rural communities.

“It’s terrible because we can’t do anything without them trying to do something,” said Naomi Bailey, a White Center coffee stall manager who said she feared for her freedom after witnessing an ICE arrest in a drive-through in July. “I mean, I almost got arrested just yelling at them.”

Kettle argued federal agencies should instead focus on cutting off the flow of drugs and weapons into the city along the I-5 corridor.

On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.”

Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand.

“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said.

And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others.

Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.

“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”

Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next.

“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.

“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.”

Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property.

“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.”

But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”",https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Adobe-Town-2-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:27.738301

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 294 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 29 through Sept. 4.

Among the new cases, four people were charged in El Paso for their roles in a scheme to smuggle children from Mexico into the United States, sometimes using candy laced with THC to sedate them during smuggling events. Mexican nationals Susana Guadian and Daniel Guadian; U.S. citizen Dianne Guadian; and Manuel Valenzuela, a lawful permanent resident residing in El Paso, were charged with conspiracy to transport aliens and bringing aliens to the United States for financial gain. According to the complaint, between on or about May 1 through Oct. 17, 2024, the defendants were part of an alien smuggling organization (ASO) that brought unaccompanied alien children between the ages of five and 13 illegally into the United States from Juarez, Mexico. The complaint alleges that Susana Guadian and Daniel Guadian recruited drivers to transport the children by car from Mexico to a port of entry at the U.S. border. The drivers and their co-conspirator would then present U.S. documents to inspecting officers falsely claiming the documents belonged to the children, and that they were the parents of the children. During at least one smuggling event, the alien children were given gummy candies containing marijuana to sedate them. One of the children was taken to a local hospital and later diagnosed with marijuana poisoning. Once inside the United States, the children were then transported to El Paso, where, according to the complaint, Dianne Guadian and Manuel Valenzuela would pick up the children and provide payment to the drivers. The drivers were paid $900 for each minor that they brought into the United States.

U.S. Border Patrol agents in Alpine arrested a Mexican national for being an illegal alien present in the United States. Ever Ortega-Uranga was previously removed for the second time in July 2021. Ortega-Uranga has multiple felony convictions, having been sentenced in Midland to two years confinement for cocaine possession in 2010, followed by three years for public order crimes in 2016. He was also sentenced in 2018 to 46 months confinement in Spring for illegal re-entry.

Otoniel Lopez-Tellez, a Mexican national, was taken into ICE custody in Williamson County, where he was serving a 40-day jail sentence for assault causing bodily injury to a family member. Lopez-Tellez has been removed from the U.S. twice, the last being in 2018, in addition to four voluntary returns.

Mexican national Juan Eduardo Villanueva-Mancilla was taken into ICE custody in Bastrop County, where he was serving a 180-day jail sentence for evading arrest with a vehicle. Villanueva-Mancilla has been removed from the U.S. twice, most recently in April 2023.

Angel Eduardo Moreno-De La Rosa was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents near Normandy on Aug. 27. The Mexican national was allegedly guiding two Pakistani illegal aliens to a pick-up location, where the two Pakistanis would then be transported to San Antonio. According to a criminal complaint, Moreno-De La Rosa claimed he would be paid $1,000 for his role, while the Pakistanis alleged that they paid around $30,000 each to be smuggled further into the U.S.

Mexican national Emanuel Ruiz-Alcantara was arrested near Maverick on Aug. 29 and charged with illegal re-entry after being previously removed to Mexico on Jan. 7. In August 2023, Ruiz-Alcantara was convicted for a smuggling of persons felony in Gonzalez, for which he was sentenced to two years in jail.

Cristian Jiovanni Chavez-Sanchez, also a Mexican national, was charged with illegal re-entry after he was arrested near Maverick on Aug. 26. Chavez-Sanchez has been twice deported, most recently in January through San Ysidro, California. In 2024, he was convicted of four misdemeanors in Utah, including a DUI, marijuana possession, and two weapon offenses.

Honduran national Brayan Alexander Villanueva was arrested near Val Verde on Aug. 30 and charged with illegal re-entry. Villanueva was just removed to Honduras through El Paso on June 28, after being convicted and sentenced in March to two years confinement for possession of a controlled substance. Villanueva was also convicted in 2022 for burglary of a vehicle in Georgetown.

Also in the Del Rio Sector, four Indian nationals—Vikash Vikash, Mehakpreet Singh, Aditya Sharma, and Harsh Singh—were each detained in separate incidents and charged with improper entry after they allegedly crossed the Rio Grande River into the U.S. near Eagle Pass between Aug. 28 and Aug. 30.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States.","Federal and immigration agents arrested 475 people while executing a judicial search warrant at a Hyundai facility in Georgia as part of a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.

Everyone arrested, most of them South Korean nationals, were ""illegally present in the United States or in violation of their presence in the United States, working unlawfully,"" Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, said at a news conference Friday morning.

It was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, Schrank said, adding it “underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans.""

A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building a battery plant next to their manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.

Videos on social media showed agents lining up hundreds of workers at the construction site. Schrank said they questioned everyone about their immigration status, reviewing their documents and conducting background checks.

""This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses. This has been a multimonth criminal investigation,"" Schranck said.

No criminal charges in connection to the investigation had been filed as of Friday.

On Friday afternoon, a judge in the Southern District Court of Georgia unsealed the 15-page search warrant allowing federal agents to go into “the lithium battery cell manufacturing plant” on the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America campus “that is currently under construction.”

The warrant authorized federal agents to seize employment records and immigration documents as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site.

According to the warrant, authorities were also looking for four individuals, but the reasons why the federal government was specifically interested in them remains under seal.

U.S. Attorney Margaret E. Heap said in a statement that more than 400 agents participated in the massive enforcement action, which is part of the broader nationwide initiative “Operation Take Back America,” described as an effort “to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations.”

The South Korean government responded to the detentions of many of their nationals in a statement Friday.

“In the course of U.S. law enforcement, the economic activities of our investment firms and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed upon,"" said Lee Jae-woong, a spokesperson for South Korea's foreign ministry. ""We conveyed our concern and regret to the U.S. Embassy today and urged them to take special care to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our nationals are not violated.”

Jae-woong added that an on-site task force will be established in Georgia with the help of the South Korean consulate in Atlanta.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News that President Donald Trump remains committed ""to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

“The United States is proud to be a home for major investments and looks forward to continuing to build on these historic investments and partnerships that President Trump has secured,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""Any foreign workers brought in for specific projects must enter the United States legally and with proper work authorizations.""

A Hyundai spokesperson told NBC News in a statement Friday that the company is ""closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.""

""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate,” the statement reads.

An LG Energy Solution spokesperson also said in a statement that they “are closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.""

""Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,” the statement reads.

According to Schrank, the workers arrested at the construction site were employed by a network of various contractors and subcontractors, which investigators are looking into.

They all remain in ICE custody after most were brought to the Folkston immigration processing center in Georgia following their arrests, Shrank said.

South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States. In July, Seoul pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment in an effort to lower Trump’s threatened tariffs on its products, which he ended up setting at 15%.

In March, Hyundai said it would invest $21 billion in U.S. onshoring from 2025 to 2028, a number it said last month had increased to $26 billion.

It said the initiatives involved in the investment — including a new $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana, expanded U.S. auto production capacity and a state-of-the-art robotics facility — were expected to create about 25,000 direct jobs in the U.S. over the next four years.

Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Georgia, where the raided construction site stands, is one of the largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites in the state.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have said that the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,400 people, is the largest economic development project in the state’s history.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250905-Hyundai-atf-raid-2-se-1056-7a0c39.jpg",N,,2025-09-05 16:57:13.120164

UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.” “For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk.
Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.
“The Trump administration’s decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns.
“This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”","The U.S. State Department is facing heavy criticism after it announced on Thursday it is imposing sanctions on three major Palestinian human rights groups over their participation in the International Criminal Court’s case (ICC) against top Israeli officials.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he’s adding Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) to the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,” as part of President Donald Trump’s executive order sanctioning the ICC.

The three groups are leading human rights organizations in the occupied Palestinian territories, operating out of the West Bank and Gaza. They have been instrumental in monitoring Israel’s genocide in Gaza and annexation of the West Bank, serving as a key voice of Palestinians amid Israel’s assaults. Sanctions could have a vast chilling effect on their work.

“These entities have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent,” Rubio said. “We oppose the ICC’s politicized agenda, overreach, and disregard for the sovereignty of the United States and that of our allies.”

The groups decried the sanctions in a joint statement calling on states to pressure the U.S. to lift the sanctions. They noted that this is part of a longtime effort by Israel to silence Palestinian voices, by law or by force.

“Threatened by the impact and role of our advocacy, legal research, and documentation in exposing Israel’s ongoing international crimes, the United States has resorted to punishing individuals and organisations seeking to uphold the legal system upon which the international community was founded,” the groups said.

“The implications go beyond Palestine: by protecting Israel from accountability, they are dismantling the international legal order and undermining the possibility of justice for victims of grave crimes anywhere,” the groups went on. “But we will not give up nor be silenced. We will not bend to any State apparatus or system fuelled by violence and oppression.”

The sanctions come after the U.S. sanctioned another Palestinian human rights group, Addameer, which focuses on Palestinian prisoners’ rights, and UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese.

Rubio’s announcement was widely condemned. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.”

“For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk. “The work of civil society in documenting violations and engaging with international accountability mechanisms is all the more important when international humanitarian and human rights laws are being violated systematically in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.”

A coalition of Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, including major organizations like B’Tselem, called the sanctions “violent.”

“This is yet another move aimed at erasing fundamental norms of protecting human beings, designed to enable Israel to continue harming Palestinians without restraint,” the coalition said.

Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration’s decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns. “This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025_09-05-marco-rubio.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:57:01.379000

Following the coup, the National Provisioning Ruling Council struggled to control Sierra Leone against invasion from the Revolutionary United Front, and news of coup plots spread across the capital of Freetown. On Dec. 29, 1992, the National Provisioning Ruling Council extrajudicially killed approximately 29 victims, including former government officials and others accused of planning a coup against the regime. Victims who were not already detained in prison were arrested; several were tortured, and all were summarily executed and their bodies buried in a mass grave.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has initiated a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, acting on his campaign promise to enact the largest mass deportation of such persons in U.S. history.

Immigrants in the country with both legal and illegal residency have been caught up in the crackdown, raising concerns about the scope and impact of the initiative.

Such impacts include several negative effects on the economy, such as the overall monetary and labor cost of the deportation, with documented and undocumented immigrants making up around 20 percent of the U.S. workforce at the start of the year. That number has dropped to 19 percent by June, representing a decline of more than 750,000 workers, according to the Pew Research Center.

What To Know

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Atlanta office participated in the raid, which included Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Georgia State Patrol (GSP), and other partner agencies.

Troopers blocked the roads leading to the Hyundai site, and operations at the plant continued without interruption, according to CBS News.

In an emailed statement to Newsweek, a Hyundai spokesperson said, ""We are aware of the recent incident at the HL-GA Battery Company construction site in Bryan County, Georgia.""

""We are closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.""

The company has made significant investments in the U.S. in recent years, including in Georgia, where it is building facilities related to electric vehicle and battery production.

Hyundai Motor Group started producing EVs a year ago at its $7.6 billion plant, which employs roughly 1,200 workers.

What People Are Saying

A Department of Homeland Security official told Newsweek: ""ICE Homeland Security Investigations, in coordination with our law enforcement partners, executed a judicial search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.

""This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation,"" the spokesperson said. ""This investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for those who violate the law and upholding the rule of law.

""Complex cases like this require strong collaboration and extensive investigative efforts, and we extend our gratitude to the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, FBI, DEA, Customs and Border Protection, ATF, IRS, and the Georgia State Patrol for their invaluable support,"" the spokesperson added.

ATF Atlanta wrote on X: ""Today, [ATF Atlanta] joined HSI, FBI, DEA, ICE, GSP and other agencies in a major immigration enforcement operation at the Hyundai mega site battery plant in Bryan County, GA, leading to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.""

""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades.","Protesters Friday morning will gather outside an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview, calling for its closure after the village said it would be used as a processing center for a ""large-scale"" immigration enforcement campaign led by the Trump administration.

The protest, from groups citing the Illinois Way Forward Act, are expected to gather as early as 7 a.m. Days earlier, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village's roughly 8,000 residents that federal officials said the two-story building, at 1930 Beach St., will be used for the operation for approximately 45 days.

The letter also warned residents that protests and demonstrations near the building, ""like those seen earlier this year in Los Angeles, where property damage and assaults against law enforcement were reported,"" could occur.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,"" village administrator LeTisa Jones told the Associated Press. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

As of 7:15 a.m., several protesters had begun to gather in front of the center, with more arriving as the morning went on, some with signs, and a small police presence.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

Local

Immigration attorneys have previously told NBC Chicago that during the last round of scaled up ICE enforcement, it was difficult to make contact with their clients at the facility.

ICE stationed in Lake County

According to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, increased ICE enforcement in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs could begin as early as this weekend.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago.""

At least 300 federal agents expected to come to the Great Lakes Naval Base in North Chicago as part of the Trump Administration's enhanced operations from ICE, Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said.

A joint statement from the Lake County Government and the City of North Chicago Wednesday called the planned federal operations at the Naval Station ""unprecedented.""

""If the agents are stationed here in Lake County and they say they're going to be in Chicago, who's to say they won't come in to our community?,"" Rockingham Jr. said, who added that the community is approximately 40 percent Latino.

During his Tuesday press conference, Pritzker also said he was ""deeply concerned"" that ICE will target Mexican Independence Day.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

In Chicago, organizers with El Grito, a popular Mexican Independence Day event slated for Sept. 13 and 14 in Grant Park, moved to cancel the festival due to the concerns.

""This was a painful decision; however, with the heightened political tensions and given our location in downtown Chicago, we need to keep our community safe,"" organizer German Gonzalez said in a statement Thursday. ""To proceed in spite of the advice we've received directly from city and state officials and potentially expose our community to becoming collateral damage would be irresponsible. That's a risk we are not willing to take.""

A similar festival in Waukegan was also postponed until November over fears of the increased ICE presence.

Pritzker said agents could be fully assembled by Friday, with operations beginning Saturday, though his office hasn't received official communication from the White House.

Last week, a report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

Mayor Rockingham said the agents will not be staying at the base, and will be housed at hotels in Lake County.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/Image-from-iOS-11.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:44.433524

At the same time, a major federal immigration operation involving officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is also expected to begin in the city.

Last Sunday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, claimed the Trump administration had not informed him of the deployment plans, and that such a move would amount to an “invasion” of the state.

On Saturday last week, Chicago’s Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing Chicago police not to collaborate with National Guard troops or federal agents. The order also urged federal agents to wear body cameras and reveal their faces rather than wear masks, as they have done during previous, “military-style” immigration raids under Trump.

Trump deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles in June, and in Washington, DC, in August, purportedly to fight surging crime rates, but residents and state officials have complained that such moves are undemocratic and say that over-policing will erase trust between local police and communities.

What is the National Guard?

The National Guard is a state-based reserve force totalling 430,040 soldiers and airmen who are serving part-time, rather than full-time. It includes the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard units. National Guard members often hold a civilian job in addition to their military duties.

Each US state and entity has its own National Guard unit, and all together make up the US National Guard. The Guard can be activated for federal missions, such as under Trump’s recent directives, meaning it is dually-controlled by states and the federal government.

The National Guard’s origins go back to colonial-era militias that formed during British rule, with the first colony-wide militia forming in Massachusetts in 1636. Those militias later evolved into an organised, national structure following US independence.

What happened in Los Angeles?

In June, Trump deployed nearly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 US Marines to Los Angeles to quell public protests against ICE raids. California Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as “political theatre”.

A court ruled on Tuesday that the deployment was illegal. It was the first time since 1965 that a president had federalised National Guard troops to address unrest in a state without a governor’s permission. President Lyndon B Johnson, at the time, sent troops to Selma, Alabama, to protect civil rights protesters from violence.

What happened in Washington, DC?

On August 12, Trump announced at a White House press conference that he was temporarily taking control of Washington, DC’s Metropolitan Police Department under Section 740 of the rarely invoked District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows federal control of police during an emergency.

Government officials said the DC force would be in place till November, according to a report on Thursday from ABC News.

Trump additionally deployed 800 National Guard troops to the city to “rescue” it from what he said was a crime and homelessness surge.

“I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said in his announcement. “This is Liberation Day in DC, and we’re going to take our capital back.”

Trump has also said that his administration will seek the death penalty for murder cases in the city.

Washington, DC, is classified as a unique federal district and is a Democratic stronghold. As US president, Trump has direct control over the District of Columbia National Guard and can use the DC police force for 48 hours, or up to 30 days if he notifies Congress. However, Congress has not been formally notified of the recent moves.

DC Mayor Muriel Bowser initially criticised the deployment, describing it as “unsettling and unprecedented” on August 11. She added that although violent crime had spiked in the city in 2023, recent data shows crime rates have been falling and that violent crime is at a 30-year low.

Bowser has since tried to cooperate with federal agents by setting up an operations centre to coordinate communications between federal agencies and local law enforcement. The centre was established under Bowser’s “Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center” (SBEOC), which is a play on Trump’s lingo.

One of the centre’s tasks is to ensure federal agents maintain policing practices that instil confidence in residents, such as not wearing masks, identifying their agencies and providing identification when interacting with people.

Despite that, on August 27, Bowser told reporters that there was a “break in trust” between communities and the police due to the presence of federal agents who wore masks and were not always identifiable. Bowser said she was “devastated” because some residents in the city said they were living in fear.

Why does Trump say it is necessary to deploy troops to cities?

Trump has argued that it is essential to combat crime in Los Angeles, DC and other cities. Despite widespread criticism and legal challenges, he has defended his decision, saying some troublemakers have to be handled by soldiers.

“Frankly, they were born to be criminals,” Trump said on Wednesday, when he confirmed the Chicago deployment would happen but did not give dates. “And they’re tough and mean, and they’ll cut your throat, and they won’t even think about it the next day. They won’t even remember that they did it. And we’re not going to have those people.”

The president has also pointed to what he says are the positive results from the DC federal takeover. Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Trump said the city was now safe and that restaurants were enjoying booming businesses.

“We have no crime,” Trump said. “You’re not going to be shot.”

Republican lawmakers have backed Trump’s actions, especially in DC, where some are proposing a “Make Our Streets Safe Again Act” to target crime and address homelessness.

“President Trump’s unyielding leadership and strength, coupled with proper congressional oversight, ensures that Washington, DC, will reclaim its rightful place,” US Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican, said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Where else has Trump threatened to deploy the National Guard?

Trump and officials from his administration have floated possible plans to deploy the National Guard in Democratic-led cities including Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and New York.

On Tuesday, Trump stated at a conference that he has “an obligation to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore”.

On August 22, he told reporters in the Oval Office that “Chicago is a mess”, and that his administration “will help with New York”.

The day before, ICE’s acting director said agents would “flood” Boston to remove immigrants in the so-called “sanctuary city”, referring to municipalities that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement on immigration issues.

Officials in Baltimore and Chicago, meanwhile, insist that crime rates have fallen in their cities.

In July, Baltimore’s police department said there had been a significant drop in gun violence compared to last year. The city’s Mayor Brandon Scott also told reporters on Monday that by September 1, 2025, 91 homicides and 218 non-fatal shootings were recorded. He said it was the lowest yearly homicide rate in over 50 years.

Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a conference that overall crime rates had fallen in the city by 21 percent. “We will not have our police officers, who are working hard every single day to drive down crime, deputise to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” he said.

How bad is crime in Chicago?

With a population of 2.7 million, Chicago has long had a national reputation linked with high crime rates, particularly gun violence. Legal experts say that reputation has some basis, but that crime rates are not unconnected to the era of racial segregation.

In reality, however, crime rates in Chicago vary depending on the crime type, and generally mirror those in other major cities, according to analysis by CBS News, which cited data from the Chicago Police and the FBI.

Last year, the city had 18,327 reported cases of violent crime, which translates to 695 per 100,000 people. In comparison, Oakland had 1,925 cases per 100,000; Detroit, 1,781; Little Rock, 1,672; and Baltimore, 1,606. Houston, which has a smaller population of 2.3 million, recorded a total of 26,628 violent crimes or 1,148 crimes per 100,000.

According to data from the DC-based Council on Criminal Justice (CJC), Chicago did see a 369 percent [nearly fivefold] increase in violent crime, property and drug offences between 2019 and 2023, driven mainly by a surge in vehicle thefts that was recorded in several other large cities in the same period. Many US cities similarly recorded high crime rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More recently, the CCJ reported that overall crime in Chicago by June 2025 was down compared to 2024.

In a year-on-year analysis, the CCJ noted that violent crimes such as homicides had reduced by 33 percent compared to last year. Aggravated assaults fell by 16 percent, gun assaults by 27 percent, robberies by 35 percent, carjacking by 51 percent and domestic violence by 10 percent.

An exception to the downward trend was sexual assault cases, which only reduced by one percent between June 2024 and June 2025.

What do critics of Trump’s hardline approach say?

Trump’s deployment of troops in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and the looming Chicago deployment have faced criticism and legal challenges from law experts, officials and residents. Some say it constitutes the formation of a “police state”, the sidelining of state authorities, and overreach. Others say it is over-policing that could have an adverse impact on relations between communities and local law enforcement.

“This is an active military takeover of the capital,” protesters who assembled outside Congress in DC on Thursday wrote in an open letter to lawmakers, which they handed out.

“It is a textbook indicator of backsliding democracy and intensifying authoritarianism … This might come off as alarmist, but in the last 100 years of history, the pattern is clear and we are witnessing it in real time,” the letter stated.

California Governor Gavin Newsom and the state’s Attorney General Rob Bonta have also argued that Trump’s decision to deploy federal military agents violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement.

This week, US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the Los Angeles deployment was unprecedented, an overstep of presidential authority, and ultimately, illegal. The case had been filed in June by the state of California.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” Breyer wrote, referring to Trump’s insistence that the anti-immigration-raid protests constituted a “rebellion” that needed to be quashed.

“Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law,” Breyer wrote in his judgement.

“Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act willfully,” Breyer wrote of the Trump administration, adding that the troops deployed failed to adhere to their training materials by carrying out 12 functions that the military is barred from, such as making arrests, carrying out searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, and riot control.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/afp_68b36cb776b3-1756589239.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:26.734962

""They are insulting the service and the honor and integrity with which my husband has served this country and broken his body in that service,"" said Melissa Chaudhry, wife of Zahid Chaudhry.

She says DHS' latest press release reads ""like a political hit job"" and is a ""smear campaign"" against her husband who was at an appointment to get U.S. citizenship when he was detained by ICE.

She says as her husband's 9th circuit appeals moves through the court system, his children cry for him as he remains locked up at the Northwest Ice Processing Center in Tacoma.

""[Zahid] is sick. He is deprived of medication for his thyroid, for the burning in his chest that keeps him up day and night,"" said Melissa. ""He's kept in conditions that qualify as animal abuse if they were inflicted on pets.""

The Council on American-Islamic Relations - Washington (CAIR - WA) released this statement to FOX 13 Seattle:

""We’ve seen a pattern of DHS under this administration engaging in smear tactics to high profile detainees, in order to shore up public opinion to back up their aggressive decisions. There is no need for the Department of Homeland Security to target Mr. Chaudhry’s personal life, especially while he is detained and separated from his family. Every person deserves dignity.""

Micaela Romero, a Digital Organizer and Communication Associate with the Washington Community Action Network (WACAN) sent this statement in response to DHS' press release:

""I am appalled and disgusted by this baseless ""rebuttal"" to our community’s unrest, heartache, and attacks on our family members and loved ones. We’ve known Zahid as a member of WashingtonCAN for over 10 years, and in that time, and since his detainment, we have encountered hundreds of individuals with stories of how Zahid has impacted their lives and been a public servant to their communities. As we continue to show up in our other issue areas, people recognize us as being the organization fighting to bring their loved one and community member, Muhammad ""Zahid"" Chaudhry, home.

""It is on the duty of this administration to do a far better job than they’ve done to prove that Zahid Chaudhry is a worst fraudster and criminal than the Commander in Chief that sits at the helm of these cruel decisions tearing apart families. The community is tired of these deceptive attack on immigrants to silence the tangible gaps left when ICE abducts fathers from their children.""

Melissa is urging supporters to reach out to elected leaders about her husband Zahid.

The apportionment data the Administration tried to illegally hide, and was ultimately forced to divulge, reinforces that the Trump Administration acted with the intention of illegally delaying and restricting funds lawfully provided by Congress.","The recent release of 1,800 internal budget documents shows just how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to illegally withhold or restrict funding. The documents detail how the Trump Administration has abused its authority by adding new layers of political interference and control over agency spending to impose its policy priorities and preferences, even when doing so conflicts with the law.

Until a court intervened, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had been illegally hiding agency “apportionments” — a crucial aspect of financial management whereby OMB grants agencies access to the funds appropriated in statute — actively and intentionally frustrating Congress’s ability to provide oversight over the Administration’s compliance with spending laws. Yet an apportionment is meant to be a routine plan for agencies’ use of funding intended to ensure that the federal government does not violate the restrictions on spending established in law.

Though delaying the spending of lawfully provided funds for policy reasons is illegal, the Trump Administration has seemingly sought to do so through three tactics. First, it is delaying apportionment approvals well past when they are required by law, or withholding them altogether. Second, it is establishing further conditions for an agency’s actual receipt of funds that are hidden from public view. Third, it is designating significant funding amounts as “unallocated” — apparently making it unavailable for agency use for the purposes Congress outlined in law, pending some later agreement between OMB and the agency. In each instance, it is creating an opportunity for abuse that the public disclosure of apportionments was meant to prevent.

Congress gave OMB the power to apportion funds for good reasons: to ensure that spending laws are faithfully followed and that agencies do not overspend the resources available to them and prematurely run out of funding. Congress voted on a bipartisan basis to require these apportionments be made public after President Trump used the apportionment process to illegally withhold military assistance intended for Ukraine during his first term.

With the documents’ recent release, we do not yet know the depth to which the Trump Administration abused the apportionment process, or the full scope of the effects on programs — and people. But what we have seen is more troubling evidence of its efforts to illegally “impound” — not spend — the funds Congress provided.

To take just one example, the Administration leveraged its apportionment power in its effort to illegally withhold billions of dollars in National Institutes of Health (NIH) support for medical breakthroughs and treatments in cancer, diabetes, and other critical health research fields (see “Apportionment as a Tool of Impoundment: NIH as a Case Study” below).

Similarly, it abused its apportionment power to illegally freeze Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support for public health programs until late into the fiscal year, when the funds would be at risk of going unused. With these types of abuses, the Trump Administration has ignored Congress and the law to undermine critical programs that people count on.

Delaying Apportionment Approvals

The Trump Administration is waiting longer than in past administrations to apportion funds for certain programs to delay obligations. Although apportionment plans must be approved within 30 days of enactment of appropriations, OMB consistently provided approvals much later in 2025. For instance, in 2024 OMB approved over 100 apportionments for Department of Health and Human Service accounts in the 30 days following the enactment of full-year appropriations, compared with fewer than ten over the same period in 2025.

The Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund, designed to generate economic growth and opportunity in some of the nation's most distressed communities, has faced an enormous delay in gaining access to the funds provided by Congress in March. The Trump Administration only apportioned funds for the administration of the CDFI program on July 30 — more than four months after full-year appropriations had been enacted — and still has not apportioned the funds for making awards. By comparison, in 2024, those funds were apportioned roughly two weeks after the funds were appropriated.

Notably, the July 2025 apportionment of CDFI’s administrative funds came the day after 26 senators sent a bipartisan letter to OMB expressing concern over delays in making awards. That the Trump Administration has proposed severe cuts to the CDFI Fund for 2026 raises the clear possibility that its actions to illegally restrict congressionally provided support in 2025 through the apportionment process are an effort to unilaterally advance its desired policies despite the funding enacted into law.

Requiring Agency Spending Plans

OMB also conditioned many apportionments on its approval of a separate “agreed-upon spending plan” with the agency, above and beyond approval of the apportionment itself. These requirements can be found in over 100 apportionments approved by the Trump Administration between March and August of 2025, which affect at least six cabinet departments, as well as the Social Security Administration and other smaller agencies. Similar requirements — conditioning the availability of funds on OMB approval of an agency spending plan — have been used only rarely in prior administrations.

Further, in over half of those more than one hundred instances, OMB explicitly required the agency to provide a “detailed description” of how the spending plan “aligns with Administration priorities,” illegally delaying funds from being used for the purposes established in law in order to effectuate the Administration’s own spending priorities. In some cases, OMB laid out in the apportionment the minimal purposes for which it would allow an agency to spend funds in the absence of an approved spending plan — making clear that approval of the spending plan had not yet been given at the time an apportionment was approved.

With no transparency about what was required for a spending plan to meet OMB approval, the process is ripe for abuse and misuse. The Administration’s approach provides no way for the public to know if the information being required of agencies is merely an excuse to delay making funding available, or if agencies are required to give other unrelated policy assurances to OMB to gain access to their statutorily provided funds. It is at least possible that approval of some spending plans was conditioned on agencies providing assurances that they would not fully spend some portion of the lawfully provided funding. Arguably, given that the apportioned funds cannot be made available until these “agreed-upon” spending plans were approved, the plans themselves constitute “documents apportioning an appropriation,” which OMB is required to make publicly available under the law.

In the case of funding for the CDC’s public health programs targeting health promotion and chronic disease and injury prevention, no apportionment was received until July 29. But even worse, the apportionment stated that CDC could only “continue to make obligations for salaries and related administrative expenses” until OMB approved its spending plan, suggesting that had not yet occurred. This was confirmed in reporting on August 1 that CDC awards continued to be frozen, with an OMB spokesperson saying that “the CDC money is undergoing a programmatic review because the office is still waiting on CDC’s spending plan.” Thus, CDC still could not make awards with two months remaining in the fiscal year, leaving it unclear whether CDC can responsibly award all its lawfully provided funding before the September 30 deadline at the end of the fiscal year.

Using “Unallocated” Accounts

Finally, in at least a handful of instances, the Trump Administration apportioned significant funds as “unallocated” — apparently making them unavailable for use to execute the purposes Congress outlined in law, pending some later agreement — in accounts where that is uncommon, if not unprecedented. For example, at the Department of Education, over $600 million in Innovation and Improvement funds and roughly $500 million in Institute of Education Sciences funds were, and remain, apportioned as “unallocated.” The Trump Administration has proposed significant budget cuts for both in 2026. Further, apportionment footnotes reveal OMB plans to “automatically” re-apportion these unallocated funds once OMB agrees to their planned use — meaning that whether these impounded funds are ever released, or the purpose to which they are to be put if released, may remain hidden until after the fiscal year ends.

The apportionment data the Administration tried to illegally hide, and was ultimately forced to divulge, reinforces that the Trump Administration acted with the intention of illegally delaying and restricting funds lawfully provided by Congress. But it will take some time for auditors, Congress, public interest groups, and reporters to comb through all the recently released documents to fully understand the extent to which the Trump Administration has been abusing the apportionment process to advance its policy goals and aid in its illegal impoundments.

Defense Department to get a new name

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Friday changing the name of the Department of Defense to the ""Department of War,"" reviving a title that was abandoned during a 1947 Cabinet reorganization. The move, confirmed by a White House official, is intended to reflect what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has described as the administration's effort to instill the ""warrior ethos"" across the armed forces. The move to go back to the Department of War comes, ironically, as Trump has tried to cast himself as a peacemaker.

HHS hearing hostility

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced a tense Senate committee hearing Thursday as lawmakers pummeled the Health secretary's changes to the department amid major overhauls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

What's happening at HHS? There has been a mass exodus at the agency, including the loss of its director, but others left in protest of Kennedy's leadership and his controversial views on vaccines.

The departures have sparked turmoil. Now, some of the Trump administration's Republican allies in Congress are finding the chaos hard to ignore.

Calls for RFK Jr. to leave mounted: More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services officials on Thursday called for Kennedy to step down from his position.

Is Trump's immigration crackdown worsening school absenteeism?

""It's heartbreaking because at the root of it is fear of coming to school. There's a lot of fear from children, even if the children were born here in the United States, because one member of their family was not. They wonder, 'What’s going to happen to my uncle, mom, aunt or dad as a result?'""

~ Carlos Castillo, superintendent of Fresno Unified School District, which has a large, predominantly Hispanic immigrant population. USA TODAY examined how the Trump administration's increase in immigration enforcement has contributed to an increase in student absenteeism across the region as parents keep their kids home from school out of fear of being deportation or family separation.

ChatGPT-induced 'AI psychosis' is a real thing

In a conversation with ChatGPT, USA TODAY Wellness reporter Alyssa Goldberg told her AI therapist “Harry” that she was crashing out after seeing an ex for the first time in almost a year:

""No matter what I said, ChatGPT was gentle, caring and affirmative. No, I hadn’t done anything wrong. But in a separate conversation with a new 'Harry,' I flipped the roles. Rather than being the depressed ex-girlfriend, I roleplayed as an ex-boyfriend in a similar situation.""

Goldberg's finding? Unlike a real therapist, it refused to critique or investigate her behavior — regardless of which perspective she shared or what she said. It's evidence of how easy we can slip into “AI psychosis” — which isn’t a medical term, but is an evolving descriptor for AI’s impact on individuals vulnerable to paranoid or delusional thinking, such as those who have or are starting to develop a mental health condition.

Now, a handful of residents are coming together to push for change in local immigration policy.

The Proposal

Verónica Martínez is one of the latest to join Cleveland Heights for Immigrant Rights – a grassroots movement that wants city council to pass a nine-page resolution. The proposal includes a $200,000 pilot program for providing free legal counsel over the next two years. It is one of several of their demands.

“The other points are also very important,” Martínez said. ""One of them asks for the respect of the human rights that are in the Constitution.”

Her family is from Mexico and has been living in Cleveland Heights for nearly two years. Martínez said, for her, this project is personal.

“This country could not have been built without those brave people who were our predecessors and who were also here building and collaborating for this country,” Martínez said. “... It is very significant for us now to raise our voices for all those who cannot do so today.”

Karly Whitaker also joined the movement following the Cilantro ICE arrests. She’s taken on canvassing local businesses for support.

“We got over 70 businesses in our community that signed that pledge and then expressed some interest in ‘Know Your Rights’ training,” she said.

Following ICE arrests

Cilantro Taqueria said three of their workers who were detained in February self-deported while others are still in the process of obtaining citizenship.

Martínez said she has close connection to several of the restaurant workers, including one young, single mother. In her address to Cleveland Heights city officials, Martínez said the mother was released by ICE officers after discovering she had an 11-month-old baby.

“The people who were caring for her baby, frightened by what had happened, no longer wanted to care for him, so she was practically forced to flee. Today we do not know her whereabouts,” she said.

Looking Forward

The movement has received support from several councilmembers, Whitaker said, but, they’re hoping to create solidarity across the entire community.

“Our motto is, I believe, “all are welcome,” Whitaker said. “And like, it should be a community that embraces that diversity and make sure that all feel welcome and safe.”

Still, Martínez said, presenting the proposal is only the beginning of their fight.

“Our plans for the future it is to continue gathering, to continue uniting and to continue working,,” Martínez said. “We’re going to continue preparing people so they know their rights.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/cilantro-folo-main-photo,N,,2025-09-05 11:58:30.095364

“There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.” Immigrants' Medicaid under attack National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press. While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care.

The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.

“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”

The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. illegally off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.

At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.

“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”

Trump administration targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.

Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.

Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.

“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.

California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.

As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs and dental care.

Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.

“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud and abuse very seriously.”

It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.

California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.

Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.

And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”

“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”

Immigrants' Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.

“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

Wu has said the city continues to work with federal law enforcement on criminal cases and the DOJ lawsuit echoes that.
The Trust Act was first passed by the Boston City Council in 2014 and amended in 2019.
""While the City of Boston enjoys federal cooperation with the Boston Police Department— including with ICE-HSI—in criminal enforcement, the Boston Trust Act expressly shuts out substantially all cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement,"" the suit says.
The DOJ argues that ICE is carrying out its mission to enforce the country's immigration laws following directions and using methods provided by Congress.","Mayor Michelle Wu said Boston ""will not yield"" as the U.S. Department of Justice sues the city over its policy to restrict police cooperation with non-criminal federal immigration enforcement.

The DOJ announced Thursday that it had filed a civil suit against Boston, Wu and Police Commissioner Michael Cox seeking to have a federal judge invalidate ""Boston's sanctuary city laws that interfere with the federal government's enforcement of its immigration laws.""

At issue is the so-called Trust Act, which bars city police from honoring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to keep a person in police custody for longer than required while the federal agency considers the person's immigration status. Wu has said the city continues to work with federal law enforcement on criminal cases and the DOJ lawsuit echoes that.

""The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America – they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,"" U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. ""If Boston won't protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.""

Wu, who has repeatedly defended the city as it has attracted the ire of the Trump administration, said the latest ""unconstitutional attack on our city is not a surprise.""

""Boston is a thriving community, the economic and cultural hub of New England, and the safest major city in the country — but this administration is intent on attacking our community to advance their own authoritarian agenda,"" she said in a statement. The mayor added, ""This is our City, and we will vigorously defend our laws and the constitutional rights of cities, which have been repeatedly upheld in courts across the country. We will not yield.""

Massachusetts has not declared itself a ""sanctuary state,"" but the state and its capital city have been popular targets of the Trump administration amid pushback against policies that federal officials see as lenient towards immigrants.

Boston's Trust Act explicitly tells local law enforcement they ""shall not detain an individual solely on the basis of a civil immigration detainer request or an ICE administrative warrant after the individual is eligible for release from custody, unless ICE has a criminal warrant, issued by a Judicial Officer, for the individual.""

The Trust Act was first passed by the Boston City Council in 2014 and amended in 2019.

In its 2017 Lunn decision, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts state law ""provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody.""

The DOJ's lawsuit says Boston police ""honored all civil immigration detainer requests from ICE"" throughout 2015, but has since stopped doing so ""as the national crisis with illegal immigration reached its peak.""

The suit claims that Boston ""singles out the Federal Government for disfavored treatment"" with its policy but also notes that the city does still work with the feds on criminal and homeland security matters.

""While the City of Boston enjoys federal cooperation with the Boston Police Department— including with ICE-HSI—in criminal enforcement, the Boston Trust Act expressly shuts out substantially all cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement,"" the suit says.

The DOJ argues that ICE is carrying out its mission to enforce the country's immigration laws following directions and using methods provided by Congress. And by resisting what Congress has authorized, the suit says the Boston policy ""requires federal immigration officers either (1) to engage in difficult and dangerous efforts to re-arrest aliens who were previously in local custody, endangering immigration officers, the particular alien, and others who may be nearby, or (2) to determine that it is not appropriate to transfer an alien to local custody in the first place, in order to comply with their mission to enforce the immigration laws.""

U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Boston called the DOJ lawsuit a scare tactic and said she does not want the city to be intimidated by the Trump administration ""as they continue terrorizing our communities.""

""Nothing the Trump Administration has done since taking office has been about public safety. From the militarization of our cities, to abducting our neighbors off the street, to sham, baseless lawsuits like this one—it has always been about sowing fear, punishing dissent, and tearing apart hardworking immigrant families,"" Pressley said.

The many changes to immigration enforcement policies introduced by the Trump administration since the president’s inauguration in January has led what some Catholic dioceses are calling “terror” to take hold of Spanish-speaking parishioners throughout the United States.

CNA asked dioceses around the country what effects, if any, the administration’s changing policies have had on Spanish Mass attendance. While responses varied — some dioceses have noted declines while others have seen increased attendance — one theme appeared throughout: Immigrants are filled with fear.

‘It’s more than fear — it’s terror’

The Archdiocese of Atlanta has not collected data on Mass attendance, and any changes in attendance, if any, are “very small,” according to Yolanda Muñoz, the director of Hispanic and Latino ministries for the archdiocese.

She told CNA that although people are “very afraid,” their “faith is strong and they find ways around” their fears. Some carpool with people who have legal status. Many have created WhatsApp chats “to inform one another if there are areas of danger to avoid.”

Muñoz said some priests are even going to places where “there is a heavy concentration of immigrants, like trailer parks” to say Mass.

The archdiocese has held informational meetings in parishes at which immigrants are educated in their rights as well as in ways to plan and protect themselves and their families if they are deported.

Although the current “situation is very difficult and very sad, we must keep on reminding ourselves that Christ is in the boat in the middle of the storm,” Muñoz said.

Archbishop Gustavo García-Siller of the Archdiocese of San Antonio told CNA he had not heard from priests that people were avoiding going to church, although on the day he spoke with CNA, he said he had just heard from a local priest about three families that were taken into custody.

He stressed that “fear is there. It’s more than fear — it’s terror.”

Nevertheless, he said that at least in San Antonio, people “trust the Church and their communities” because they have faith.

García-Siller said he thinks San Antonio is unique because there is more acceptance of immigrants there due to integration that has been ongoing for decades in the city.

“In San Antonio, we have Spanish Masses in almost all parishes … Hispanics here go to any parish,” he said.

According to the archbishop, the federal government has, until February of this year, asked the Church in San Antonio to help immigrants, and the Church responded, through Catholic Charities, with humanitarian aid, medical and legal assistance, counseling, and spiritual support.

“What is beautiful to see in San Antonio is that these services are not done only by professionals but also people from the parishes, laity, religious men and women, brothers, religious nuns and diocesan priests,” he said.

“I have seen in the last few months more people in need. People are eating less, they are avoiding getting health care, and some even avoid going to school,” he said.

(Story continues below)

“We don’t ask them if they have papers or not,” he continued. “Because of the rhetoric in the country, people are very damaged, very scared. We avoid divisive narratives.”

The prelate said that immigrants “know that we as the Church, the body of Christ, we are for them.”

‘Less likely to linger after Mass’

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Las Vegas told CNA the archdiocese had noted a decline in participation at some Hispanic parishes, “particularly in Mass attendance and religious education enrollment.”

“One parish that would typically see around 1,500 children in its first Communion program has closer to 860 this year,” according to the archdiocese. ”In addition, families seem less likely to linger after Mass for community activities and socializing.”

Parishioners expressing ‘apprehension and fear’

Secretary for Communications and Public Affairs for the Archdiocese of Boston Terrence Donilon told CNA that the climate of “uncertainty” has resulted in “a stressful time for ethnic communities in the Commonwealth” of Massachusetts, with parishes rescheduling or seeking “alternatives” for summer festivals used for parish fellowship and fundraising.

“Anecdotally some pastors, though not all, have noticed Mass attendance among non-Anglo parishioners decline during this period of concern,” Donilon said.

Alayna Fox of the Diocese of Burlington, Vermont, told CNA that “while the Diocese of Burlington does not have a large population of native Spanish speakers, it has been reported that attendance at the Masses offered in Spanish have experienced a drop in attendance.”

The communications director for the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, Tara Bishop, noted that there had been a decline in attendance recently, though she said the diocese could not “definitively attribute” it to immigration policies.

She went on to say that many parishioners had “expressed apprehension and fear about participating in various parish events.”

However, Bishop said that “it is common to see a significant drop in attendance at Eucharistic celebrations during the summer months, so this decline may be part of a seasonal trend rather than a direct result of immigration policy changes.”

Need for a ‘spiritual dimension in this time of stress’

Echoing Bishop, Father Will Banowsky of Holy Spirit Catholic Church located in the southwest part of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City said that seasonal effects on attendance rather than fear of immigration enforcement seemed to explain declines in Spanish Mass participation throughout the summer.

“A lot of people went back to their countries in the summer, or they went on vacation,” he said.

Many returned for the start of the school year, he said. There were 920 people at a recent Spanish Mass at Holy Spirit, whose congregation is about 50% Hispanic and where the average is closer to 650-800.

Banowsky told CNA that the higher-than-average attendance numbers in August could be attributed to people knowing they need that “spiritual dimension in this time of stress.”

While he said his parish and others in the archdiocese have not been “hurting” regarding attendance, he said there is still a lot of fear among Hispanic parishioners, and “social media doesn’t help.”

“We try to make sure people can find a refuge from their fears here, whatever those fears may be,” he said.",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Immigrants_Credit_Diego_G_Diaz_Shutterstock_CNA.jpg?jpg,N,,2025-09-05 13:57:38.084635

(AP) — U.S. immigration authorities on Thursday raided the sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in southeast Georgia, conducting a search that shut down construction on an adjacent factory being built to produce EV batteries.

The operation targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by the governor and other officials as the largest economic development project in the state’s history. Hyundai Motor Group began manufacturing EVs a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities were conducting an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre (1,214-hectare) site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant “as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.” It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested.

Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.

Video posted to social media Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: “We’re Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.”

“We need construction to cease immediately,” the man says. “We need all work to end on the site right now.”

President Donald Trump's administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

In addition to making electric vehicles at the site facing Interstate 16 in Bryan County, Hyundai has also partnered with LG Energy Solution to build the battery plant. It's slated to open sometime next year.

The joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, “is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities,” the company said in a statement. “To assist their work, we have paused construction.”

Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.

The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.
But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.
“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director.
“I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals.","Federal land managers have had a rough time implementing contentious plans to eliminate roughly 3,600 free-roaming horses from 2.1 million acres of southwest Wyoming, where private and public land are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern.

Although U.S. District Judge Kelly Rankin of Wyoming concluded last year that the Bureau of Land Management’s whole-herd removal plan is legal, his decision was appealed and roundups were postponed, and then in July the plan was declared at odds with the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The federal appellate judges out of Denver sent the case back to the Wyoming court to remedy legal deficiencies. The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.

But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.

“[T]he BLM Rock Springs Field Office still plans to proceed with the permanent removal of wild horses in the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town Herd Areas, with operations expected to begin on or about Oct. 13, 2025,” Jacqueline Alderman, a spokesperson for the agency’s ?High Desert District, wrote in an email.

It remains unclear how the agency will address the three-judge panel’s concerns. “The BLM cannot comment on ongoing litigation,” Alderman wrote.

Pro-horse plaintiffs aim to stop the mid-October roundups from happening.

On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.”

Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand.

“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said.

And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others.

Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.

“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”

Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next.

“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.

“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.”

Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property.

“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.”

But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/adobe-town-2-scaled1757024666.jpeg?h=7207289a&itok=DqPUhB-9,N,,2025-09-05 10:56:52.091202

Officials say as many as 300 federal agents are expected to operate out of Naval Station Great Lakes each day to conduct operations in Chicago.

Naval Station Great Lakes is serving as a logistical hub for the agents.

The president has argued the operations are to increase safety in Chicago though community leaders have doubts about those claims.

Protests expected at Broadview ICE facility

Its expected demonstrators will descend on the location because it's expected to be the main processing hub for those detained by ICE as a part of their upcoming operation.

Village officials said federal authorities informed them that as a part of a large scale enforcement operation, the facility would serve as a primary processing location. It will operate seven days a week for the next month-and-a-half.

Broadview's mayor adds that the village is coordinating its efforts with local law enforcement including the illinois state police and the Cook County Sheriff's police to help ensure safety and order.

While touring a school in west suburban Berwyn to listen to concerns from residents about the ICE operations, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stressed that protests must remain peaceful, so as not to give the trump administration any excuse to deploy the National Guard.

""But part of their kinda nefarious plan is: begin with ICE. Cause mayhem on the ground. And by doing that, say that there's a need for military troops on the ground to protect ICE,"" Pritzker said. ""That's why I've talked a lot about for the people that are going to protest they've gotta protest peacefully. Not give them any reason to call in the National Guard or military troops of other types.""

Village officials said they have also been working to help prepare local businesses for any demonstrations. Protests could begin Friday morning.

The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.

The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.

Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia. The operation marks one of the latest examples of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown at workplaces across the country.

All 475 people taken into custody were illegally present in the US, Schrank said. He said some had overstayed their visas.

The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.

The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported. The facility has been touted by Georgia’s governor as the largest economic development site in the state’s history, the AP said.

Hyundai is cooperating with law enforcement and is “committed to abiding by all labor and immigration regulations,” spokesperson Michael Stewart said.

The same day, hundreds of miles away in upstate New York, dozens of workers at a family-owned plant that makes nutrition bars were also apprehended during an ICE raid, officials said, drawing the ire of Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.

GOP governor promoted the Metaplant

At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”

ATF Atlanta said the operation led “to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.”

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has touted the Hyundai Metaplant as a boon for the Georgia economy.

In 2022, Hyundai announced an agreement with the state of Georgia to build Hyundai’s “first dedicated fully electrified vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities in the United States” in Bryan County, the company said.

The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.

“With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.

CNN has asked Kemp’s office for comment about Thursday’s immigration raid at the Metaplant.

Dozens apprehended in New York raid

In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.

The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.

The group estimates that “upwards of 70 employees” were questioned and “nearly all” were then arrested and taken to the nearby Oswego Detention Center. A spokesperson for the group told CNN they’re still waiting to hear from authorities about exactly how many were detained.

Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.

“I am outraged by this morning’s ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.

Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”

ICE confirmed to CNN affiliate WSTM that it carried out a “court-authorized enforcement action” in Cato. Employees told WSTM that around 60 workers were detained. CNN has reached out to the agency for further details.

Mark Schmidt, the owner of Nutrition Bar Confectioners, told the New York Times that all his workers had legal documentation to work in the US. “We’ve done everything we can to vet people we hire,” he said.

Schmidt described the ICE raid as “overkill.” His son Lenny Schmidt, the company’s vice president, told the Times the scene was “almost theatrical,” describing police dogs and all-terrain vehicles involved in the operation.

“It could have been handled so much more humanely and decently,” he said. “This kind of raid, you feel like it’s a drug bust or a human trafficking situation.”

NEW BEDFORD – Federal immigration agents arrested a Guatemalan man on Thursday morning while he was checking on a property he owns in the South End, according to family members.

Jose Bonilla, 58, who lives in Everett, was stopped by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the intersection of Roosevelt Street and Cove Road. He had traveled to check on one of his three properties in New Bedford, a building he owns on Cleveland Street.

Carolina Zavora, a relative who was accompanying Bonilla in the car, said the agents had been waiting at the property and followed them when they left. She saw at least two SUVs, additional vehicles, and five agents. According to Zavora, the agents showed Bonilla a photo of one of his former tenants when they pulled them over.

“He told them it wasn’t him in the photo,” she said in Spanish. “Then they asked for his license.”

Zavora said Bonilla explained to the agents that he came to New Bedford only to check on his property. He also told them he had an open petition for a visa through his wife, Norma Umana, a green card holder. After looking at his license, Zavora said, the agents told him the petition had been rejected.

“How is that possible?” said Kimberly Samanta Portillo Umana, Bonilla’s daughter, who drove from Everett to pick up her father’s car. “When we checked, it was still processing.”

Portillo Umana said that after the arrest, she called their lawyer, who confirmed via the USCIS website that the petition is still processing.

According to Massachusetts court records, Bonilla had a misdemeanor charge for unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in Chelsea District Court, which was dismissed in 2007.

Bonilla’s wife, who is from Guatemala, said she is a volunteer with Latinos Unidos en Massachusetts (LUMA), an immigrant advocacy group. She left for El Salvador on Wednesday and had planned to stay for a few weeks, but is now trying to return early.

“I’m checking flights now to come back and be with my family,” she said. “This is stupid. People are working, but they don’t have freedom anymore.”

As she spoke with The Light, Umana received an incoming call. “My son is calling me,” she said. “I don’t even know how to tell him.”

Lucy Pineda, founder and director of LUMA, said the call she received from Umana on Thursday about Bonilla’s arrest was one of five she got that morning.

“It’s sad because this is another case, and it’s close to us, and we have many cases every day, every hour,” she said.

Since the start of the current administration, Pineda said, LUMA has been keeping track of arrests across the state based on calls they receive from family members.

“We’ve been helping families because they don’t know how the process works,” she said. “So we help them to find where they’ve been detained.”

As of Thursday afternoon, the ICE detainee locator did not list Bonilla’s location. ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

The Light has confirmed that ICE has arrested more than 50 people in the Greater New Bedford area since February.

Bonilla’s arrest in New Bedford comes more than a month after the most recent reported local immigration arrest. On July 26, Jhovani Duvan Leiva Cornejo was arrested in the Port of New Bedford after returning from a fishing trip. On July 23, ICE, alongside the U.S. Coast Guard, detained Luis Guillermo Castro Alvarez. Two days before, ICE detained an undocumented Salvadoran man, Juan Carlos Abarca-Jovel.

In other ICE actions today, agents questioned another man in New Bedford’s North End about his residency status about four hours before they arrested Bonilla.

Dashcam video provided to The Light by the man, who asked not to be identified due to concerns around his asylum process, shows a masked agent wearing military garb exiting a large vehicle with New Jersey plates at 6:10 a.m. The agent approached the man, who is from Guatemala, and asked: “¿Tienes documentos?” [Do you have documents?] Shortly afterward, another masked agent who had parked farther down the street is seen walking toward the scene.

The man told The Light that agents let him go shortly after they noticed that he wore a GPS monitor around his ankle.

“I have no problem with ICE,” he said in Spanish. “I have my papers in order.”

Since Trump returned to power in January, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has been bolstered by record funding and new latitude to conduct raids.

The president has said he wants to deport “the worst of the worst” criminals. But ICE figures show a rise in the detainment of non-criminals.

Lee did not specify exactly how many South Koreans were detained, calling the number “large,” but media reports suggested that 300 or more had been taken into custody.

Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday that the raid resulted from a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site and was the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The Thursday raid targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai Motor Group a year ago began manufacturing electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant west of Savannah that employs about 1,200 people. Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have touted it as the state’s largest-ever largest economic development project.

Agents focused their operation on an adjacent plant that’s still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries batteries that power EVs.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Lee said the ministry is dispatching diplomats from its embassy in Washington and consulate in Atlanta to the site, and planning to form an on-site response team.

Schrank told reporters in Savannah that while some of the detained workers illegally crossed the U.S. border, others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working. He said some of those detained worked for the battery manufacturer, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site.

Schrank said he didn’t know precisely how many of the 475 detained were Korean nationals, but that they made up a majority. No one has yet been charged with any crimes, he said, but the investigation is ongoing.

“This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks, and put them on buses,” Schrank said. “This has been a multi-month criminal investigation where we have developed evidence and conducted interviews, gathered documents and presented that evidence to the court in order to obtain a judicial search warrant.”

He said most of the detainees were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line.

President Donald Trump’s administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

The Hyundai site sits on 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares) in a largely rural area of Bryan County, drawing in workers from several surrounding counties and communities including the city of Savannah, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.

Hyundai began producing electric vehicles at the site last September. A few months later, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chairman Euisun Chung during a White House appearance with Trump credited the president with the company’s decision to create more American jobs by building an EV factory in Georgia.

“Our decision to invest in Savannah, Georgia, creating more than 8,500 American jobs, was initiated during my meeting with President Trump in Seoul in 2019,” Chung said at the March event.

The battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is slated to open next year.

In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was “closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.” It said it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

“Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,” the company said.

Operations at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing plant weren’t interrupted by the raid, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson. Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday it was “working to understand the specific circumstances” of the raid and detentions.

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company’s statement said. “We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.”

HL-GA Battery Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. In a statement Thursday, the company said it’s “cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities.”

About 20,000 of those employees came from outside ICE, the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, found, including some agencies that have sent significant portions of their workforces to the deportation effort. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations, which is responsible for investigating transnational crimes including drug and human trafficking, has sent more than 12,000 employees to the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division. HSI as of the most recent data on ICE’s website had “more than 10,000 employees,” meaning it has both grown and sent nearly its entire workforce to assist with immigration enforcement.

ERO itself has around 6,000 officers on staff.

Many of the other employees detailed to ICE come from the Justice Department, including the Bureau of Prisons, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshal Service and Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The State Department has sent nearly 300 Diplomatic Security staff to ERO to aid in deportation efforts, while the Internal Revenue Service has around more than 1,700 employees assisting ICE. That marks a significant ramp up from June, when Government Executive reported IRS had 250 of its agents detailed to the Homeland Security Department.

Other DHS components are also contributing to ICE’s immigration enforcement crackdown: Customs and Border Protection has detailed more than 5,000 employees toward the effort, while U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has sent more than 4,000. Government Executive previously reported USCIS staff working on refugee operations in the Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate were pushed by their leadership to accept details to ICE to demonstrate their ""adaptability"" and to “justify our continued employment.” About one-quarter of the refugee office was detailed to ICE as of June.

The responsibilities of the detailees have varied. IRS agents have been authorized to make arrests for civil violations of immigration law, while USCIS employees were largely working on administrative matters like verifying an immigrant’s status or correcting information for ICE.

Some employees temporarily assigned to ICE are serving for limited periods, such as 60 days or six months, while others, such as those from CBP, are working for the enforcement agency indefinitely.

DEA has assigned nearly 40% of its total employees to ICE, according to Cato’s data, while the ATF has sent nearly 30% and USMS around 20%.

Some new details that did come up, however, revealed that the state initiated conversations with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the potential of converting the McCook center to ICE use.

Most of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee attended a closed-door meeting Thursday to discuss the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp.

Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style prison into a 300-bed immigration detention facility over the next 45 days.

While several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee have said they were notified of the plan shortly before the public announcement, Democrats on the committee were excluded. A group of 13 progressive lawmakers then submitted a letter requesting a public hearing to cover questions about the proposal. The Governor’s Office and Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln then organized the briefing.

Several state officials reportedly attended to answer questions, including Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys and Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, former prosecutor in Lancaster County and a former chief of the criminal bureau for the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Neither were available to answer questions after. They took a separate exit down the hall from where reporters had gathered.

Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature who did not sign the letter requesting a public hearing, said state officials were not able to provide many answers to her questions, including whether the McCook facility has the capacity to house the ICE detainees or the funds to cover the expected costs of the conversion.

During the meeting, DeBoer said officials did share that Nebraska reached out to Homeland Security about repurposing the McCook center — and not the other way around — following a social media post by President Donald Trump inquiring about states with space to house such a facility.

She did not specify which Nebraska official reached out. But Pillen has made several trips to Washington, D.C., and to the White House.

DeBoer said she was told there is currently no agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services to convert the McCook facility into a detention center, but she expects one to be completed within the next 60 days.

This contradicts or clarifies Pillen’s estimates last month that the repurposed facility would be operational within 45 days. Bosn said her understanding is that the ICE center would open around 45 to 60 days after the agreement is finalized.

DeBoer said she was told that the existing employees at McCook would remain state employees through the transition and that the repurposed center would house “low-level” inmates, or inmates that meet an ICE-specific classification.

The new center will house only adults, according to Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also attended the briefing. He said officials were unable to clarify whether detainees will be only men, or a mix of men and women, but noted that there won’t be any mixing of Nebraska inmates with ICE detainees.

As for what will happen with the state inmates currently housed in McCook, DeBoer said some will go to various community corrections centers, where they may have been transferred naturally. Others will be reabsorbed into other prisons, and DeBoer said there was talk that some of the other eastern Nebraska prisons may need to expand their low-level security housing areas, as the McCook center currently has a large share of those available beds.

Bosn said she was reassured at the briefing when Jeffreys said no existing inmates should lose access to resources or lose progress in their programming as a result of the transition. She said Jeffreys told her he has an employee dedicated to ensuring the transition goes smoothly.

Jeffreys reportedly told meeting attendees that Nebraska’s overall prison bed capacity was at 98%. Rountree said an engineer is currently examining the capacity of the McCook prison.

The Work Ethic Camp currently houses 168 inmates, and DeBoer noted the facility was originally designed for 100. Pillen’s press release claimed the center is currently at 84% of bed capacity. Either way, DeBoer said the repurposed center would likely be crowded.

With Nebraska having one of the most overcrowded prison systems in the country, some have expressed concerns about how a new ICE center might exacerbate the problem by eliminating one of the state’s existing prisons.

Corrections is already dealing with displacing 387 inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln after an August windstorm tore the roof off of two buildings, which are currently under repair. DeBoer said Jeffreys told senators the penitentiary is also dealing with a new water problem that occurred this week.

Bosn said she “disagrees with the narrative” that Nebraska’s prisons are overcrowded. She argued that since the overall system’s capacity is below 100%, that means there’s still room. But DeBoer said the combination of capacity concerns and the quick timeline for the project has her worried about what the conditions will be like in the repurposed center.

“My confidence is a little shaken about whether or not the Department of Homeland Security will live up to the standards that I would want Nebraskans to have,” DeBoer said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

DeBoer visited the McCook facility Wednesday and said she met with people who were considering modifications that may be needed to transform the building into an ICE detention center. She mentioned that they were considering installing a second fence but said officials at the briefing did not share other details about what modifications would be necessary.

She said she asked if the new center would have space for detainees to consult with attorneys and got no answer. The current center has little need for such meetings, DeBoer said, as most of the inmates are there late in their sentences. During her visit, she said she didn’t see any space that could be used for that purpose.

Rountree said state officials also were unsure about how much it would cost to make this transition, although he got the indication that hosting the center might be helpful toward state finances.

Repurposing the Work Ethic Camp won’t just reduce bed space within Nebraska’s prison system, DeBoer said, but it would also eliminate a facility with a specific mission that was set by the Legislature in 1997.

Though it is crowded, DeBoer said WEC appears to have better conditions for its inhabitants relative to other Nebraska prisons, including offering better food and overall more humane treatment.

“I took the time to look out the windows, and they look over a meadow,” DeBoer said.

Of the questions asked in the letter that prompted the briefing, one that was not addressed was whether the executive branch has the authority to initiate this project. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

DeBoer said she purposefully didn’t ask about this because she didn’t think it would be a “productive” conversation. She believes her opinion on the topic differs from that of the governor’s team and said the question is better left for the courts.

In Pillen’s press release, he argues that state statute gives him the authority through the creation of the Department of Correctional Services, as well as an article in the Nebraska Constitution that states that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

DeBoer said there may be enough reason to justify the Legislature filing a lawsuit to challenge Pillen, though she said she had no details on whether such a lawsuit is coming.

The meeting was closed to the press and lawmakers outside the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln tried to attend, but was quickly kicked out.

Conrad said Bosn told her the meeting was meant to be for Judiciary Committee members only. But she countered that in Bosn’s own words from her letter responding to progressives, the committee “has no more extraordinary authority than any individual senator, or group of senators, to seek answers” to their questions.

“Senator Bosn’s public statements, and now private actions, stand in sharp contradiction to each other,” Conrad said.

Bosn countered that committees commonly hold private meetings open only to committee members and said Conrad has the same ability to call a meeting of her own. DeBoer declined to comment on Conrad’s exclusion.

As Congress and the country reconvene after summer break, and as we take stock of what has happened and what is to come, we again ask “at what cost” is the Trump administration willing to go to pursue its mass deportation agenda?

Below, we highlight the costs to children and communities; the costs to our economy, and the costs to our democracy due to the mass deportation crusade on display – as well as the potential political costs citing the growing opposition among most Americans witnessing the mass deportation agenda in action:

Costs of mass deportation on children, families, schools and communities

Recent heartbreaking stories of Dreamers detained, moms and dads deported, and, literally, prioritizing the detention of firefighters over the fighting of a fire remind us of the human toll – and screwed up priorities – of the Trump/Miller mass deportation agenda. But the fears and traumas associated with Back to School season this year perhaps most viscerally captures the costs on real people and communities.

Trauma on kids this back to school season: At an America’s Voice virtual press conference held in late August, educators, child psychologists, and immigration experts discussed how the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda is harming kids and changing educators’ focus this back-to-school season. Watch a recording of the Back to School virtual event here.

During the virtual event, following remarks from leaders from AFT, NEA and a Washington, DC-based child psychologist, Alberto Carvalho, Superintendent, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) said:

“Schools must always be safe havens for learning, free from fear or disruption. Immigration enforcement activities have no place on or around our campuses, as they create an atmosphere of anxiety that harms every student, regardless of background.”

Costs of mass deportation on key American industries and our economy

From worries about crops rotting in fields due to labor shortages to Americans’ paychecks shrinking due to immigration restrictions, the economic cost of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda on key American industries and all of us has been a major storyline this summer.

Economists, farmers, workers’ advocates and new analysis on the costs of mass deportation: At an August virtual event convened by America’s Voice, economists, farmers, and workers’ advocates gathered to assess the costs to key American industries and their workforce of the mass deportation agenda. As we noted, “Trump’s mass deportation assault disrupts our economy and drives up prices on groceries and housing for all Americans. This isn’t just bad immigration policy – it’s economic sabotage that hurts working families and damages entire communities.” Read the post event release here and watch a recording of the virtual event here.

During the event, Chris Gibbs, President, Rural Voice USA, and Rural Voices Network, noted:

“As a farmer, this immigration report only verifies what I already knew and it’s intuitive to my fellow farmers know as well is this ham-handed immigration enforcement action is by this administration just adds one more layer of uncertainty to the environment created by the tariff debacle, no new real trade deals to market my corn and soy beans and continuing rise in input cost of doing business on the farm.”

The event also featured the release of new analysis by Economic Insights and Research Consulting detailing the economic damage already underway on our economy and the ag, construction, and leisure/hospitality industries. Read “Warning Signs of the Economic Harms from Deportations“

Costs to our democracy of the mass deportation agenda

Using the pretext of immigration and crime concerns, the Trump administration is taking aim at core American rights and protections and advancing a brand of authoritarianism that is at odds with core democratic ideals. Meanwhile, Trump/Miller are building his own personal police force. Given the unprecedented funding for ICE, and the administration’s disdain for law and order – will there be any hiring standards beyond fealty to MAGA?

Immigration is the “tip of the spear” in broader dangerous agenda: Denying people the right to bond hearings, targeting political opponents, firing immigration judges and fast tracking the removal of individuals without due process are all interrelated parts of the mass deportation crusade and elements that threaten all Americans’ basic rights and protections. Read the recent AV statement: “Trump’s Escalating Attacks on Democracy”

As Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) noted about the deployment of military against American communities:

“Any rational person who has spent even the most minimal amount of time studying human history has to ask themselves one important question: Once they get the citizens of this nation comfortable with the current atrocities committed under the color of law, what comes next?”

New task force and ICE recruitment – creating Stephen Miller’s private army? Included in a late August executive order was the creation of a new task force, helmed by Stephen Miller, that will “create an online portal for ‘Americans with law enforcement or other relevant backgrounds and experience’ to apply to join federal agents in enforcing Mr. Trump’s ‘crime emergency’ order” per the NYT. Meanwhile, much about the unprecedented ICE hiring spree should raise alarms – from cash bounties for arrests and hiring teenagers to the disturbing motivations of potential applicants. Read more on the topic here and read a related assessment in The Bulwark here.

The public opposition and political costs to mass deportation agenda

The more Americans witness the Trump/Miller mass deportation agenda, the more they reject it. A strong majority of the public, including Latino voters, are consistent in what they want: order at the border, enforcement targeted at actual public safety threats, legal channels for hardworking individuals and a process for Dreamers and long-settled immigrants to become U.S. citizens – not targets for detention or deportation. And a range of recent polling on the administration’s militarization of American communities similarly finds broad opposition.

Concluding thoughts

The high costs of the mass deportation agenda are growing more clear. They also are being used as a pretext and excuse – the “tip of the spear” – for the broader and dangerous assault on our democracy. We’re in a perilous moment, not just for immigrant communities but for all Americans concerned with our basic conceptions of self-governance, our rights and core pillars of democracy.

It is fully within the power of Congress – including some of the Republicans selectively speaking out about the harms and excesses of mass deportation- to push for a new path forward on immigration and to defend our democracy. They are on the wrong side of voters and the wrong side of history.",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RedFence-1200x800.png,N,,2025-09-05 15:57:52.628864

475 arrested at Georgia Hyundai site in biggest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations history

A multi-agency immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant site in Georgia led to the apprehension of 475 people, a Homeland Security Investigations official said Friday.The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia.

He said some had overstayed their visas.The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported.

The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.

The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.

GOP governor promoted the Metaplant

At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”

The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.

“With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.

CNN has asked Kemp’s office for comment about Thursday’s immigration raid at the Metaplant.

Dozens apprehended in New York raid

In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.

The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.

Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.

“I am outraged by this morning’s ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.

Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”

The new camp is believed to hold about 1,000 people, with expansion to 5,000 in the near future.

According to official statements, the facilities there will be used as short-term processing centers for people in the process of removal, under the responsibility of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Defense only provides the land and logistics.

Funding contracts included $231.8 million, awarded to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a company with no prior experience in such work. The new camp, named Camp East Montana, is temporary on paper, offering even a prayer area for those inside — but in reality it is the largest immigration detainment facility in U.S. history.

Housing migrants on a military base entails a lack of transparency in detention. Fort Bliss is a restricted-access site where journalists, independent observers, and human rights advocates will not be admitted. This creates a “black zone” where those in custody are left without witnesses and without oversight.

For many, it brings back repeated trauma — people who fled wars and prison abuse now return to the sight of barracks, barbed wire, and military vehicles around them. Such placement erases the line between a civilian immigration system and a military prison, creating a model ready for scaling up.

But to house migrants on military bases fits perfectly into the Trump 2.0’s strategy on immigration enforcement. The point is that a show of strength and resolve at the border shifts the immigration issue from a civilian to a militarized domain.

This is first and foremost a signal to voters, especially Republican voters, of “uncompromising and tough control.” Republican governors, especially in Texas and Florida, support the idea, seeing it as a way to bypass restrictions and speed up deportations.

The danger is in making such measures the norm. When military infrastructure starts working for domestic politics, it stops being a crisis-response tool and becomes a permanent element of governance and intimidation. Its further development will only make it harder to return immigration control to civilian institutions.

All this is looking less and less like a tent camp in the desert and more like the birth of a new system. The lack of resistance to it will create a blueprint for national networks of military camps, where law and transparency give way to the discipline of the garrison.

ICE announced in July that immigrants who arrive in the United States illegally will no longer be eligible for bond.

A new class action lawsuit, with the help of immigration attorney Hans Meyer, claims this is not legal.

""Immigration law for 30 years has clearly outlined that people who've lived in the country for a long period of time, if picked up by ICE, are eligible for bond,"" Meyer said. ""What we see now is a new policy by the government with a complete reversal of that position after three decades without any explanation or reason.""

The legal question a judge will need to decide is: ""Should immigrants who are in our country illegally be allowed to ask for bond?""

The lawsuit isn't arguing to release detainees, but that they should have the chance to ask for bond.

""This problem is impacting thousands of people in Colorado. Anybody who lives in this state who entered at any time, no matter how long ago. So, for example, someone who came in when they were two or three years old, grew up here, maybe got DACA status as a young person, and has now been arrested by ICE, for over three decades, that person would be eligible for bond,"" Meyer said.

Class action lawsuit challenges ICE's ""no bond"" policy for detained immigrants

That includes Nestor Mendoza Gutierrez.

He became one of the first to file a case claiming his detention is unlawful, according to Meyer. Now he's the face of the class action lawsuit.

""He's lived in this country for nearly 27 years. He's married, he has children, he's a hard-working person, he pays taxes, so he's fully stable in our community, and he's lived in Colorado, frankly, more than most people who live in this state,"" Meyer said.

The lawsuit could be decided on in a matter of weeks, according to Meyer.

""So the class action lawsuit is designed to address one legal question that applies to 1000s of people. That way, 1000s of people don't have to file separate petitions for Habeas Corpus in the federal courts, and the court can address one legal issue that applies to several 100 and in this case, what will actually be several thousand people,"" he explained.

Denver7 reached out to ICE to ask about the agency's take on the policy change, and what the plan is if detention centers become overcrowded.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments in the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

President Trump is expected to unilaterally reinterpret the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime treaty in order to sell advanced military drones abroad, according to a U.S. official and other sources. Under the plan, the United States will designate drones as aircraft, rather than missile systems, the U.S. official said, adding that the effort is the first part of a planned “major review” of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

The United States will continue to unilaterally “blow up” foreign drug traffickers if needed, but also hopes to do so in collaboration with “friendly governments” that will help the U.S. forces “find these people and blow them up,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday. Separately, Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello described the recent U.S. strike on an alleged drug smuggling vessel as an “extrajudicial killing.” Ione Wells reports for BBC News; John Hudson and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

Rubio also announced that the United States has designated two Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. According to Rubio, the designation brings “all sorts of options” for Washington to work with Ecuador to crack down on the groups. Matthew Lee, Regina Garcia Cano, and Jacquelyn Martin report for AP News.

Two Venezuelan military aircraft yesterday flew near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters in a “highly provocative move” that was “designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations,” the U.S. Defense Department said in a social media statement. Rashard Rose reports for CNN.

The United States has violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by being responsible for an Afghan man’s two-year-long arbitrary detention in Abu Dhabi, a U.N. Human Rights Council Working Group found in an opinion published this week. The man, a former police force colonel who had worked with U.S. forces, was evacuated to the United Arab Emirates during the hurried U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. The Group held the United States and United Arab Emirates jointly responsible for breaching the Covenant. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

The Trump administration is preparing to start renegotiating the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Sources familiar with the administration’s thinking say the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is scheduled to begin public consultations on the free trade agreement within the next month. Gavin Bade, Santiago Pérez, and Vipal Monga report for the Wall Street Journal.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump is expected to nominate Lt. Gen. William Hartman to lead the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, sources say. Hartman has been the acting leader of both agencies since Trump fired Gen. Timothy Haugh from the role in April. Daniel Lippman and Maggie Miller report for POLITICO.

Trump is also set to sign an executive order changing the Department of Defense’s name to the Department of War later today, a senior administration official confirmed. A separate source suggested that the White House is exploring ways to implement the name change without an act of Congress. Paul McLeary, Jack Detsch, Connor O’Brien, and Joe Gould report for POLITICO.

In a pair of whistleblower complaints, two prominent scientists on Wednesday said that they had been removed from National Institutes of Health leadership positions after objecting to the Trump administration’s policies, including efforts to undermine vaccines, evade court orders, withhold research money, and politicize the grant-making process, according to the New York Times. Benjamin Mueller reports.

Trump yesterday expressed support for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, telling leading tech CEOs gathered for dinner at the White House that Kennedy “got some little different ideas” and “we want to listen to all those things.” Ben Johansen reports for POLITICO.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal mortgage fraud investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, U.S. officials say. Brian Schwartz, C. Ryan Barber, and Will Parker report for the Wall Street Journal.

DOJ officials have discussed ways to block transgender individuals from buying guns by leveraging laws that restrict mentally ill people from owning arms in the wake of last week’s Minneapolis shooting, sources say. However, the Justice Department has since assured at least one influential gun rights advocate that it would not be moving forward with the plan, a source adds. Zusha Elinson and C. Ryan Barber report for the Wall Street Journal.

FBI agents seized computers, phones, and a range of documents during their search of the home and office of former national security adviser John Bolton, according to court papers unsealed yesterday. Some of the folders seized by the FBI were labeled “Trump I-IV” and “statements and reflections to allied strikes,” the records suggest. Jeremy Roebuck reports for the Washington Post.

Trump’s pick for the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve’s Board, Stephen Miran, yesterday told the Senate Banking Committee he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his position as the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors while serving out the Fed Governor’s term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. Yun Li reports for CNBC.

Trump is in preliminary stages of exploring ways to take federal control of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, two White House officials suggest. Tyler Pager and Graham Bowley report for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Any Western troops in Ukraine would be legitimate targets for Moscow to attack, especially if they appeared now, Russian President Vladimir Putin said today, adding that he does not “see any sense in their presence” in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday announced that 26 countries had formally committed to providing post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, including through the deployment of troops “by land, sea or air” as part of an international peacekeeping force. Vladimir Soldatkin reports for Reuters; Paul Kirby reports for BBC News.

Sweden’s Transport Agency yesterday issued a statement accusing Russia of being responsible for a significant rise in instances of GPS signal jamming over the Baltic Sea, with the disruption of aviation and shipping communications now being an almost daily occurrence. Aoife Walsh reports for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Trump yesterday told European leaders they are “funding the war” by purchasing Russian oil and must cut Russia off and put economic pressure on China to do the same, according to a White House official. In a press conference after the call, Macron said that if Putin continues to reject peace talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the EU would impose more sanctions in coordination with the United States. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report for Axios.

The Trump administration will not request money to extend security assistance programmes that train and equip armies of Eastern European states bordering Russia, sources say. The spending for the Defense Department programmes is regulated by section 333 of the U.S. Code, and must be approved by Congress. Senate aides estimate that the program currently has a worldwide budget of more than $1bn. The Trump administration has not requested money that would extend the measure beyond the end of September 2026. Amy Mackinnon, Steff Chávez, Abigail Hauslohner, Demetri Sevastopulo, and Henry Foy report for the Financial Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Hamas late on Wednesday expressed readiness for concluding a comprehensive deal to end the Gaza war and release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, after Trump called on the militant group to release all living hostages remaining in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the statement as “spin” and “nothing new.” Adam Rasgon reports for the New York Times.

The death toll of the Israel-Hamas war has passed 64,000 dead, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said yesterday. Separately, an Israeli military spokesperson said yesterday that the Israeli military now controls 40% of Gaza City amid an intensifying offensive. According to local hospitals, Israeli strikes killed 53 people, mostly women and children, overnight into and on Thursday. Wafaa Shurafa, Kareem Chehayeb, and Julia Frankel report for AP News; Steven Scheer and Nidal Al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

The U.S. State Department yesterday announced it is imposing new sanctions on Al Haq, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, three non-governmental organizations that in 2023 asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Israel’s actions in Gaza. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

The United States “told all these countries … if you guys do this [Palestine] recognition stuff it’s all fake, it’s not even real, if you do it you’re going to create problems,” State Secretary Marco Rubio said yesterday. Reuters reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The Lebanese government is running out of time to disarm Hezbollah before risking losing U.S. and Gulf Arab financial support, or a renewed Israeli military campaign, the Trump administration said yesterday. Michael Crowley reports for the New York Times.

The Thai parliament today elected Anutin Charnvirakul as the country’s new prime minister, handing a defeat to the ruling party candidate Chaikasem Nitisiri. Panarat Thepgumpanat and Chayut Setboonsarng report for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Charles McGonigal, a former senior FBI official, “intentionally” compromised a major criminal investigation by tipping off the executives of a Chinese company of their arrests, according to a report released by the FBI Inspector General’s Office yesterday. The new report adds damaging new detail to accusations against McGonigal, who in 2023 pleaded guilty to crimes, including secretly working for a Russian oligarch, and is presently serving a six-year sentence. Tom Winter reports for NBC News; Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

A State Department employee yesterday was sentenced to 48 months in prison for conspiring to collect and transmit national defense information to people who he believed were working with the Chinese government, according to a DOJ press release.

Elias Rodriguez, accused of killing two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, yesterday pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Holmes Lybrand reports for CNN.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is planning to train several hundred armed law enforcement agents to investigate immigration application fraud and arrest those involved, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the agency’s new director, Joe Edlow, the formation of such a team is necessary because ICE does not have the capacity to pursue all cases of immigration fraud. Until now, USCIS was explicitly kept separate from immigration enforcement. Michelle Hackman reports.

The Defense Department has approved the Naval Station Great Lakes base to be used as a staging ground for the Homeland Security Department’s immigration enforcement operations, according to two defense officials. Dan Lamothe and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

The United States and Ecuador are working out the final details of a “safe third country” agreement that would allow the United States to send asylum seekers to Ecuador, a senior State Department official said yesterday. Kylie Atwood reports for CNN.

A federal appeals court yesterday issued a stay to a lower court’s order to end operations indefinitely at the ”Alligator Alcaraz” immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, ruling that it was in the public interest for the facility to continue its operations while proceedings are pending. Mike Schneider reports for AP News.

A different federal appeals court yesterday issued a temporary stay on a district judge’s order imposing restrictions on the activities of National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, pending a detailed hearing on the issue. The appeals court’s order in effect maintains the status quo, as the lower court judge delayed the entry of his order into force to give the administration time to appeal. Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A joint venture between Danish renewable energy giant Orsted and Revolution Wind LLC yesterday filed a lawsuit arguing the Trump administration’s move to halt a nearly finished wind farm off Rhode Island was unlawful and “issued in bad faith.” The Rhode Island and Connecticut Attorneys General indicated they would also file a challenge against the decision. Brad Plumer and Karen Zraick report for the New York Times.

In an emergency filing, the Trump administration yesterday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire the Federal Trade Commission’s Rebecca Slaughter. The dispute will likely lead the Supreme Court to consider the vitality of a 1935 ruling that affirmed the constitutionality of a Congress decision to limit the president’s power to dismiss FTC members to cases of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday filed a lawsuit against Boston, arguing the city’s “sanctuary” policies that limit police cooperation with immigration enforcement officials are unlawful. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

Of course they do. Which you would also know, if you'd read the article, never mind the report.

If you read the article you would have read the paragraph above, which says:

The report also demonstrates that judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK are very rare, and that the Court has only rarely held that the UK government has violated human rights in its immigration-related decisions and policies.

Or even the one above it, which says:

The report shows that reliance on Article 8 in appeals against deportation gained significant attention in media coverage in the first half of 2025. But the possibility of claiming the right to protection of private and family life to prevent deportation is heavily restricted by legislation passed by Parliament...

They are highlighting, correctly, the misrepresentations that immigrants are not being deported because of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, based on the European Convention on Human Rights, rather than the reality that a very small number of immigrants are not being deported because of rulings by UK-based tribunals, applying UK laws - often not even including the Human Rights Act.

To quote the report:

UK immigration law therefore already clearly restricts the application of Article 8 ECHR to the set of circumstances described in [the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002], as set out by Parliament.

i.e. it is misleading to blame the ECHR, and doubly misleading to blame the ECtHR, when the test being applied is a statutory one, separate to the ECHR, passed by Parliament in 2014.

Which you would know, if you read the article or the report.

I'm going to assume you just didn't get around to reading either, and that you weren't deliberately making misrepresentations around human rights and immigration in a thread by some experts calling out people for making misrepresentations around human rights and immigration.

I don't think this article is aimed at them. The report is mostly going through the news reporting in this area, over several months earlier this year, and making a note of all the misrepresentations and errors included.

Obviously if people believe the world is flat telling them they are wrong isn't going to convince them - nor will almost any amount of evidence. At the same time, we shouldn't be listening to what they have to say about anything that relates to the shape of the Earth, because we know it will be based on fundamentally flawed premises.

But a report like this - which helps show why they may believe something that is wrong, what their sources of misinformation are, what lies they are being told - can help us understand where they are coming from and, hopefully, how to fix it (although I'm not sure shutting down the Telegraph is that easy an option).

I constantly see claims that ""if Labour tackle immigration they'll win by a landslide"".

Yet despite them constantly talking about it, they have been going nowhere in the polls. Every time a bit of news comes is released showing a reduction or improvement it is met with cynicism or calls that it is not enough.

I'm not sure what can be done about perception as the mainstream and social media constantly talking about it really warps perspective. We see this with crime, where it is lower now than it was in the past, yet no one seems to believe it.",,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:30.053096

“This ruling is a setback for human rights. “Alligator Alcatraz” is a monument to cruelty and just one of the latest expansions of the Trump administration’s racist, anti-immigrant agenda. “Alligator Alcatraz” should have never existed and since its opening, we’ve been advocating for it to be shut down.

“Beyond the environmental concerns brought in the lawsuit, this facility, carried out in coordination with the state of Florida, is a human rights disaster. The people who have been caged there have gone through hell. Within weeks of starting to detain people, horror stories emerged about dangerous and inhumane conditions including maggot-infested food, overflowing toilets and no working showers, lack of medical care, and virtually no access to lawyers. These conditions are not isolated failures — they are part and parcel of the system designed for cruelty and meant to dehumanize our immigrant friends and neighbors.

“Florida taxpayers are footing the bill for this despicable detention center to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. That money could be going to disaster preparedness or other programs to keep Florida’s communities safe and healthy.

“This federal-state relationship sets a dangerous precedent that invites other states to potentially collaborate with the Trump administration in expanding the reach of his cruel agenda. We’ve already seen this with the likes of “Louisiana Lockup” and “Cornhusker clink” in Nebraska. The very nicknames given to these facilities trivialize the suffering of people who are caught up in President Trump’s cruel agenda. Governors in these states must stop being a player in President Trump’s cruel games.

“Like the rest of President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, expanding immigrant detention centers is a solution in search of a problem. These facilities are as expensive as they are cruel, and do absolutely nothing to keep our communities safe. Our immigrant family members, friends, and neighbors, many of whom came to the U.S. seeking safety and dignity, make our communities stronger and more vibrant. The U.S. government should be meeting them with compassion and support instead of terrorizing entire communities, tearing families apart, and locking them in cages.

“Immigration detention in the U.S. has long been plagued by systemic abuse and a failure to uphold human rights. But President Trump has doubled down and made it his mission to demonize and attack immigrants – he has made cruelty the point. But, he’s out of touch. Recent polling shows that an increasing number of Americans believe his deportation machine has gone too far.

“This ruling is a setback, but we will not stop fighting until the mass detention and deportation machine is dismantled, and immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.”

Trump—who reportedly signed a secret order directing the Pentagon to use military force to combat cartels abroad—said that Tuesday's US strike in international waters killed 11 people. The attack sparked fears of renewed US aggression in a region that has endured well over 100 US interventions over the past 200 years, and against a country that has suffered US meddling since the late 19th century.

""It appears that US forces that were recently sent to the region in an escalatory and provocative manner were under no threat from the boat they attacked,"" Omar cotended.

Omar continued:

They're now using the failed War on Drugs to justify their egregious violation of international law. The US posture towards the eradication of drugs has caused immeasurable damage across our hemisphere. It has led to massive forced displacement, environmental devastation, violence, and human rights violations. What it has not done is any damage whatsoever to narcotrafficking or to the cartels. It has been a dramatic, profound failure at every level. In Latin America, even right-wing presidents acknowledge this is true.

Trump has already asked the supreme court to overturn the lower court ruling in the tariffs case. Almost certain to follow are Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, his hostile conflict with Harvard University and his deployment of the national guard and marines to Los Angeles. All have been deemed unlawful in lower courts.

“It’s simple: the president and his administration continue to do illegal things at an astonishing pace, and so the courts are finding that these things are illegal,” said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

“The president is committed to pursuing his agenda regardless of whether it’s legal or not, and is seeing what he can get away with.”

The ultimate arbiter of that will be the supreme court, which is stacked 6-3 in favor of conservatives, many of whom Trump has appointed. The court has already dramatically limited the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions to pause Trump administration policies across the country.

That has not stopped them from issuing more targeted blocks. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the fifth US circuit court of appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision that the president had unlawfully invoked the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men he alleged were members of a criminal gang. Its preliminary injunction blocked the administration from removing a group of Venezuelans.

The seldom-used act gives the government expansive powers to detain and deport citizens of hostile foreign nations, but only in times of war, or during an “invasion or predatory incursion”. Circuit judge Leslie Southwick rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had engaged in a “predatory incursion” on US soil.

“This is a critically important decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts,” said Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the Venezuelans.

The Trump administration, however, could ask the entire fifth circuit to rehear the case – and it is expected to eventually reach the supreme court.

Also on Tuesday, a federal judge found that Trump had illegally deployed thousands of military troops to Los Angeles in June, and barred the Pentagon from using national guard members and marines to perform police functions, such as arrests and crowd control.

About 300 troops are still on the streets of Los Angeles and Trump is threatening to send more to other Democratic-led cities, including Chicago and Baltimore. Last month, he deployed the national guard to Washington DC, where he has direct legal control, supposedly to crack down on violent crime, which is at a 30-year low in the city.

The judge’s order, set to take effect on 12 September, condemns Trump’s apparent goal of “creating a national police force with the president as its chief”. It was a victory for the California governor, Gavin Newsom, who sued the administration in June, arguing Trump had violated the 1878 law – the Posse Comitatus Act – prohibiting the use of US military troops in domestic law enforcement.

Newsom called Trump’s actions an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism” and an alarming abuse of power. The administration countered that troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws – but the judge disagreed, ruling the deployment illegal.

A day later, a different federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully terminated about $2.6bn in grants awarded to Harvard University, and ordered it to reverse funding cuts to the prestigious Ivy League school. It marked a major legal victory for the nation’s oldest university. The judge said the administration’s actions constituted illegal retaliation after Harvard refused the White House’s demands to change its policies and governance.

In a separate case, the judge had already barred the administration from halting Harvard’s ability to enrol international students, who comprise about a quarter of its student body.

Just as Trump used the Alien Enemies Act in the context of a wider move to deport millions of people, and used troops on US soil as part of a wider authoritarian crackdown, Harvard was another test case – this time as part of Trump’s effort to leverage federal funding to force ideological changes at American universities.

Each of the cases, Sherman said, attempt to push the boundaries of what’s allowable by “brazenly violating the law”.

“He’s attempting to do things knowing that it’s illegal, knowing it would have to go to court to be challenged,” he said. “It is monumentally stupid.”

But it also presents a significant challenge for individuals and organizations forced to sue, Sherman adds – and for the courts themselves, which must keep up with the volume of lawsuits.

“They are breaking laws that are clearly written and understood, and it’s creating strain on other institutions who are struggling to keep up.”

Now Trump has asked the supreme court to review the tariff defeat after the ruling that he had overstepped his presidential powers when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country. In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that, while US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes.

The ultimate decision on many, if not all, of these cases will probably be made by the supreme court. With its rulings on presidential immunity and other key conservative opinions, Trump has “indications from the supreme court that, despite what the law says, he can do what he wants,” Sherman said.

“That has informed his approach since he’s been back in office,” he added. “He seems to be unencumbered by what the law is and what the law requires.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95ebe248f92ff84bc04801a5e296e346e92c01f/337_176_2417_1934/master/2417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcfe36b3d0ba21fd3da237620281c270",N,,2025-09-05 07:57:11.429080

Officials confirmed on September 3 that 51 male immigrant detainees had already been transferred to Angola, with plans to exceed 200 by month’s end. The immigrant detention facility within Angola can hold up to 400. According to the governor, those held there will be kept “completely isolated” from the general prison population, under the control of ICE contractors.

In remarks to the press made on Wednesday, September 3, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the Trump administration deliberately picked one of Louisiana’s most infamous prisons to cage immigrant detainees as a scare tactic to push undocumented immigrants into “self-deporting.”

“Angola prison is legendary, but that’s a message that these individuals that are gonna be here, that are illegal criminals, need to understand,” Noem told press in front of the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary, speaking behind a podium bearing the sign “Louisiana Lockup Angola”.

Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola prison is the nation’s largest maximum-security lockup. It sits on the grounds of the former Angola slave plantation, from which it takes its name.

As Noem described, Angola does indeed have a “legendary” reputation, one which includes human rights abuses and slave-like conditions. In September 2024, prisoners launched a class-action lawsuit over Angola’s brutal forced farm labor. The prison’s mostly Black inmates are still compelled to pick cotton in the same fields once worked by enslaved people – often under sweltering, dangerous heat.

“If you don’t think that they belong in somewhere like this,” said Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana at the news conference on Wednesday, referring to the immigrants to be detained at Angola – “you’ve got a problem.”

Prisoners forced to work farm labor at Angola have raised the alarm about their grueling labor conditions. “It is the only job that you are forced to have a gun pointed at you,” Patrick Jones said in a testimony in a federal courtroom back in April of this year. “You are forced to be talked to like you are less than a human being.”

Trump expands mass deportation machine with new ICE prisons and raids

The conversion of Angola prison into an immigration detention site is part of a major goal of the Trump administration: an aggressive expansion of the deportation system through both state-run and privately operated facilities, as Trump seeks to meet mass deportation goals. In 2024, Trump made a central campaign pledge to launch the largest mass deportation operation in US history, vowing to remove an estimated 15 to 20 million people.

In May, the Trump administration set an aggressive new goal for immigration enforcement arrests: Axios reported that during a May 21 meeting, Trump advisor Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pressed federal immigration agents to ramp up enforcement, setting a target of 3,000 arrests per day.

Since then, the Trump administration has ramped up militarized ICE raids, igniting mass protest and opposition across the country as immigrant workers are violently ripped from their families and communities.",https://peoplesdispatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louisiana-state-penitentiary.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:36.754425

NPR asked immigration law experts to explain what we know is and isn't legal when it comes to immigration enforcement.
Immigration agents can, and have, made arrests in those types of areas, such as the lobby of an apartment building that's open to the public or parking lots.
However, ICE agents have used deceptive practices to gain entry into a person's home or business to make arrests without a warrant, according to a lawsuit filed in 2020 against DHS.
ICE had not responded to NPR's question on this tactic or questions on whether their use of force policy has changed.","Masked, plain-clothed agents are grabbing people they believe are undocumented immigrants off the streets, pulling them into unmarked vehicles and swiftly detaining them.

In other cases, masked agents are running checkpoints in the middle of Washington, D.C., and in L.A., and questioning people in their cars.

And in some situations, agents are smashing the windows of those cars in order to pull a person out.

Immigration agents are often given wide latitude in their work. That means a lot of what the public has been witnessing since President Trump took office — and may be shocked by — is likely legal.

But what is allowable is becoming more unclear as these tactics test the limits of the law, according to immigration law experts.

""In that sense it is a very confusing time for lawyers and the public alike,"" says Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA School of Law's Center for Immigration Law & Policy.

NPR asked immigration law experts to explain what we know is and isn't legal when it comes to immigration enforcement.

Q. Federal law gives immigration officials power to arrest and question immigrants. What are those powers? Can they make arrests without warrants?

U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement, the agency in charge of immigration enforcement, was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Congress gave the burgeoning agency wide power to question, search and arrest immigrants, or those believed to be immigrants, without a warrant.

In the past, that has looked like investigative police work and arresting specific targets in specific locations, says Nithya Nathan-Pineau, a policy attorney and strategist at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a nonprofit that advocates for immigrants' rights.

The Immigration and Nationality Act states that in order to arrest someone without a warrant, officers must have cause, or reasonable suspicion, to believe that a person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.

""Leaving aside border checkpoints, immigration officers have power to consensually question anyone, just like a police officer does; but to detain someone even briefly they require individualized suspicion that the person is violating the immigration laws,"" UCLA's Arulanantham says.

In the past, immigration officers would look for specific people who had, say, a final removal order issued against them or someone who was convicted of a crime – something that would render an individual deportable, Arulanantham says.

Now, in some cases immigration officers are executing major dragnets and arresting large groups of people and then determining if each person is in the U.S. illegally by interrogating them after they've been stopped.

That happened in Los Angeles this summer, when immigration agents stopped people based on their perceived race or ethnicity, according to a lawsuit filed by ACLUSoCal, among others. The plaintiffs argue these actions violate the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy against unreasonable searches and seizures.

A federal court agreed, ruling that agents can't rely on factors such as race, speaking Spanish, wearing workman-like clothes, and location (being present at places such as carwashes or Home Depot parking lots) to meet the standard of ""individualized suspicion.""

What is supposed to happen and what is happening are two different things, however.

""In the last few weeks it seems that immigration enforcement officers appear to be flouting the judge's order, perhaps because the case is now at the Supreme Court,"" Arulanantham says.

ICE didn't respond to NPR's questions on how it addresses the individualized suspicion metric.

Q. Are immigration enforcement agents allowed to wear masks or otherwise refuse to identify themselves?

The widespread masking of immigration agents in the streets and even in federal courthouses has stoked fear among immigrant communities and strong objections from civil rights groups. But acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, has said it's a necessary response to what he describes as efforts to dox and threaten these agents and their families. ICE has said there has been a dramatic increase in the doxing of agents but has not said how many cases there have been or provided any details. The agency has not provided any information to support their assertion of an increase in agent doxxing.

But Nathan-Pineau says this violates a federal requirement that immigration agents identify themselves as agents as soon as it is ""practical"" and ""safe"" to do so during an arrest. (They are not, however, required to provide their personal names.) She says the regulation is interpreted as agents are allowed not to identify themselves during emergency situations where they have to work fast. But she says she doesn't think the current situation constitutes an emergency that would justify agents not identifying what agency they work for.

At the time of publication ICE had not responded to NPR's question on how the ""emergency"" element had been defined previously, or whether it has changed, or whether agents not identifying themselves is consistent with policy.

While ICE leadership has endorsed agents' use of masks, and the federal law doesn't mention the use of masks explicitly, there are efforts by lawmakers across the country to bar federal agents from hiding their faces outside of medical or tactical reasons or for undercover work. But there are no current laws requiring agents to show their faces.

Q. Where can officers make arrests? Can they arrest people in their home or a private business?

Immigration officers must have a warrant to arrest people at private businesses or homes. However, there are areas outside homes or in and around apartment buildings and businesses that can be considered public spaces. Immigration agents can, and have, made arrests in those types of areas, such as the lobby of an apartment building that's open to the public or parking lots.

Private businesses have the right to decline entry to ICE.

However, ICE agents have used deceptive practices to gain entry into a person's home or business to make arrests without a warrant, according to a lawsuit filed in 2020 against DHS. This has included ICE agents wearing vests that say ""POLICE"" and misrepresenting themselves as police or probation officers to trick people into allowing them into their homes or businesses. Four years later, a federal court ruled against this practice called 'knock and talk,' putting a stop to it.

Adding to the confusion, by both subjects of investigations and bystanders, is the fact that ICE agents occasionally take part in broader criminal investigations Similarly, there are rules governing law enforcement's right to search and question a person.

At border checkpoints, like at airports or land crossings, agents have wide latitude to ask questions, search people and detain individuals, Arulanantham says. Otherwise, it's important to understand the difference between a consensual encounter with immigration agents, where people have the right to leave the conversation, and actual detention.

""The first question anyone should ask if they feel uncomfortable when approached by any officer is 'Am I free to leave?' If the officer says they are, then they should exercise their right to leave,"" Arulanantham says. ""If the officer tries not to answer, the individual should repeat the question until they get a response.""

""If the officer says 'No,' then the person should not resist, but need not cooperate in any other way,"" he continues. ""So they need not answer any questions.""

In general, a person doesn't need to cooperate in any search if officers do not have a warrant, Arulanantham says.

Q. What are the rules on use of force?

Immigration agents are allowed by law to use force when they have ""reasonable grounds to believe that such force is necessary,"" according to DHS policy.

However, the law states an immigration officer should ""always use the minimum non-deadly force necessary to accomplish the officer's mission and shall escalate to a higher level of non-deadly force only when such higher level of force is warranted …""

And DHS policy encourages agents to use de-escalation techniques, less-lethal force and less-lethal devices, such as pepper spray and flashbang grenades, in achieving their goals. And they are to only use force that is ""objectively reasonable.""

It's unclear what the agency considers ""objectively reasonable,"" says Nathan-Pineau.

There have been dozens of recorded instances where agents have smashed car windows in order to pull out suspects. ProPublica reported nearly 50 such instances across the country in the first six months of President Trump's second term.

The government keeps ""no relevant statistics"" on how common this tactic was previously, according to the outlet. ICE had not responded to NPR's question on this tactic or questions on whether their use of force policy has changed.

""The tremendous use of force that is being used to arrest people is honestly really disturbing to watch,"" Nathan-Pineau says, citing the incidents of window smashing and agents tackling people in public.

And it's been difficult to determine whether ICE has made changes in its use-of-force policy, she says. ""Because the most recent policy that we can find certainly says that the type of force that we're seeing is for emergency situations."" Nathan-Pineau says it's helpful that bystanders are increasingly recording these interactions with immigration authorities, but she has seen that immigration officers are intimidating and even arresting these public observers of raids.

That is happening, Arulanantham says, even though federal law allows bystanders the right to record ""so long as they are not interfering with the arrest.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2Fb8%2F92f94b464ddd9f403673c9b55779%2Fap25227689659515.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 07:57:01.937309

On May 16, 2023, Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) announced the implementation of the Family Expedited Removal Management (FERM) Program. This program created a streamlined process for certain families who entered the United States seeking asylum at the Southwest border to be placed in expedited removal proceedings.

The Council submitted a request for records under FOIA on November 21, 2023, and a subsequent lawsuit under FOIA on April 5, 2024. For more information on the request and lawsuit, see the text below.

Key Developments

The Council obtained these important records:

FERM Concept Operations Report

Includes information stating that some people enrolled in FERM were granted parole under a “significant public benefit.”

If individuals enrolled in FERM were paroled, they may be covered under the benefits of CHIRLA v. Noem.

FERM Processing Memo

Includes: References to units that maintained FERM data. The government in the FOIA litigation claimed it did not maintain data on the program.

FERM Participant Guide

Redacted in its totality because the program was run by BI, and the government claimed that the materials included in the guide were exempted under Section 552(b)(4), which applies to trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.

Obtaining the Information

November 21, 2023 – The Council and AILA File FOIA Requests Seeking Information on FERM Program

The lack of transparency from the government prompted the Council and AILA to file a FOIA request seeking further information about FERM and the agency’s goal to place families on expedited removal track. The agencies involved failed to publicize the criteria to place families in the program.

The FOIA request sought both ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) information about the program and data about the families enrolled. Specifically, the requesters asked for:

Records on the criteria the agencies use to enroll families in the FERM program, including the list of nationalities who may be subject to FERM and the cities where it operates.

Documents and information given to families about the program, including information about access to legal representation.

Demographic data on the families placed in FERM.

April 5, 2024 – The Council Files Lawsuit to Get Records about FERM

Since neither ICE nor CBP responded to the request the Council filed a lawsuit on April 5 to compel disclosure. In December 2024, ICE began providing the Council with productions on FERM.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/logo-aic-social.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 07:57:17.960870

Here’s what you can do:

Write to the ICE Atlanta Acting Field Office Director urging her to use her prosecutorial discretion to:

Release Timofei now so he can get the urgent medical care he needs.

Seeking safety in the U.S.

Timofei Kocheshkov, 21, is a Russian national who fled Russia with his parents and older brother, Vadim, in 2024 to seek political asylum. Timofei and Vadim entered the United States in May 2024 through California with a CBP One appointment. Despite following the process, both brothers were detained immediately and sent to the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, California.

In the fall of 2024, the brothers were transferred to the Folkston Detention Center in Georgia. Their parents remain detained in Arizona.

Denial of medical care

Timofei was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of five. Since being transferred to Folkston, he has not received proper glucose monitoring, insulin, or adequate food. This neglect has had a severe impact on his health.

In his affidavit and incident reports, Timofei detailed repeated misdiagnoses, being given the wrong type of insulin, and long delays in accessing medical care. He explained:

“Every time I ask for medical help, I have to wait weeks to see a doctor. Doctors have told me that they cannot treat me properly in here. My life every day is closer to hell. My limbs might be amputated; I may fall into a coma and die.”

His brother Vadim added: “I don’t know how to encourage him anymore, every day it is breaking him down both mentally and physically.”

History of abuse at Folkston

Folkston Detention Center has a troubling record. In November 2021, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general visited the facility after complaints about conditions. Their investigation included interviews with staff and detained individuals, as well as a review of medical records.

The report to Congress documented numerous abuses “that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees.”

Growing detention system

Folkston is run by the private prison company GEO Group, which was recently awarded a $47 million contract to expand operations. The expansion will turn the facility into part of a nearly 3,000-bed complex, making it the largest immigrant detention centre in the United States.

This comes amid a broader surge in immigration detention. From June 2024 to June 2025, the number of people in ICE custody increased by 40 percent, reaching an average of 56,000 people per day — the highest in U.S. history.

The passage of the 2025 Reconciliation Bill, also known as Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” increased ICE’s budget to $150 billion. This expansion is fuelling mass detention and deportation at the expense of people’s health and human rights. It is vital to hold facilities accountable and to release people like Timofei so they can access the medical care they need to survive.",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/urgent-action-network-graphic.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 07:57:06.446488

Last week, the White House told Congress that it intended to cancel $4.9 billion that lawmakers had appropriated for foreign aid programs, invoking a little-known and legally untested power to cut spending without their approval. The move, known as a “pocket rescission,” is essentially a last-minute attempt to claw back money at the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.

Mr. Trump’s long-running effort to freeze foreign aid has plunged programs aimed at responding to humanitarian disasters and disease prevention into chaos. Deprived of funding, foreign aid groups that fight starvation, run medical trials and help war refugees have been forced to freeze services, lay off essential employees or shut down altogether.

On Wednesday, Judge Amir H. Ali of Federal District Court in Washington, a Biden appointee, said he was deeply skeptical of the administration’s arguments that it had the power to not spend money appropriated by law. Judge Ali wrote that the government had changed its stated rationale for canceling foreign aid several times over months of court battles, and did so again in arguments for this case.

“Even having changed their position,” Judge Ali wrote in his 43-page opinion, “there is not a plausible interpretation of the statutes that would justify the billions of dollars they plan to withhold.""

He continued: “Whatever the reason, defendants have given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress’s appropriations must be followed.”

Judge Ali’s ruling comes just days after the federal appeals court in Washington declined to block Mr. Trump’s effort to withhold foreign aid spending, but then remanded the case to the district court for further consideration. Writing that the case “raises questions of immense legal and practical importance,” Judge Ali ruled that the Trump administration must unfreeze the money appropriated for foreign aid and spend it unless Congress acts first to claw the funds back.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/31/multimedia/04trump-news-foreign-aid1/31usaid-world-1-kbtg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 06:57:22.150087

President Trump signed an executive order in April targeting sanctuary cities that don't comply with his agenda of cracking down on undocumented immigrants.

Driving the news: The lawsuit accuses Boston officials of refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, resulting in the release of ""dangerous criminals"" from police custody who would otherwise be subject to removal.

Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement accused the city of Boston and Wu of being ""among the worst sanctuary offenders in America"" by explicitly enforcing policies that she said were ""designed to undermine law enforcement"" and protect undocumented immigrants from justice.

Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311970929.html,"Cecilia’s teenage daughter fled to South Florida in April 2018 after the so-called colectivos and the National Guard assaulted her.
Wednesday’s announcement sets the expectation that, barring a judge’s intervention, about 253,000 Venezuelans will lose their TPS protections by Sept. 10.
However, the Trump administration has said it’s too dangerous for Americans to go there.
Advocates and TPS holders told the Herald they never expected a positive decision from the Trump administration, and had expected Noem to end the protections altogether.
In South Florida, he could give his 15-year-old daughter a better education and a brighter future.","In Venezuela, Cecilia was a veteran government worker who loved working in the tax department and training future generations of civil servants. But she opposed Nicolás Maduro’s government, she says, and assisted the local opposition from the shadows. When a pro-Maduro paramilitary group saw her at a protest, they began stalking her outside her home and on the streets.

Cecilia’s teenage daughter fled to South Florida in April 2018 after the so-called colectivos and the National Guard assaulted her. Cecilia followed eight months later, after finishing treatment for breast cancer and hiding out in family members’ homes.

When the Biden administration granted deportation protections and work permits to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in 2021, Cecilia had already applied for asylum. ButTemporary Protected Status was a welcome relief.

“It’s like when it rains and you have boots and a poncho. It’s another layer of protection for your immigration process,” she said.

Unless a court intervenes, those protections are now set to disappear in just a few days for Cecilia and hundreds of thousands of other Venezuelans living in the United States. President Donald Trump set the TPS protection to end on its original expiration date on Sept. 10, after rolling back a Biden-era extension through October 2026. The decision, coupled with others targeting Venezuelan immigrants, leaves scores of people to face an uncertain future, particularly in South Florida, home to the largest number of TPS recipients in the entire country.

READ MORE: Trump ends TPS deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans

In South Florida, Cecilia – whom the Miami Herald is identifying by her middle name because she is afraid she’ll be kidnapped or disappeared in Venezuela if deported – has continued working in public service. She’s a hotline operator that connects the recently-arrived to social services and helps immigrants do their taxes. She recently bought a home in the Homestead area and aspires to become a financial coach that helps vulnerable communities develop financial literacy. But the possibility of being sent back to a country where she fears her life is at risk has weighed heavily on her mind since President Donald Trump began his second term.

“There’s no justice system over there.There is too much risk of ending up in the dungeons,” she said.

Since 2015, over 7 million people have left Venezuela. Many landed in Florida, where 57 percent of TPS recipients are Venezuelan.

Wednesday’s announcement sets the expectation that, barring a judge’s intervention, about 253,000 Venezuelans will lose their TPS protections by Sept. 10. The decision follows an action by the Trump administration in February to strip another 352,000 Venezuelans of their protected status, granted in 2023, based on the argument that it wasn’t in American interests to keep the program in place.

“We have paid our taxes, we have maintained a completely clean record, and we have worked hard to move forward,” said Carlos Briceño, a TPS beneficiary and project manager in the roofing industry who came to Miami from Venezuela nearly a decade ago. He’s the father of eight-year-old twins, born here. “We have two American daughters who are extremely worried.”

A fierce legal battle

Congress created Temporary Protected Status in 1990 for nationals of countries in turmoil, like ongoing wars or natural disasters. To be eligible, people must already be in the United States before a certain cutoff date, be fingerprinted, have no felonies on record and pass background checks.

President Joe Biden granted Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela in 2021, citing the acute poverty, economic contraction, repressive governance, human rights abuses, collapsing infrastructure, inadequate healthcare, widespread crime, food insecurity and lack of basic services in the country. In 2023, he expanded the designation so more Venezuelans could qualify for the benefit.

But only days after Trump’s return to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security announced that “notable improvements” in areas like the economy, public health, and crime made it possible for Venezuelans to be safely returned to their home country. However, the Trump administration has said it’s too dangerous for Americans to go there. A “Do not travel” advisory from the State Department warns of wrongful detentions, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and more.

The National Alliance, along with several TPS recipients from Venezuela, sued the Trump administration in San Francisco after it first announced it would end Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans under the 2023 designation in February. In March, federal judge Edward M. Chen of the Northern District of California issued a preliminary order upholding TPS for the group, whose protections were set to expire in April, and restored TPS for Venezuelans until October 2026. Chen wrote in his decision that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had made “sweeping negative generalizations” when ending Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status, and described “acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype” as a “classic example of racism.”

The Trump administration submitted an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to intervene in the case. The nation’s highest court ruled in May that the administration could end TPS but did not stop ongoing litigation or weigh in on the merits of Chen’s case However, the Supreme Court decision left the vast majority of Venezuelans under the 2023 designation without any TPS protections. Last week, an appeals court affirmed Chen’s authority, upheld his March order and ruled that Homeland Security had improperly ended the protections.

Advocates and TPS holders told the Herald they never expected a positive decision from the Trump administration, and had expected Noem to end the protections altogether. Homeland Security said that it had weighed public safety, national security, migration patterns and other factors, and concluded the deportation protections for Venezuelans did not benefit the United States. A DHS spokesperson said TPS had a “clear magnet effect” for Venezuelans, though people who come after designation cut-off dates cannot benefit from TPS.

Now, the fate of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans depends on how Chen rules on the case.

“We’re waiting on that decision to come out any time now,” said Jose Palma, co-coordinator and spokesperson of the National TPS Alliance.

Over the last year, the Trump administration has also moved to revoke Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras — all countries whose difficult conditions on the ground have led to the settlement of sizable immigrant communities in South Florida.

“We’re talking about long-term contributors to our community who are being targeted. It’s deeply concerning,” said Sui Chung, executive director for Miami-based Americans for Immigrant Justice.

“An existential crisis”

To understand how the Trump administration’s posture toward Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans is playing out in South Florida, the Herald spoke with attorneys, advocates and immigrants, several of whom asked that their names be withheld for fear of persecution.

David — who asked to be identified by his first name because of the delicate situation with TPS in the United States and the possibility of repercussions in Venezuela — came to the United States in February 2021 to visit friends and family in the United States on a tourist visa. While he was here, Biden issued the first TPS designation for Venezuela. A long-time engineering professor, he said he decided to stay. In South Florida, he could give his 15-year-old daughter a better education and a brighter future.

David, who works in the tourism industry, said he understands why Trump wants to crack down on irregular immigration. But he told the Herald that there are hard-working professionals getting tangled in the wider immigration enforcement net his administration has cast for immigration enforcement. Already, the Miami resident said he’s been having difficulties renewing his license, which is vital for his job. Ahead of the expiration of his TPS next week, he fears being separated from his daughter, who has a pathway to permanent residency and is applying.

“Please give us another opportunity, evaluate who is doing things wrong and who is doing things right in this country. And those who are doing things right want to continue contributing to society and to the world,” he told the Herald. “Los buenos somos más.” The good people are the majority.

JB Pritzker said Thursday all indications continue to show federal agents fully assembling Friday in Chicagoland, with immigration enforcement possibly beginning as early as Friday or Saturday.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports as many as 300 ICE agents could be deployed to take part in the operation.

Pritzker fears President Donald Trump’s strategy of sending federal troops to Chicagoland is to cause “mayhem” on the ground, which could lead to expanded operations.

“Part of their nefarious plan is to begin with ICE, causing mayhem on the ground and by doing that, say that there’s a need for military troops on the ground to protect ICE,” Pritzker said.

Despite the looming threat, the governor said he is not telling people to stay home, but to be aware of their surroundings as Chicagoans hold and attend Mexican independence celebrations.

“Don’t play into their hands, but if you have the opportunity please protest. Pull out your phone. Video everything they’re doing,” Pritzker said, adding that Illinois will fight the battle in the courts. “I’m not intimidated. No one should be.”

Like the governor, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is urging the public to protest or interact with ICE agents peacefully.

“Why would we allow someone who is auditioning to be a dictator of a democracy to intimidate the soul of America, the city of Chicago? We should celebrate. I’m going to celebrate,” Johnson said.

Pritzker also recently went to Berwyn and met with administrators and teachers and Prairie Oak Elementary School in an effort to establish school action plans in the event ICE agents show up at their door.

According to the governor’s office, schools should establish a point person or department where ICE personnel should be directed. School officials should track and review all records requests or subpoenas arriving from ICE or other related authorities.

Faculty, staff and administrators should be trained to implement school policy in case of immigration enforcement action.

Parents are also encouraged to keep their child(ren)’s emergency contacts updated and accurate.

Both Pritzker and Johnson scoffed at Trump’s campaign fundraising email, saying, “Chicago will be liberated.”

“It just shows you how politicized this is being made. Trump and his Republicans don’t want to solve issues in our country,” Johnson said.

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington ruled Wednesday that the Republican administration's decision to withhold the funding was likely illegal. He issued a preliminary injunction ordering the release of $11.5 billion that is set to expire at the end of the month.

“To be clear, no one disputes that Defendants have significant discretion in how to spend the funds at issue, and the Court is not directing Defendants to make payments to any particular recipients,” wrote Ali, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden. “But Defendants do not have any discretion as to whether to spend the funds.”

The administration filed a notice of appeal on Thursday.

“President Trump has the executive authority to ensure that all foreign aid is accountable to taxpayers and aligns with the America First priorities people voted for,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.

Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, president and CEO of Global Health Council, one of the groups in the case, said in a statement the decision was a victory for “the rule of law"" and reaffirmed that “only Congress controls the power of the purse.""

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter on Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That is when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years that a president has used the tactic. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

Ali said Congress would have to approve the rescission proposal for the administration to withhold the money.

The law is “explicit that it is congressional action—not the President’s transmission of a special message—that triggers rescission of the earlier appropriations,” he wrote.

The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs. Trump has portrayed the funding as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals, and in January, he issued an executive order directing the State Department and USAID to freeze spending on foreign aid.

Nonprofit organizations that sued the government said the freeze shut down funding for urgent lifesaving programs abroad.

A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled last month that the administration could suspend the money. The judges later revised that opinion, reviving the lawsuit before Ali.

In his ruling, Ali said he understood that his decision would not be the last word in the case, adding that “definitive higher court guidance now will be instructive.”

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

Donald Trump is on a losing streak this week. Just look at the latest judicial decisions challenging his policies, from mass deportations to tariffs to his troop deployments to US cities. The courts are proving to be a significant check on Trump’s thirst for absolute power.

These cases illustrate the point:

Immigration

Over Labor Day weekend, ICE attempted to begin deporting up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. In the dead of night, the first children were loaded onto planes in south Texas. “These are unaccompanied children who do not have a parent or a guardian with them,” Efrén Olivares, an attorney representing the minors, said on the Democracy Now! news hour.

At 1am on Sunday morning, Olivares and his colleagues filed an emergency complaint with the federal court in Washington, DC. Judge Sparkle Sooknanam was woken after 2am, and by 4am she issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations until the children had the immigration hearings to which they have a legal right.

Meanwhile in Texas, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation’s most conservative, ruled that Trump’s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport people was illegal.

Tariffs

The Appeals Court in Washington DC ruled that Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were illegal and unconstitutional, noting that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs. The ruling was “a sweeping decision that unequivocally rebukes President Trump’s idea that he can impose tariffs on American consumers on his own,” Neal Katyal, the attorney who argued the case, said on Democracy Now!

Domestic Deployment of the Military

Trump says, “We’re going in,” threatening to invade Chicago using, among other forces, the Texas National Guard.

But in California, a federal judge, invoking the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act that bars the use of military in domestic law enforcement, ruled in favor of Governor Gavin Newsom, finding Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles, along with several hundred US Marines, was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of retired US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from “deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops [from] engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

These are just a few of the recent court cases that have rebuked Trump as he attempts to subvert the US Constitution.

We recently got a personal glimpse into what judicial wins over Trump look like. In the high mountain air of Telluride, Colorado, we had a chance to spend time with E. Jean Carroll, the renowned advice columnist and journalist. She was at the Telluride Film Festival for the premier of the new documentary, “Ask E. Jean.”

Carroll had a long and storied career as the advice columnist for Elle Magazine, and has published several books. In recent years she became known as one of the most prominent women to accuse Donald Trump of sexual abuse, saying he raped her in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s, in Manhattan.

Carroll sued Trump in civil court, and a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing her. Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote, “Trump did in fact ‘rape’ Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood.” She was awarded a $5 million settlement from Trump. After the verdict, he called her a liar. She then sued for defamation, and won an additional jury award of $83.3 million.

Carroll cut an elegant figure, walking along Telluride’s main avenue with the sweeping Continental Divide as a backdrop. Her film premiered to rave reviews, and, should there remain a film distributor in this country not cowed by threats of lawsuits from Trump, it should be available for viewing by a wide audience. The film highlights the story of one courageous woman refusing to be defined as a victim of Donald Trump, providing inspiration, no doubt, to the hundreds of survivors of Trump’s old friend, the now-dead sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. Many of them spoke this week outside the US Capitol, demanding the full release of the Epstein files. The Trump administration, which controls the files, is resisting.

Behind each lawsuit are impacted people, whether immigrant children pulled from their beds in the middle of the night and thrown on planes, or people standing up in the streets of LA confronting illegally deployed troops, whether sexual abuse survivors banding together, or federal workers fired en masse.

The courts are playing a central role in opposing the lawless Trump administration, but the core of the resistance are people–people at every level organized in opposition, defending democracy.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/blog_posts/16/78816/full_hd/trumpfrown-83f7w8dpxjd6fk5u98yk9m3fua.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 04:57:35.375995

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village’s roughly 8,000 residents this week that the Trump administration told village officials that a two-story building used to temporarily hold immigrants before they’re detained or deported will serve as the “primary processing location” for the expected operation.

She said local leaders were told the operation will last approximately 45 days, but she didn’t say when it might start.

Officials in the village just west of Chicago declined to elaborate Thursday, saying they were focused on the safety of residents, police and businesses.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,” said LeTisa Jones, the village administrator. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

President Donald Trump has targeted Chicago and other Democrat-led cities for expanded federal intervention. His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in the Windy City, as he did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops to help fight crime. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital.

Although details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, local opposition is already widespread and is building in the suburbs. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.

Activists, church groups and schools in the nation’s third-largest city have been preparing for the operation, during which the Department of Homeland Security intends to use a naval station north of Chicago for logistical support.

In Chicago, organizers postponed a downtown Mexican Independence Day festival scheduled for later this month because of fears in the community about the planned immigration crackdown. They did not set a new date.

In suburban communities, officials also tried to quell concerns.

“We understand that these developments have created anxiety and uncertainty for many in our community,” read a statement from the city of North Chicago and Lake County. “While these developments may feel unsettling, please know this: you are not alone.”

Others issued reminders of Illinois’ sanctuary laws, which are among the strongest in the country and generally bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.

Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, a frequent critic and target of Trump, visited a school Thursday in Berwyn, a largely Latino suburb of roughly 55,000 people, to assess the impact of the expected operation.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

“That means using a human rights approach to public policy, protecting the most vulnerable, and matching words with action.","The federal government under Prime Minister Mark Carney must change course and reverse the declining state of human rights protection in Canada, Amnesty International Canada warned on Thursday.

Reacting to the first 100 days of Canada’s 45th Parliament, the human rights watchdog called on the federal government to enact policy changes in three priority areas — Indigenous rights, refugee rights, and upholding international law — where the need to correct course is especially urgent

“Since the opening of Parliament on May 26, the Canadian government has championed legislative changes that undermine the rights of Indigenous Nations and threaten to put refugees at risk, while failing to stop the ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking section. “One hundred days later, the most vulnerable are at greater risk.

“Economic recovery is a clear priority for this government, but it cannot be pursued at the expense of human rights,” she said. “A just economy creates opportunity and protects those at the margins of society. This has not been the case in the past 100 days, but it is not too late for the government to backtrack and lead on human rights. Doing so will require urgent, decisive action.”

Pushing back against escalating threats to Indigenous rights

Canada’s response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has sidelined Indigenous Nations’ territorial rights. Pro-development bills passed in British Columbia and Ontario this spring gave provincial leaders new powers to push through major infrastructure and mining projects without meaningful community consultation and environmental assessments. Indigenous leaders have rightly denounced the bills, which undermine Indigenous Nations’ right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) over building projects that affect their territories. The right to FPIC is enshrined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

The federal government exacerbated the crisis by passing the Building Canada Act. The legislation gives cabinet the power to designate projects such as ports, pipelines and dams as being in the “national interest,” allowing them to speed through or bypass environmental assessments and consultation processes. Indigenous leaders across the country have also condemned the bill and the government’s failure to adequately consult Indigenous Nations on its development.

“Ontario’s Bill 5, British Columbia’s Bill 15, and Ottawa’s Bill C-5 represent an orchestrated attack on Indigenous Nations’ rights,” said Nivyabandi. “They are interwoven, interdependent, mutually reinforcing, crafted from the same painful colonial pattern that has, for centuries, dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of their lands and denied their sovereignty.”

Amnesty International Canada calls on the federal government to repeal the Building Canada Act without delay; or substantially amend the legislation to ensure the respect of FPIC and other protections. Any replacement must: embed FPIC as a binding precondition; restore independent environmental assessments and cumulative effects analysis; mandate the publication of clear criteria and reasons for “national interest” designations; and guarantee judicial review and public participation, including Indigenous-led review mechanisms. In addition, Amnesty urges the government to, to the best of its ability, ensure that provinces do not undermine constitutional protections of Indigenous rights, UNDRIP obligations, or international human rights standards and instead actively support Indigenous jurisdiction and decision-making as the foundation of reconciliation.

“Upholding Indigenous rights is not a barrier to shared prosperity — it’s foundational to it,” said Nivyabandi. “If we are serious about confronting climate change and securing a brighter future for everyone, the path forward must be rooted in respect for Indigenous Peoples, environmental responsibility, and human rights. Canada cannot build a just and sustainable economy while sidelining the very Nations that have stewarded these lands for centuries.”

Upholding refugees’ rights

During the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Mark Carney campaign vowed to “[maintain] Canada’s global leadership in prioritizing the world’s most vulnerable, including human rights defenders and refugees.” In practice, the government has proposed sweeping legislation that would prevent some people from having their claims for refugee protection fairly assessed. If passed as is, Bill C-2 would effectively prevent a person who, for example, entered Canada three years ago as a child, from having a refugee claim heard by Canadian immigration two decades from now – even if the person’s life circumstances had changed radically and they found themselves in grave danger in their home country.

Moreover, Canada is already imperiling refugees’ rights by sending people back to the U.S. knowing they will face detention and the risk of deportation to countries where they will be persecuted. Amnesty International has repeatedly condemned the U.S. government’s vicious crackdown on refugees and their rights. Through a series of executive orders and other measures, the Trump administration has made it virtually impossible for people to seek asylum in the United States. Refugee claimants already in the U.S. find themselves hunted by ICE, arbitrarily arrested and thrown into inhumane detention facilities, or sent back to countries of origin where they face persecution, torture or even death.

On Thursday, Nivyabandi repeated Amnesty’s call for the government to stop the passage of Bill C-2 and to withdraw from the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. She also reiterated that Canada must stop using provincial jails and federal prisons for administrative immigration detention.

“Canada cannot continue sending people back to the U.S. to face the cruelty and racism of President Trump’s mass deportation campaign,” Nivyabandi said. “This government must end its complicity in the United States’ attacks on refugees, stop attacking refugee rights here in Canada, and strongly counter false anti-refugee narratives that have crept into the political discourse.”

Upholding international law and the Genocide Convention in Gaza

Since the new session of Parliament opened 100 days ago, Canada has issued gradually escalating condemnations of Israel’s campaign of mass destruction and starvation in Gaza. However, Canada’s words and, crucially, its actions fall short of fulfilling its human rights obligations under international law.

“Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and as a long-time ally of Israel, Canada has an imperative duty to stop it,” Nivyabandi said. “Across the country, Canadians are horrified by the devastation Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza and are desperately calling for the government to act, while Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism rise to alarming levels at home.”

In December 2024, Amnesty International released a landmark report determining that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza — marked by the indiscriminate killing of civilians, the denial of basic supplies such as clean water and electricity, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including health care facilities and schools — met the legal definition of genocide. A growing body of international and Israeli human rights organizations and genocide scholars have since reached the same legal conclusion.

The situation in Gaza has grown more catastrophic since Amnesty International released its genocide report nine months ago. On August 22, five UN agencies announced that more than 500,000 people were trapped in a man-made famine marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths. Evidence gathered by Amnesty International demonstrates how, since the launch of its militarized “aid” distribution system in May, Israel has continued to use starvation of civilians as a weapon of war against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip. On multiple occasions, Israel Defense Forces soldiers have also opened fire on the crowds, killing dozens of people, and creating a booby trap for desperate and already starved Palestinians.

Using the term “genocide,” Nivyabandi noted, does not politicize the crisis; it is a statement of fact. Under international law, a determination of genocide has a strict legal definition and imposes upon states a duty to act. Notably, the Genocide Convention obligates states, including Canada, to prevent genocide — in other words, to act as soon as the risk of genocide has been identified. Failing to do so risks complicity under international law.

“Canada’s halting response to the genocide in Gaza will be scrutinized for decades to come,” Nivyabandi said. “This government must be unequivocal and do what the world failed to undertake in Rwanda 30 years ago: use all means at its disposal and stop a genocide underway.”

Reiterating Amnesty International Canada’s urgent calls to action on Gaza, Nivyabandi demanded that the government, without delay: 1) Sanction Israeli officials suspected of perpetrating the genocide in Gaza and cooperate with the International Criminal Court; 2) ban all arms transfers to Israel; 3) ban all other trade linked to Israel’s genocide, apartheid or illegal occupation against Palestinians; and 4) protect individuals and organizations sanctioned by the U.S. for their advocacy on Palestinian rights.

Asserting Canadian leadership in tumultuous times

The first 100 days of Canada’s new Parliament indicate a decline on human rights, marked by legislative choices and policy inaction that risk turning back the clock for the most vulnerable. However, it is still early enough to change course. This government’s ambition to strengthen Canada’s standing abroad — combined with Canadians’ collective calls to stand firm against Trump’s tariff threats and push toward authoritarianism — provides a sturdy foundation for positive chang“Canada must seize the moment to ensure the next 100 days look profoundly different from the last,” said Nivyabandi. “That means using a human rights approach to public policy, protecting the most vulnerable, and matching words with action. That is the fastest and surest way to a secure future for all.”",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2220434387-scaled-e1757003141683-768x502.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 00:57:02.747626

(WSAV) — WSAV has confirmed with the spokesperson from Homeland Security that Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting a sting operation at the Hyundai plant.

Hundreds of undercover law enforcement vehicles and Humvees were reportedly seen on Kia Road Thursday morning.

Large buses were also seen entering the site. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm (ATF) confirmed Thursday night 450 people were apprehended during the sting operation.

Parts of the Hyundai Megasite were shut down, according to reports.

Workers began sharing video and pictures from inside of the operation after the raid began.

Homeland Investigations (HSI) have not released details on this operation and said the information is sealed under indictment.

WSAV was given the following statement from Mary Beth Kennedy, senior public relations specialist with the HL-GA Battery Company, a Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution company:

“HL-GA Battery Company is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities regarding activity at our construction site. To assist their work, we have paused construction. We do not have further details at this time.”

Thursday afternoon, Yvonne Brooks, president of the Georgia American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) issued this statement in response to the ICE raids at the Hyundai metaplant:

“Georgia’s labor movement is outraged by ICE’s escalating presence at workplaces across the state. This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living. Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers. And when multiple workers have died during the construction of this very plant, the only federal action that could possibly be justified is to strengthen enforcement of occupational safety and health protections and other labor rights—a far cry from ICE raids.

The Georgia AFL-CIO stands with every worker who has been targeted by these politically motivated raids. Our movement will do everything we can to support all working families. That’s what solidarity looks like, and it cannot be broken. Workers in our state will not be pitted against each other.”

The Georgia AFL-CIO is the state’s largest labor federation, representing hundreds of thousands of union members statewide.

Georgia State Patrol (GSP) is reported on the scene.

There are also reports of road closures in the area.

There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describes places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks help from state and local authorities to identify immigrants wanted for deportation and hold them for federal officers.

“The Trump administration’s decision to partner with Louisiana to use the notorious Angola prison to detain immigrants is just the latest move in President Trump’s shameful attack on immigrants.

“Angola prison, a notorious facility built on a former plantation used to enslave people, is steeped in a legacy of racism and brutal conditions. It is appalling that this facility is now being used to detain immigrants, some of whom are seeking safety in the U.S., and others who have lived in the U.S. for years.

“This new partnership follows the dangerous model set by Florida’s Everglades Detention Center, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” Like “Alligator Alcatraz,” the federal use of Angola reflects a disturbing trend of states using public resources to advance President Trump’s inhumane immigration agenda. The very nicknames given to these facilities, “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Louisiana Lockup,” trivialize the suffering of people who are caught up in President Trump’s mass detention and deportation agenda.

“Louisiana is already the second largest state for immigration detention. Thousands of people are already detained in Louisiana in some of the cruelest facilities, with long records of abuse, lack of access to legal counsel, and such a heinous track record of human rights violations the state is referred to as a “black hole” of immigration detention.

“The “Louisiana Lockup” lays bare the racism behind the Trump Administration’s mass detention and deportation machine, being the latest iteration of U.S. policies that prolong and profit off Black, brown, and Indigenous communities. The history of Angola reminds us that the cruelty is the point.

“We must dismantle this racist detention and deportation machine Immigrants are our neighbors, colleagues, family members, and our friends.

Among the issues needing to be sorted out in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was how the ruling in the separate environmental case was going to impact the lawsuit, which claims detainees have been denied the right to meet with their attorneys privately in violation of the First Amendment.

WATCH BELOW: Civil rights case plays out in Fort Myers courtroom

ACLU predicts gov't 'will bring more people' to Alligator Alcatraz

In the environmental lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a preliminary injunction last month ordering operations at the facility to be wound down by the end of October, with detainees transferred to other facilities and equipment and fencing removed.

However, a federal appeals court on Thursday put on hold a lower court judge’s order to wind down operations, saying the faclity can continue to operate while the case plays out.

WPTV chief investigator Jamie Ostroff was inside the Fort Myers courtroom for the separate civil rights case related to ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

The U.S. Attorney's Office said in court that there are between 120 and 125 detainees at the Everglades facility.

The number of detainees has been shrinking from its peak of about 1,000 just before the judge's ruling to dismantle the facility. The state said it was complying with that order, but if the appeals court reversed it, Florida would continue to operate the detention facility.

In this case, attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union say the First Amendment rights of detainees and their immigration lawyers are being violated because they can't meet in a timely and confidential manner.

ACLU lawyer Eunice Cho said Thursday that even though these meetings are taking place more than they were when this lawsuit was filed, the issue remains.

""The government made clear that if the stay was granted by the 11th Circuit, they would continue to reuse the facility, that they were gonna populate it again,"" Cho said. ""I think what we expect is that the government will bring more people to be detained at Alligator Alcatraz, and of course, that raises all of the same questions that we've had throughout this litigation and since this facility was started.""

Emails reveal questions about 'Alligator Alcatraz' reimbursement

The state and federal governments declined to comment on Thursday.

Because the circumstances have changed substantially in this case following the appeals court ruling, the judge asked the ACLU to file a new, amended complaint.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration in late June raced to build the facility on an isolated airstrip surrounded by wetlands to aid President Donald Trump's efforts to deport people in the U.S. illegally. The governor said the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the island prison in California that Republicans named it after.

Thursday's courtroom meeting was also the first hearing since the legal rights case was transferred from Miami to Fort Myers, with one of the counts tossed out. U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz in Miami last month said that the claim that detainees were denied hearings in immigration court was rendered moot when the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for their cases to be heard.

Ruiz also ordered the rest of the case to be heard in Florida's middle district, granting the state defendants a change of venue motion. The remaining counts address allegations of delays in scheduling meetings between detainees and their attorneys and an inability for the detainees to talk privately with their attorneys by phone or videoconference at the facility, whose official name is the South Detention Facility.

Attorneys for the detainees argued in court papers filed Tuesday that the preliminary injunction in the environmental case has no impact on their case since the detention center continues to house detainees.

The state and federal governments have appealed Williams' ruling, asking that it be put on hold. If their request for a stay is denied, and the facility eventually ceases operations, it could render the legal rights lawsuit moot, according to the federal government in court papers.

On the other hand, if the stay is granted and Williams' order is put on hold, the state of Florida plans to resume accepting detainees at the facility, state officials said in court papers for the legal rights case.

'Deportations are continuing' at Alligator Alcatraz, Gov. Ron DeSantis says

As part of their appeal of the environmental case, state officials said that only four U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at any given time are at the Florida-run detention center. The Florida officials said in court papers that the ICE agents ""do not control the site.""

The question of who controls the facility is at the heart of the state and federal government's appeal of Williams' ruling. Her decision was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Miccosukee Tribe, who accused the state and federal defendants of not following federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

The federal government claims that it isn’t responsible for the detention center since it hasn’t spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of it. Florida claims that the environmental impact statement required by federal law doesn't apply to states.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed that an illegal migrant from Pakistan, who served in the U.S. military, has an extensive history of criminal activity paired with ""lies about his military service.""

Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry originally entered the U.S. in 1998 on a B-2 visa after intentionally leaving out criminal history related to convictions in Australia for stealing goods, falsifying passports and committing financial misconduct, according to DHS. DHS told Fox News Digital that Chaudhry also claimed he was deployed to Iraq, though Department of Defense records show he was never actually deployed.

An official with the Department of Defense told Fox News Digital that illegal migrants cannot serve in the military and an individual must have some form of legal status in order to serve. Green card holders (permanent legal residents) are able to join a branch of the U.S. military.

Immigration officials at the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined Chaudhry’s falsified forms and omitting of criminal history were grounds for removal in 2008, but the Pakistani native has been repeatedly appealing the decision for roughly 17 years.

DHS RAGES OVER WHAT IT CALLS A NYT 'SOB STORY' ABOUT CONVICTED JAMAICAN MURDERER DEPORTED BY TRUMP

""Sanctuary politician Bruce Harrell and the media are peddling a FALSE sob story on this serial fraudster,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. ""President Trump and Secretary Noem’s message is clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.""

""Why do sanctuary politicians and the media continue to peddle sob stories of criminal illegals and smear our brave ICE law enforcement officers?"" McLaughlin added. ""Make no mistake, these types of lies are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults.""

According to an Inspector General’s report obtained by Fox News Digital from 2021, Chaudhry collected $449,459.82 in taxpayer dollars from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran’s Benefits Administration (VBA) and currently owes the federal government $81,080 for a mortgage reduction grant from the VBA.

Sources at the Department of Homeland Security told Fox that Chaudhry entered the country on a B-2 tourist visa and then was granted a green card. After officials discovered he previously lied to immigration officials about his criminal past, the green card was revoked — making him an illegal migrant in the U.S.

Chaudhry remains detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being arrested during a citizenship appearance in Tukwila, Washington, on Aug. 21, 2025. He has been placed into removal proceedings after an immigration judge ruled he was in violation of federal immigration law.

Protests in Seattle have since erupted as hundreds of demonstrators stood outside the ICE detention center demanding Chaudhry’s release last week.

Seattle radio host Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital that Democrats have tried to ""portray [Chaudhry] as some sort of victim.""

PILSEN — Organizers of upcoming Mexican Independence Day celebrations are bracing for federal immigration agents to target the festivities.

Gov. JB Pritzker has warned Chicagoans to prepare for an immigration crackdown planned around Mexican Independence Day — which is Sept. 16 — saying federal agents are expected to arrive this week. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to send hundreds of immigration agents here as soon as Friday and has threatened to also send the National Guard.

Some organizers of Mexican Independence Day events said they will not cancel plans, and they will stand united to celebrate the culture, history and heritage of Mexican and Mexican American communities. Others are working with local officials to determine next steps, they said.

Among the celebrations being planned for this month is El Grito Chicago, which is set for Sept. 13-14 in Grant Park. The event will feature live entertainment and music, sports clinics, carnival rides, art workshops and a lineup of food, drinks and vendors.

“In response to recent news, we are working closely with elected officials, community leaders and key stakeholders to determine the best path forward for our annual El Grito celebration,” German Gonzalez, organizer of El Grito Chicago, said in a statement Wednesday.

Last year’s two-day El Grito attracted about 24,000 people and recorded no festival-related incidents, organizers previously said.

“While the targeting of Mexican Independence Day celebrations underscores the vital importance of our mission to uplift our community, it also requires us to carefully consider how we can best serve our community,” Gonzalez said.

In Pilsen, the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade is set to start noon Saturday on West 18th Street. Organizers have been working with the city and police and will have volunteer marshals to serve as “the eyes and ears” throughout the parade to alert participants if the National Guard or immigration agents show up, said Vicky Lugo, whose United Merchants Pilsen Chamber of Commerce organizes the parade.

“People are ready to lift our voices, to celebrate our culture, our heritage and our history,” Lugo said. “We’re not causing any chaos. We’re not causing any problems. It’s a celebration of unity, of our heritage and our culture.”

Pritzker said this week that he’s been notified federal immigration agents will soon be deployed in Chicago, saying his administration believes the timing is tied to the city’s annual Mexican Independence Day festivities. That potentially puts Latino communities at particular risk of being targeted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

“It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful gatherings,” Pritzker said Tuesday.

In Little Village, the 54th annual 26th Street Mexican Independence Day Parade is set for noon-3 p.m. Sept. 14 under the theme “Pride and Power: Our Strength, Our Legacy.” In past years, the parade has drawn hundreds of thousands to Little Village, dubbed by some officials as the Mexican capital of the Midwest.

Organizers said that they are working with elected officials and community organizations to “determine the best next steps that will ensure our community’s safety while honoring our cherished traditions.”

“The Little Village Chamber of Commerce is fully committed to upholding our 54-year tradition of celebrating Mexican Independence Day and supporting our local business community,” Jennifer Aguilar, executive director of the Little Village Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement Wednesday. “We will provide further updates as we work through these considerations with all of the stakeholders involved.”

Earlier this year, organizers of the Little Village Mexican Independence Day Parade said they would not halt plans to celebrate Mexican and Mexican American culture despite fears of immigration raids.

Hosting the parade this year is “almost like an act of resistance” amid the federal administration’s crackdown on immigration and its anti-immigrant rhetoric, Aguilar previously said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services played a key role in the investigation.

According to court documents, the defendants operated a prolific alien smuggling operation that facilitated the unlawful entry of Cuban nationals into the United States by preparing visa applications, laundering millions of dollars in payment, and exploiting the immigration process.

“Through diligent investigation, USCIS and our partners exposed a multi-national, multi-year, multi-million-dollar criminal conspiracy operated by aliens that attempted to undermine our immigration system and flood our country with illegal aliens — none of whom had any intention of following our laws,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This criminal organization operated a front for fake asylum claims, churning out frivolous applications around the country. To criminals who seek to exploit our immigration system: we will find you, shut down your schemes, and you will face justice.”

The superseding indictment charges:

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, 27, of Hialeah, FL (unlawfully residing in the United States);

Yuniel Lima-Santos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, 26, unlawfully residing in Lebanon, TN;

Marianny Lucia Lopez-Torres, 25, residing in Cuba, (formerly Hialeah, FL);

Frandy Aragon-Diaz, 33, of Cuba, (formerly unlawfully residing in Tampa, FL);

Erik Ventura-Castro, 23, residing in Hialeah, FL;

Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Walbis Pozo-Dutel, 30, residing in Katy, TX ;

Emanuel Martinez Gonzalez, 28, unlawfully residing in Hialeah, FL;

Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, 31, of Tampa, FL;

Layra Libertad Treto Santos, 31, of Tampa, FL; and

Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra, 40, of Tampa, FL.

According to the superseding indictment:

All defendants except Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra are charged with conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos and Frandy Aragon-Diaz are also charged with alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Layra Libertad Treto Santos, and Gisleivy Peralta Consuerga are charged with conspiracy to commit asylum fraud.

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Erik Ventura-Castro, Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, and Layra Libertad Treto Santos are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

From January 2021 through June 2025, the defendants promoted bogus visa services online, claiming Cuban nationals could secure U.S. entry through false claims of European citizenship. They filed hundreds of fraudulent Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using fake addresses and fabricated documents.

The alien smuggling operation promoted its services on social media accounts and encrypted messaging platforms, including a WhatsApp group titled, “TRÁMITE DE ESTA Y VISA DE TURISMO A USA PARA CIUDADANOS ESPAÑOLES” (Processing of ESTA and tourist Visas to the USA for Spanish citizens). One promotional video advertised the scheme by showing stacks of passports, airline tickets, and visa approvals.

What began as a small operation grew into a commercial enterprise. The defendants charged clients between $1,500 and $40,000, sometimes even chartering private planes to move groups of aliens. Records show they spent over $2.5 million on flights alone and funneled more than $7 million through payment apps such as Zelle. Based on a financial analysis conducted of 27 known accounts associated with the defendants and their co-conspirators, the alien smuggling organization took in over $18 million during the course of the conspiracy.

The operation also smuggled unaccompanied minors. In one case, a teenage girl was told to pose as the lifelong friend of an unrelated adult man when crossing the border.

The defendants operated a sham immigration business, ASESORIA Y SERVICIOS MIGRATORIOS LLC, which promised asylum filings, work permits, and residency applications. In reality, the company churned out boilerplate asylum claims without clients’ knowledge or consent and even blocked them from accessing their own USCIS online accounts.

ASESORIA marketed itself on Instagram with flashy ads for immigration services while simultaneously posting videos of aliens being smuggled into the country.

The investigation and superseding indictment were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, has been elevated and expanded by the attorney general with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs, among others.

JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

Homeland Security Investigations Tampa, U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector, and USCIS’ Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate led U.S. investigative efforts, with substantial assistance from HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C., and CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force. Authorities in the Cayman Islands provided valuable assistance.

Trial Attorney Jenna Reed of the Criminal Division’s HRSP and Assistant U.S. Attorney Courtney Derry for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations, and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Project Safe Neighborhoods.

An indictment is merely an allegation. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Speaking at a virtual news conference Thursday, Fernández and the attorneys say state officials acknowledged in court last month that municipalities are not obligated under law to sign the so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The city of South Miami had filed a lawsuit against the state to clarify whether the agreements are mandatory for municipalities under Florida law. It is mandatory for counties that run jail systems.

During court testimony last month, attorneys representing the state told the judge municipalities are not required by law to enter into the 287(g) agreement.

The agreement deputizes and trains local law enforcement as ICE agents, and gives them authority to carry out federal immigration laws.

No decision has been made in the ongoing court case, but Fernández told reporters Thursday that he and his attorney “felt validated” by the state’s acknowledgement that it's not mandatory for cities to sign.

“These admissions should provide a clear relief to cities that have not signed an agreement; cities that have been under extreme, unwarranted, and unlawful pressure,” said Alana Greer, Director at the Community Justice Project, during the press conference.

Said Tallahassee City Commissioner Jacqueline ""Jack"" Porter: “Local elected officials are being threatened for even questioning these agreements; we know now that the state itself has admitted that it is not a legal requirement.”

Porter said her city may explore options to withdraw from the agreement with ICE.

Numerous municipalities across the state have joined the partnership under pressure from Gov. Ron DeSantis as the state works closely to help the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts.

South Miami is the only Florida city actively to challenge the state position in court that all cities must enter into immigration enforcement agreements with ICE.

The city is not subject to state law requiring law enforcement agencies partner with ICE because they do not operate a jail. All 67 Florida counties have signed on to partner with ICE because they operate jails.

DeSantis and other top state officials have pushed cities, including Fort Myers and Key West to enter into the agreements by threatening to remove city commissioners from office and cut state funding.

Law enforcement agencies, like Tallahassee Police Department, that have active 287(g) agreements, must get approval from the State Board of Immigration Enforcement to terminate their agreements.

As the prisoners’ lawsuit lays out, all ten of the litigants were sentenced under the old law and knew they would be executed by lethal injection from the moment they were sentenced.
The power to designate the execution method used in Arkansas is, they say, a legislative power.
It asks the court to recognize that a state’s choice of an execution method is by no means merely a technical one.
And the Arkansas litigation is not the usual method of execution challenge since it does not question the constitutionality of either of the methods mentioned in Act 302.","Challenges to particular methods of execution have become a standard part of the litigation strategy in many death penalty cases, even though, in recent years, the Supreme Court has made them much more difficult to win. But for any of those challenges to occur, death row inmates have to know which method a state intends to use to put them to death.

That is why states like Arkansas and Florida have revised the laws governing execution to grant unchecked discretion to the people in charge of carrying out executions to choose the method. They make it hard for death row inmates to know, in a timely manner, the method that will be employed in their cases.

This mystery not only complicates litigation strategies, but it adds a layer of cruelty to the heavy psychological toll already associated with the death penalty process. And it runs afoul of Supreme Court rulings about the things legislative bodies can and cannot delegate to executive agencies, like the departments of corrections that are responsible for putting the condemned to death.

Whether courts will recognize that problem in the context of capital punishment remains to be seen. But a suit filed last month in Arkansas will test their willingness to do so.

This first-of-its-kind suit was filed on August 5 in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County on behalf of ten of the twenty-three inmates currently on Arkansas’s death row. It alleges that legislation enacted earlier this year, Act 302, which does not specify whether they will be executed by lethal injection or nitrogen hypoxia, is unconstitutional because it violates the state constitution’s separation of powers.

Act 302 changed the existing law, which read “A person convicted of a capital offense shall be punished by death by lethal injection or by life imprisonment without parole….” The new law deletes the reference to lethal injection as a necessary part of the punishment of death.

It now says, “A person convicted of a capital offense shall be punished by death or by life imprisonment without parole….”

Act 302 allows the Division of Corrections to “carry out the sentence of death either by intravenous lethal injection of…[a] drug or drugs…in an amount sufficient to cause death or by nitrogen gas.” That’s it.

The law offers no guidance as to the factors that the DOC must consider or the standards that should govern its choice. There is nothing to prevent it from choosing one or another method because correctional officials dislike a prisoner or want to pay back those who have been troublesome while on death row.

And there is nothing in the new law to prevent them from choosing an execution method because of the race of the inmate or of their victim, factors that we already know play a role in death sentencing and decisions to seek death warrants. If Arkansas’s new law survives judicial scrutiny, race may play a role in determining whether an inmate is put to death by lethal injection or nitrogen hypoxia.

What a nightmarish possibility.

As the prisoners’ lawsuit lays out, all ten of the litigants were sentenced under the old law and knew they would be executed by lethal injection from the moment they were sentenced. No more.

The power to designate the execution method used in Arkansas is, they say, a legislative power. They argue that the legislature cannot “delegate to the Department of Corrections and ADC Director absolute, unfettered discretion to choose between lethal injection and nitrogen hypoxia as the means for executing [them].”

And while Act 302 gives detailed instructions about lethal injection procedures, it “provides no standards to the Department of Corrections and ADC Director to constrain and guide the use of nitrogen hypoxia…”

Standardless delegations of authority by legislative bodies to executive agencies, of the kind contained in Act 302, have drawn the ire of the current majority on the United States Supreme Court. As the Court explained last June, “To distinguish between the permissible and the impermissible…[delegation of authority], this Court asks whether Congress has set out an ‘intelligible principle’ to guide what it has given the agency to do.”

“Under that test,” the Court said, “Congress must make clear both ‘the general policy’ the agency must pursue and ‘the boundaries of [its] delegated authority.’”

Justice Neil Gorsuch put it simply, “the Constitution…command[s] that Congress ‘may not transfer to another branch ‘powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.’”

The Arkansas suit is premised on exactly that understanding.

It asks the court to recognize that a state’s choice of an execution method is by no means merely a technical one. It is instead a profound political and moral one, appropriately left to the people and their elected representatives and subject to the constitutional requirement that the method not be cruel or unusual.

The lawsuit’s critique of the delegation of that choice contained in Act 302 seems to align perfectly with Gorsuch’s understanding, though there is some irony in seeing the doctrine developed by a death penalty enthusiast like him, now applied in an effort to invalidate a statute enacted to make executions easier.

The Arkansas lawsuit also says that Act 302 “impairs the judicial function by imposing and modifying prior sentences” and that a new punishment like nitrogen hypoxia for capital murder cannot be inflicted retroactively “without violating the Arkansas Constitution’s due process protections and prohibitions on bills of attainder.”

In the end, Arkansas is a somewhat unexpected place for such a consequential death penalty lawsuit to occur. It has not carried out an execution since 2017, and not seen a new death sentence since 2018.

And the Arkansas litigation is not the usual method of execution challenge since it does not question the constitutionality of either of the methods mentioned in Act 302. It just insists that people sentenced to death can’t be left in the dark, until the last minute, about which method will be chosen to kill them.

The fate of the litigation filed this month in the self-proclaimed “Natural State” may go a long way in determining whether other more active death penalty states can keep not only the condemned, but the people as well from knowing in advance how executions will be carried out in their name.",https://i0.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/shutterstock_156003992.jpeg?quality=90&resize=426%2C350&strip=all&fit=1000%25&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-04 19:57:33.066027

In a petition filed late on Wednesday, the administration asked the justices to quickly intervene to rule that the president has the power to impose such import taxes on foreign nations.

A divided US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit last week ruled 7-4 that the tariffs Trump brought in through an emergency economic powers act did not fall within the president's mandate and that setting levies was ""a core Congressional power"".

The case could upend Trump's economic and foreign policy agenda and force the US to refund billions in tariffs.

Trump had justified the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the president the power to act against ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats.

In April, Trump declared an economic emergency, arguing that a trade imbalance had undermined domestic manufacturing and was harmful to national security.

While the appellate court ruled against the president, it postponed its decision from taking effect, allowing the Trump administration time to file an appeal.

""The stakes in this case could not be higher,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said in Wednesday night's filing.

He wrote that the lower court's ""erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign policy crisis"".

Lawyers representing small businesses challenging the tariffs said they were confident they would win the case.

""These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardising their survival,"" said Jeffrey Schwab of Liberty Justice Center. ""We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients.""

If the Supreme Court justices deny the review, the ruling could take effect on 14 October.

What tariffs has Trump announced and why?

How much cash is the US raising from tariffs?

In May, the New York-based Court of International Trade declared the tariffs were unlawful. That decision was also put on hold during the appeal process.

The rulings came in response to lawsuits filed by small businesses and a coalition of US states opposing the tariffs.

In April, Trump signed executive orders imposing a baseline 10% tariff as well as ""reciprocal"" tariffs intended to correct trade imbalances on more than 90 countries.

In addition to those tariffs, the appellate court ruling also strikes down levies on Canada, Mexico and China, which Trump argues are necessary to stop the importation of drugs.

The decision does not apply to some other US duties, like those imposed on steel and aluminium, which were brought in under a different presidential authority.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ff7e/live/a309f100-891d-11f0-b663-f3bb91f7a7fe.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 21:57:39.964139

Green",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/04/us/trump-news,"So far, the Trump administration has filed about 20 emergency applications, many of which seek to remove blocks imposed by district-court judges.
Between 120 and 125 detainees remain, a lawyer for the federal government said on Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Fort Myers.
Mr. Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying the military is needed there to fight crime.
Mr. Trump is already embroiled in a legal battle with Lisa Cook, a governor he is trying to oust over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.
Mr. Miran has been a vocal cheerleader of the president’s economic policies and is expected to press for what Mr. Trump wants at the Fed.","“It’s a difficult job that each of us has,” he said, as he opened remarks during a luncheon panel at the annual Sixth Circuit Judicial Conference in Memphis, “particularly the trial judges who operate alone.” (In the federal system, district courts are the trial courts.)

He called trial-court judges “the front lines of American justice” and thanked them for helping to “preserve and protect the Constitution and the rule of law of the United States.”

Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came at a time of increased strain on the Supreme Court’s relationship with district court judges, who have often moved swiftly to block President Trump’s policies with sweeping preliminary orders, issued before a case has been heard in full. The Supreme Court in turn in June imposed new limits on the lower courts’ power to issue orders that affect the whole country, known as universal injunctions.

The justices have also intervened in more than a dozen individual cases in ways that at least temporarily lift blocks imposed by lower court judges that would have stopped Mr. Trump’s policies from being implemented while their legality is litigated.

Justice Kavanaugh, whose mother is a retired state-court judge, told the judges gathered in Memphis that she had often impressed on him how difficult the job of a trial-court judge could be.

“It’s kind of like having the referee on the field, and then we’re sitting up in the replay booth, dissecting every frame of the replay,” he said. “Respect for the role of the trial judge as a single person who has to make quick decisions is something that I saw firsthand,” he added.

In the case on universal injunctions, Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the new limitations on district-court judges’ powers “will help bring substantially more order and discipline” to lawsuits over executive orders.

In a case late last month, he joined Justice Neil M. Gorsuch in rebuking judges who “defy” the Supreme Court by failing to apply its emergency orders, which, Justice Gorsuch wrote, “carry precedential weight.” That criticism, issued in a case dealing with cuts to National Institutes of Health grant funding, prompted a pointed apology from the bench by Judge William G. Young of Massachusetts, the Reagan-appointed judge at whom it was directed.

The increasing number of emergency orders issued by the Supreme Court have come in response to a flurry of executive orders issued by the Trump administration, which have then been challenged in court. The administration has sought the intervention of the Supreme Court in a series of cases, asking the justices to remove temporary blocks imposed by lower-court judges.

Critics call this growing segment of the Supreme Court’s caseload the “emergency docket” or “shadow docket,” because it involves less briefing, usually no oral arguments and generally less deliberation by the justices. On Thursday, Justice Kavanaugh said that “interim docket” was a more accurate term, as not all of the matters under review were actual emergencies, nor were the court’s orders necessarily its final word on the issues.

The interim docket’s rise, Justice Kavanaugh argued, has been driven by factors outside the Supreme Court’s control. In what he called “structural separation of powers,” presidents seek to advance their agenda despite inaction by Congress. That dynamic, he said, is “totally bipartisan,” predating Mr. Trump’s presidency.

So far, the Trump administration has filed about 20 emergency applications, many of which seek to remove blocks imposed by district-court judges. That total over the last seven and a half months exceeds the number of applications filed by President Joseph R. Biden’s administration during his four-year term.

Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came in response to questions from Judge Joan L. Larsen and Judge Andre B. Mathis, who both sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

While he was careful to present the executive branch’s current relationship with the courts as more of a continuation than a rupture, Justice Kavanaugh appeared to acknowledge that the degree of political rancor in the Trump era was unusual. He suggested that judges, especially when writing dissents, should do what they could to lower the temperature.

“We’re modeling behavior for everyone,” he said, adding that that made civility and neutrality especially important “when the tone around us, in the public sphere, in the political world, on all sides, is loud.”

The latest ruling was a victory for Florida, which pushed the boundaries of traditional immigration enforcement when it opened the facility in July. It became the first state to run an immigrant detention center — normally a federal role. Other states have since announced plans to house federal immigration detainees in state-owned facilities.

The ruling was also significant for the Department of Homeland Security, which had argued in court that it was not running the Everglades detention center.

In granting the stay, the appeals panel found that the lower court had misinterpreted a federal law requiring a review of potential environmental harms before building a major project in the ecologically fragile Everglades. It found that because the detention center had so far been entirely funded by Florida, and because the state operated the center, the National Environmental Policy Act would not apply.

Florida has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the detention center, an outlay that Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has repeatedly said will be reimbursed by the federal government. Even if that should happen, the appeals panel ruled, it would be “insufficient” grounds to consider the detention center a major federal project subject to environmental review.

“Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we’ve always said, open for business,” Mr. DeSantis said in a video posted to X shortly after the appellate ruling. “The mission continues, and we’re going to continue leading the way when it comes to immigration enforcement.”

Elise Bennett, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said that environmental groups hoped to “ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility.”

“This is a heartbreaking blow to America’s Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn’t even close to over,” Ms. Bennett, the center’s Florida and Caribbean director, said in a statement.

Mr. DeSantis, whose administration has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, recently announced plans to open a second detention center at an empty state prison west of Jacksonville. This week, he also floated the idea of opening a third such center, in the Florida Panhandle.

Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the Federal District Court in Miami ruled on Aug. 21 in favor of environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, which had sought to halt construction on the center and its operations because of the lack of environmental review. Since then, the number of immigrant detainees at the facility has dwindled.

Between 120 and 125 detainees remain, a lawyer for the federal government said on Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Fort Myers. The hearing was on a different case regarding the Everglades detention center.

During that hearing, Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, told Judge Sheri Polster Chappell that Florida was not bringing any additional detainees to the Everglades detention center, but intended to keep it running, and to bring in more detainees, if Judge Williams’s ruling were reversed.

The appeals panel found that the state and federal governments would suffer “irreparable harm” if the Everglades detention center were shut down while the case played out in court.

“Florida will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot ‘apply its own laws’ to respond to an immigration crisis and serve the public interest,” Judge Barbara Lagoa wrote in the 2-to-1 ruling. She was joined by Judge Elizabeth L. Branch. Both were appointed by President Trump.

Among the reasons the appeals panel cited for allowing the detention center to remain open was that the state said it would cost $15 million to $20 million to dismantle much of the facility — and then the same amount to rebuild if it were to succeed in its appeal.

In his dissent, Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote that the appeals panel had overstepped its limited role in ruling for the state and federal governments and dismissing the lower court’s findings that the sensitive Everglades ecosystem could be harmed.

“The district court properly balanced the equities and the public interest,” Judge Jordan wrote. “The court considered the significant ongoing and likely future environmental harms to the plaintiffs from the detention facility, as well as the importance of immigration enforcement to the state and federal defendants.”

But with Republicans pushing for deep cuts and Democrats resisting, a broad spending agreement will be exceedingly difficult. And even a short-term measure is likely to be challenging, with the two parties divided over key details. Such a package would also pose a political challenge for Democrats, who weathered a backlash from their voters in March when they allowed the current stopgap spending bill to move forward.

“We don’t want a shutdown,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader. “We want bipartisan negotiations and a bipartisan bill. If Republicans want to keep the government open, they’ve got to work with us.”

Back in March, Democrats agonized for days over whether to supply the votes needed to allow the G.O.P.-written temporary spending measure to move ahead. Mr. Schumer and nine other members of his caucus ultimately voted to let it advance, arguing that a shutdown would only empower Mr. Trump to tighten his grip on federal agencies and to unilaterally decide what money to spend.

Democrats have said they would find it extremely difficult to back future funding measures without some kind of assurance that Republicans would not continue to allow the Trump administration to cancel spending after Congress approves it. In order to clear a Senate filibuster, government spending deals have historically been bipartisan products.

Instead, the Trump administration last month advanced a new effort to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion that lawmakers approved for foreign aid programs, infuriating Democrats.

“It almost seems like they want a fight,” Senator John Hickenlooper, Democrat of Colorado, said of the gambit, known as a pocket rescission.

At the same time, Republicans appear poised to change the rules of the Senate to fast-track the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s nominees, an attempt to overcome Democratic insistence on holding formal roll call votes on every executive branch nominee.

The Republican efforts have riled Democrats, who for months have seethed at the president’s escalating campaign to undercut congressional spending authority.

“I’m not going to go along with keeping the government open unless they change course,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told NPR.

“Trump has made it clear that the budget is not worth the paper it’s written on,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut. “There can’t be any good-faith negotiation when the implementer of the budget is refusing to implement it.”

For now, Democratic leaders have said they are willing to vote for a spending package, as long as they get a say in the contents.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she would support negotiating bipartisan versions of three of the least divisive spending bills the Senate and the House have already separately approved, then passing them with a stopgap bill.

Any short-term spending agreement “needs to reflect Democratic values and principles, and needs to be a real bipartisan compromise,” Ms. Murray said.

Efforts to find a compromise on spending levels could be difficult. House Republicans have largely rejected the deepest spending cuts proposed by the White House, but they are advancing funding bills setting drastically lower spending levels than their counterparts in the Senate. Their bills would slash spending across the board, including an 11 percent cut to the bill that funds the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.

“Following the president’s clear direction, we have taken a critical look at every program, and in several cases had to make hard decisions on some ‘nice-to-have’ programs,” said Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama, who leads the spending subcommittee in charge of labor and health. “Americans must prioritize resources at the kitchen table, and we should be doing the same here in Congress.”

The question of how long a stopgap bill would last could also divide Republicans. More conservative House Republicans have long chafed at yearlong temporary bills because the bills traditionally keep spending flat and do not make cuts.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican majority leader, said lawmakers would “inevitably” need a stopgap measure “for some time.”

He added: “What that looks like and how long that might extend, I think, probably, is a matter of discussion.”

Some Democrats have privately said that they are negotiating against a backdrop that is more politically favorable to them than the one they encountered in March, an argument that Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made publicly this week.

“One thing that’s different from back then: Donald Trump at the beginning of this year was 9 points up,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “He’s 9 points under.”

That has created a political environment, she said, that has allowed Mr. Schumer and Democrats to recruit strong candidates to run for the Senate in next year’s crucial midterm elections, she said.

“It is a very different situation,” she continued, “and they know it.”

It is not clear which U.S. attorney’s offices are involved in the inquiry, but Ms. Cook previously reported in disclosures that she had owned homes in Georgia, Massachusetts and Michigan, according to court records. Federal prosecutors have begun issuing subpoenas, one of the people briefed in the investigation said.

The opening of the investigation, earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as little surprise. Mr. Martin, who leads the department’s vaguely defined weaponization task force after Senate Republicans scuttled his nomination to be the permanent U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, signaled his intention to do so as the White House stepped up its attacks on Ms. Cook.

The saga began when Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office had investigated Ms. Cook and found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage. Mr. Pulte later referred the matter to the Justice Department for a criminal inquiry, before Mr. Trump announced he would fire Ms. Cook from the Fed.

Ms. Cook initially responded in a statement that she would not be “bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” But she said she would take “questions about my financial history seriously” and gather the facts. She then sued the administration over its attempted firing, and in a hearing last week, her lawyers depicted her potential ouster as an illegal bid to undermine the traditional independence of the Federal Reserve.

In a statement Thursday, Abbe D. Lowell, the lawyer representing Ms. Cook, said the reports suggested the Trump administration was “scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach,” describing the Justice Department as “perhaps the most politicized” in American history.

“The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this D.O.J. to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again,” Mr. Lowell continued.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Martin, who has been given few staff but broad latitude to team up with U.S. attorney’s offices around the country, flouted the department’s procedural norms last month by suggesting to the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, that Ms. Cook step aside.

Ms. Cook’s case “requires further examination” Mr. Martin wrote in a letter to Mr. Powell, suggesting that the department could be pursuing an investigation.

“At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms. Cook from your board,” Mr. Martin wrote. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”

The administration, led by Mr. Pulte, has increasingly scrutinized the mortgage applications of Mr. Trump’s political adversaries to seek retribution against his enemies. The Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has acted on referrals from other government agencies by proceeding with mortgage fraud investigations of the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, and Senator Adam B. Schiff, two prominent Democrats who are known as critics of Mr. Trump.

On Thursday, Revolution Wind LLC, a joint venture between Orsted and Skyborn Renewables, asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the administration from enforcing the stop-work order. The complaint alleges that the order was arbitrary and capricious in part because it appeared to be carried out under political pressure from the White House.

The attorneys general of Connecticut and Rhode Island also said that they would file a separate lawsuit Thursday in the United States District Court for Rhode Island to overturn the stop-work order.

The 65-turbine Revolution Wind project had obtained financing as well as all necessary permits from the Biden administration. Construction began in 2023, and the developers had said it was on track to produce enough electricity for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

In their complaint, the developers said that they had already spent $5 billion on the project and would incur another $1 billion in financial penalties from failing to complete it, while also losing billions of dollars in future revenue if the project was canceled.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, the parent agency of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said it did not comment on pending litigation.

President Trump has been a vocal critic of wind firms for years, calling them ugly and inefficient. His administration has sharply escalated its attacks on the wind industry in recent months, moving to block not just future wind projects but also projects that have already been permitted and under construction.

The White House has also enlisted a half-dozen federal agencies to find new ways to thwart offshore wind as part of a governmentwide effort to suppress the industry. That includes asking the Health and Human Services Department to probe the health effects of wind turbines and the Department of Defense to find any national security concerns.

“President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman.

In April, the Interior Department ordered that work be stopped at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of New York that had received all necessary approvals from the Biden administration and was already being built. After several weeks of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration allowed Empire Wind to proceed.

White House officials suggested they had done so only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. She denied that any such deal had been made.

Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant that was building Empire Wind, never ended up suing the administration over the monthlong pause. The company had warned that it was losing nearly $50 million per week while the project was halted and that it might have to abandon it altogether if the stop-work order continued for much longer.

Orsted is taking legal action more rapidly. The Danish government owns a 50.1 percent share in the company, which saw its stock price plunge to record lows last month after the stop-work order.

Denmark and the United States have repeatedly been at odds under the Trump administration, with Denmark rejecting Mr. Trump’s insistence that the United States take over Greenland. Last month, Denmark summoned the head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen after allegations that three Americans with ties to President Trump were running “covert influence operations” in Greenland.

In a statement, the developers behind Revolution Wind said that “the project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step.”

Gov. Ned Lamont, Democrat of Connecticut, said he was willing to work with the administration but it had not justified its decision to halt construction and that the state was acting “to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region.”

Before it obtained federal permits, Revolution Wind went through a multiyear review process that included the Defense Department, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service and several other agencies.

Some legal experts have said that there is little basis for blocking projects that have already received permits.

Elizabeth Klein, who led the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management during the Biden administration, said the agency did have the ability to halt projects for national security reasons. But even in those cases, the agency is required to follow a process that includes a written notification describing the basis of its concerns. And the regulator would typically discuss issues with the developer rather than abruptly stop work without warning.

“Even under the most generous interpretation of what is happening here, if there were some issue that arose that suggested a threat, there would be a dialogue between the regulator and the proponent,” Ms. Klein said. “There’s no actual justification to stop the project.”

The administration is also pursuing other strategies for blocking offshore wind. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump ordered a sweeping halt to all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms. And it has sought to revoke permits for projects that have already been approved but are facing litigation by opponents.

On Wednesday the Trump administration said in another court filing that it planned to revoke federal approvals for the New England Wind project, about 20 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. Construction has not yet begun, but if completed it would be one of the largest offshore wind projects in the country.

A group in Nantucket that is opposed to offshore wind, ACK for Whales, had filed a lawsuit to challenge New England Wind’s permits, saying that the project posed a danger to the endangered North Atlantic right whale. Scientists have said there is no evidence to link wind farms to whale deaths. In a filing, the Justice Department said that the lawsuit no longer needed to proceed since the administration was rescinding the project’s permit.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have sued the administration over Mr. Trump’s halting of federal approvals for wind projects.

The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts federal court, argued that the move violated the Administrative Procedure Act and harmed the efforts by states to secure energy and fight climate change while jeopardizing billions of dollars in investments. The Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a coalition of environmental and clean energy industry groups, later joined the suit as a plaintiff.

Administration lawyers countered that the injuries to New York were hypothetical rather than imminent and that the pause in federal permitting was necessary “based on concerns over potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews,” according to a memo signed by Michael K. Robertson, a trial attorney in the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department.

In July, Judge William G. Young narrowed the case but allowed it to proceed. A hearing was set to be held on Thursday afternoon.

Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.

The expenses, Mr. Newsom said, included $71 million for food and shelter, $37 million in payroll, more than $4 million in logistics supplies, $3.5 million in travel and $1.5 million for demobilization.

The Pentagon initially estimated that the activation would cost $134 million and last about 60 days. As of Thursday, the deployment has lasted 89 days, with about 300 troops remaining on orders that have been extended into November. Because the troops were commandeered by the White House, the deployment costs are a federal obligation.

In a statement, Mr. Newsom condemned the Los Angeles deployment as “political theater” that has sent “millions of taxpayer dollars down the drain” and corroded the readiness of the National Guard.

Mr. Newsom’s public-records request to military officials last month called on them to tell American taxpayers “how much this folly has cost them.” His office still has not formally received a response from the Defense Department to that request. The governor also requested cost calculations from the California National Guard, which supplied his office with the data.

The nearly $120 million figure is consistent with standard pay and support costs for the Marines and the National Guard. The total cost matched data supplied to the federal government, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the deployment costs with the press.

At the height of the deployment, thousands of National Guard soldiers were being housed in a sprawling and hastily erected tent city south of Los Angeles at a military facility near Long Beach. Only a few hundred troops were assigned any duties away from the base. Many of those who were given outside assignments — largely to assist federal agents arresting undocumented immigrants in workplaces — were used illegally, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.

Federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and military officials who testified in court described an ongoing struggle to ensure that troops were not used by federal agents in ways that violated their authority or endangered the public. In interviews with The New York Times, several members of the National Guard, including infantrymen and two officials in leadership roles, spoke of low morale during the deployment. They described troops who were demoralized, bored and questioning the mission. On the upside, they said, the federal activation meant better benefits and higher pay.

Most of the troops have since been released, with the remainder scattered across several federal facilities in Southern California. The Trump administration extended their activation last month, saying the troops are needed to protect federal buildings and personnel.

This week, Mr. Newsom asked the federal court to order their removal, saying that the extension amounted to an “intimidation” tactic in advance of a November special election on redistricting that could impact control of Congress in 2026.

Mr. Newsom’s announcement of the deployment costs came as other Democratic-led cities across the United States have braced for the presence of federal troops.

Mr. Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying the military is needed there to fight crime. And he has suggested that the National Guard could be sent into Chicago, New Orleans and other cities.

The intervention, which President Trump has said is a response to a “public safety emergency,” has prompted criticism and protests from many people in the city who say the president wants to use his power over the federal enclave to roll back the city’s limited self-governance and punish it for policies he objects to.

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Brian Schwalb, D.C.’s elected attorney general, who brought the suit, said in a statement. “We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

In the suit, Mr. Schwalb asks the court to declare that the orders sending the National Guard troops to Washington were illegal.

The lawsuit comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June was illegal.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.”

Even as the Guard deployments have faced local pushback and legal challenges, Mr. Trump has been promising to send troops to other cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Like Washington and Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago are led by mayors who are Black and are Democrats.

Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.

But the suit argues that the deployment of the local guard for public safety reasons, and without the mayor’s consent, violated Washington’s autonomy under the 52-year-old Home Rule Act.

The key argument in the suit is similar to the one the judge in California based his ruling on: that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city runs “roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy — that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

Mr. Trump had made clear that such a role was his intention, saying on Aug. 11 that he was calling out the Guard to “reestablish law, order and public safety” in the city. Since then, even as federal law enforcement officers have been involved in hundreds of arrests and immigration agents have been detaining hundreds of Washington residents deemed to be in the country illegally, the National Guard troops have been patrolling Metro stations and around city landmarks. Some have been picking up trash.

Many if not most of the National Guard soldiers have been deputized as U.S. Marshals. That gives the soldiers the power to detain people, the lawsuit asserts, establishing “a massive, seemingly indefinite law enforcement operation in the District subject to direct military command.”

The suit is the second the attorney general has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.

The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police. The judge’s comments during the initial court hearing suggested the city was likely to prevail, but after several hours of negotiation, the U.S. Attorney General agreed to take a more limited role in compelling local police to cooperate on certain tasks.

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington was an outspoken supporter of that earlier lawsuit. While the mayor has expressed a willingness to work with federal law enforcement agents in addressing violent crime, she has criticized the presence of out-of-state National Guard troops in the city, saying they are not helping.

Still, the mayor deferred questions about Thursday’s lawsuit to Mr. Schwalb’s office. “My 100 percent focus is on exiting the emergency, and that’s where all of our energies are,” Ms. Bowser said to reporters at a school-related event.

The emergency that Mr. Trump declared in early August ends next week if Congress does not vote to extend it, and any authority that the Trump administration holds to direct local police actions expires with it.

But much of the federal intervention in D.C. in recent weeks, including the presence of National Guard troops, is not subject to the emergency declaration. Barring a judicial ruling, many of the soldiers and federal law enforcement agents now on the ground could remain indefinitely.

Republicans in Congress have applauded the intervention, and many are pushing to bring an even heavier federal hand onto Washington’s affairs.

The House Oversight Committee, whose jurisdiction includes D.C., is expected next week to take up a bill that would toughen the District’s crime laws with regard to juvenile offenders. It is also weighing a slate of bills to reshape Washington’s criminal justice system by adding tougher penalties for some offenses and rolling back sentencing reforms passed by local lawmakers, according to a draft summary that was shared with congressional offices and viewed by The New York Times.

Among the bills being considered are legislation that would lengthen or establish mandatory minimum sentences for many crimes and repeal second-chance legislation meant to allow some people to have their criminal records sealed or expunged. Another measure under discussion would impose a $500 fine or a prison sentence of up to 30 days on people who camp outdoors on public property in the District, a measure that appears designed to target homeless encampments that Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited in justifying his efforts in Washington. The legislation was reported earlier by The Washington Post.

There is also a measure that would significantly increase congressional oversight of D.C.’s elected government, giving federal lawmakers the authority to veto local regulations and mayoral executive actions, as well as broadening the veto power Congress already has regarding laws passed by the D.C. Council. That piece of legislation, which expands on a similar bill proposed last year, is tentatively called “The District of Columbia Home Rule Improvement Act.”

Rather than resign from his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Miran told lawmakers on the powerful Senate Banking Committee that he would take an unpaid leave of absence to fill a term on the Fed’s Board of Governors that is set to expire at the end of January. He cited the short tenure of the position and said the decision reflected the advice of counsel.

Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, called the arrangement “ridiculous.”

“Your independence has already been seriously compromised by your statement,” he added.

Senator Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, suggested that the decision made it very likely that Mr. Miran would continue to be beholden to the president while serving at the central bank.

“You could very well be continuing to act in a way that is in the political interests of the president, because you know he is going to be your future boss again at the White House,” Mr. Kim said. “Why do you even want this job at the Fed for four months, if you’re just hedging your bets and just continuing to hold your position at the White House?”

The law stipulates that members of the Fed’s board “shall devote their entire time to the business of the board.”

The issue dominated a hearing that gave Republicans and Democrats their best opportunity yet to dig into the Trump administration’s plans to overhaul the central bank amid a relentless pressure campaign from the president, who wants the Fed to slash interest rates.

Mr. Miran’s hearing was hastily scheduled so that he could possibly be in place before the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17. He was selected to fill the temporary position in August, after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from her post five months before her term ended.

Mr. Miran sought to head off questions about his ability to make policy decisions free of political influence from the start of the hearing. In opening remarks, he said the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on major policy decisions, was an “independent group with a monumental task, and I intend to preserve that independence and serve the American people to the best of my ability.”

As the hearing got underway, he repeatedly pushed back on the idea that he would function as a “puppet” of Mr. Trump’s, as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused him of being on Thursday.

“No one — not the American public, not investors here at home, not the worldwide financial markets — will trust him as an independent voice,” she said. “Every claim he makes and every vote he takes will be tainted with the suspicion that he isn’t an honest broker, but that he is Donald Trump’s puppet.”

Mr. Miran said he had not been asked to make any pledge to lower interest rates and said his views would be determined by the economic data and his own analysis.

While Republicans appeared ready to confirm Mr. Miran, his assurances rang hollow for many Democrats on the committee, given the extent of the attacks being waged on the Fed.

Mr. Trump is already embroiled in a legal battle with Lisa Cook, a governor he is trying to oust over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Ms. Cook, who has not been charged or convicted of any wrongdoing, has sued to prevent her removal, teeing up what is expected to be a prolonged fight over the president’s ability to remove a Fed official “for cause.” That is typically interpreted to mean professional neglect or wrongdoing.

“Your nomination is getting rushed because the president is frustrated with the Fed for not cutting rates, and he wants loyalists on the Fed board,” said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota.

Mr. Miran did not talk about Ms. Cook’s case directly, but he did clarify when asked that he had not made false statements on any mortgage applications.

If Ms. Cook loses her case, Mr. Trump will have yet another opening on the Fed’s board to fill, tipping the balance of support further in his favor. The president will also get to nominate a new chair once the term of the current head of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, ends in May.

If Mr. Trump has a majority of governors in his corner, he is likely to command greater sway over an institution that is supposed to operate independently from the White House.

As a governor, Mr. Miran would be able to vote on every major policy decision the Fed makes, including on interest rates and the rules that govern Wall Street. He would also be involved in deliberations related to the inner workings of the Fed and its staff.

Lawmakers repeatedly brought up a paper that Mr. Miran co-wrote in 2024. The paper sharply criticized the central bank and concluded that its institutional setup made it prone to policy errors and that it was unaccountable to the very people it was supposed to serve. The paper also included a series of profound reforms for the central bank. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Miran called for an end to the “revolving door between the executive branch and the Fed” — the exact journey that he now finds himself taking.

As part of a radical reset, he called for shorter terms for top officials and the ability for the president to remove policymakers for any reason. Mr. Miran wanted the 12 regional reserve bank presidents to have more say in interest rate decisions, but to come under the control of state governors. He also sought to subject the central bank’s budget to the congressional appropriations process rather than maintaining the Fed’s autonomy.

Before joining the administration, he also floated the idea of weakening the value of the U.S. dollar in a bid to make American exports more competitive, a proposal known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord. He also highlighted the costs of the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, a position that stands in sharp contrast to how the Fed sees it.

The Fed, which is overseen by Congress, is obligated to set monetary policy in pursuit of low and stable inflation as well as a healthy labor market. The central bank’s longstanding inflation target is 2 percent, a level it has exceeded since consumer price growth accelerated in the pandemic.

Before Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on effectively all of the country’s major trading partners, inflation was easing. But price pressures have intensified again, leaving a divided Fed in a difficult spot in terms of what to do about interest rates. The labor market, meanwhile, has started to show more obvious signs of softening.

Officials are getting ready to restart cuts that were put on pause in January in recognition that the risks posed to the labor market are outweighing the risk of a persistent inflation problem. But policymakers are likely to move slowly once they get going again, keeping them at odds with the president’s demands for borrowing costs that are three percentage points lower than the current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent.

Mr. Miran has been a vocal cheerleader of the president’s economic policies and is expected to press for what Mr. Trump wants at the Fed. But he would also have to be careful about alienating himself from his soon-to-be colleagues. Decisions related to interest rates and the balance sheet, for example, are made by a 12-person committee of the governors and a rotation of five regional Fed presidents.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to decide by Sept. 10 whether to review the case and to schedule oral argument for the first week of November — just one month after the court’s new term begins. If the justices accept the case, it would be the first to reach the court in Mr. Trump’s second term that directly tests the legality of one of the administration’s signature initiatives rather than addressing the president’s actions on a temporary emergency basis.

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 as a central part of his efforts to force companies to invest in the United States.

Without the emergency powers, the president and his advisers have warned of major damage to the nation’s economy, military power and diplomatic relations, particularly if the government were forced to pay back some of the billions of dollars it has already collected in tariffs.

The lower court’s “erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the president’s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,” the solicitor general told the justices in his request for highly expedited review. The petition had not yet been publicly docketed on the court’s website late Wednesday, but its filing was confirmed by both sides in the litigation.

Other presidents have invoked the emergency statute, typically to issue sanctions, but Mr. Trump is the first to try to use the emergency powers to impose broad levies of 10 to 50 percent on trading partners.

In April, five small businesses and a dozen states sued, saying Mr. Trump’s actions were unlawful.

Lawyers for the coalition expressed confidence in their legal arguments late Wednesday.

“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement.

A divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last week upheld a lower court decision invalidating the tariffs and finding the president’s actions were not authorized by the emergency statute.

In its 7-to-4 ruling, the appeals court said the tariffs were a core constitutional power given to Congress and noted that the statute at issue did not include the word “tariffs” nor synonyms such as “tax” or “duty.”

“The power of the purse (including the power to tax) belongs to Congress,” the appeals court said in an unsigned opinion.

Mr. Trump used the emergency law early last month to tax imports from 90 countries. He previously invoked it to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico in response to what he said were those countries’ roles in the fentanyl trade.

The administration’s filing on Wednesday emphasized the importance of the tariffs to the president’s agenda and a need for the justices to act urgently.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers characterized the tariffs as the administration’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative,” which the president has “determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.”

A coalition of prominent conservative and libertarian lawyers, scholars and former officials filed a brief in June opposing Mr. Trump’s tariffs and emphasizing that the powers to tax must remain with Congress.

Under the act at issue in the case, the president can take certain steps in response to a declared emergency arising from an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” The law says that includes the power to regulate imports, language the Trump administration says means tariffs.

But the appeals court said the statute’s grant of power to the president to regulate imports did not authorize the particular tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

The majority did not address whether the president’s actions should have been taken as a matter of policy or whether the law ever permits a president to unilaterally impose tariffs.

In dissent, four judges nominated by presidents of both parties said the challengers had failed to show that the tariffs are not among the tools Congress permitted when it passed the 1977 law.

The statute “embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities available under nonemergency laws,” wrote Judge Richard G. Taranto, a nominee of President Barack Obama, who was joined by three other judges.

Harvard’s case centered on its research funding, and the university contended that the administration had compromised its First Amendment and due process rights when it sought to strip it away. The judge’s decision could give Harvard new leverage in its settlement talks with the White House.

Although the ruling was a milestone for Harvard, the only university to sue over the administration’s targeted assault on its research funding, President Trump had vowed to appeal any decision that went against him. His administration has spent months seeking to pressure Harvard in ways beyond research money, and while Judge Burroughs’s ruling may not put an end to that campaign, her opinion was a bracing rebuke.

“We must fight against antisemitism, but we equally need to protect our rights, including our right to free speech, and neither goal should nor needs to be sacrificed on the altar of the other,” Judge Burroughs wrote in an 84-page ruling. “Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs to take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be.”

She added, “Now it is the job of the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as required by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.”

As a part of the decision, Judge Burroughs said the Trump administration could not issue new blockades on Harvard’s federal research funding “in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms” of civil rights law.

The White House condemned the ruling.

“To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years,” said Liz Huston, a White House spokeswoman. “Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future.”

She added that the government would “appeal this egregious decision, and we are confident we will ultimately prevail in our efforts to hold Harvard accountable.”

Hours after the White House’s statement, Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, said the university would “continue to assess the implications of the opinion, monitor further legal developments and be mindful of the changing landscape in which we seek to fulfill our mission.”

But, he said, Judge Burroughs’s ruling “affirms Harvard’s First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the university’s academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.”

Judge Burroughs’s decision came on the second day of classes for the new academic year and after both the government and the university asked her to issue what is known as summary judgment — a ruling on the case’s claims without a trial. She largely ruled for Harvard, relying on voluminous filings, a select batch of evidence and oral arguments in her Boston courtroom on July 21 to reach a decision.

Harvard brought the case in April, after the Trump administration insisted that the nation’s oldest university had become a wellspring of bigotry. On April 11, it sent the school a letter trying to condition Harvard’s access to federal research money on its acquiescence to a range of demands.

Those terms included audits, the establishment of “merit-based” admissions and hiring policies, the shutdown of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and an examination of “programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”

Harvard refused on April 14. The administration took only hours to announce it would begin cutting off funding that Harvard, like other prominent universities, had long relied on to pay for research. The university sued a week later, accusing the government of ignoring its First Amendment protections and hastily barreling past the thicket of laws and regulations that govern how federal funding can be revoked.

“All told, the trade-off put to Harvard was clear: Allow the government to micromanage your viewpoints and your academic institution or jeopardize your ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries and innovative solutions,” lawyers for Harvard wrote in a court filing in June.

They added that the administration’s “content- and viewpoint-based attempt to coerce and control Harvard is blatantly unconstitutional.”

The Trump administration had insisted that it had the authority to cancel grants and contracts because, in its view, Harvard had not done enough to counter what it argued was rampant campus antisemitism. Federal research funds, the Justice Department asserted in one of its submissions to Judge Burroughs, were “not charitable gratuities.”

“Rather, the federal government grants funds to universities through contracts that include explicit conditions,” the Justice Department wrote, adding: “If they fail to meet these conditions, the grants are subject to cancellation.”

But the administration also hoped that Judge Burroughs would not issue much of a ruling at all. Its lawyers argued that an 1887 law meant that the suit, which the Justice Department depicted as a contractual matter, needed to be heard by a specialized court in Washington.

More recently, it urged the judge to consider the implications of an August decision by the Supreme Court in a different case. In that case, which also concerned federal grants, the court ruled that challenges to individual terminations should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. But it was a muddled ruling that left the door open for policy challenges in federal district courts.

Judge Burroughs acknowledged the Supreme Court’s decision on Wednesday and said she was “endeavoring” to follow it, but she largely asserted her own court’s jurisdiction.

“The First Amendment claims here are about speech and whether the federal government is improperly infringing on the free speech rights of an academic institution and its employees,” she wrote. “The resolution of these claims might result in money changing hands, but what is fundamentally at issue is a bedrock constitutional principle rather than the interpretation of contract terms.”

And Judge Burroughs, as she had in her courtroom in July, resisted the government’s efforts to tie research money to accusations of civil rights violations.

Judge Burroughs wrote on Wednesday that it was “difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

But Harvard leaders have privately fretted over the potential fallout of a protracted fight with the federal government, even if they won in Judge Burroughs’s court, and chose months ago to start parallel settlement talks.

That did not keep the government from intensifying its pressure campaign against the school, including by issuing cumbersome subpoenas and opening new investigations, like one focused on Harvard’s patents.

The New York Times reported in July that the university was open to spending $500 million to resolve the matter, but that Harvard was seeking an array of provisions to protect its independence.

Although the university and the administration have continued to move toward a potential agreement, they have not reached a settlement. Mr. Trump, who has taken a special interest in the financial terms of pacts his administration has reached with universities, said last week that he wanted “nothing less than $500 million from Harvard.”

“They’ve been very bad,” Mr. Trump told the education secretary, Linda McMahon, during a televised cabinet meeting. “Don’t negotiate.”

But Harvard officials had anticipated that a favorable decision from Judge Burroughs could help the university’s approach to the negotiations in two essential ways.

Such a ruling, they have reasoned, gives them a new way to pressure a government that might not wish to fight the university all the way to the Supreme Court.

And school officials, ever mindful of the university’s internal politics, have hoped that a legal victory would help them to portray any deal with the White House as part of a surrender by the administration.

Joseph Sellers and Corey Stoughton, lawyers for other organizations that also sued the administration over the attack on Harvard, including the American Association of University Professors, said they welcomed Wednesday’s ruling as “a decisive victory for academic freedom and research in the public interest.”

But, they added, “We hope this decision makes clear to Harvard’s administration that bargaining the Harvard community’s rights in a compromise with the government is unacceptable.”

Judge Burroughs’s decision arrived at a moment of high tension for Harvard. Federal regulations had the university preparing to submit “closeout” paperwork for some terminated grants on Wednesday.

Without a ruling by Wednesday, the university had warned the judge, it feared that “the government will take the position that no restoration of funds is possible.”

According to court documents, the defendants operated a prolific alien smuggling operation (ASO) that facilitated the unlawful entry of Cuban nationals into the United States by preparing visa applications, laundering millions of dollars in payment, and exploiting the immigration process.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“This indictment exposes a criminal organization that smuggled people into the United States on a massive scale, and then fraudulently secured immigration benefits for them,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Posing as a legitimate immigration service, the defendants used social media promotions and false legal filings to attract new clients and perpetuate their fraud. The Criminal Division and our law enforcement partners will continue to dismantle these schemes, protect vulnerable people from exploitation, and safeguard the integrity of the U.S. immigration system.”

“The defendants in this case conspired with others to deliberately violate our nation’s immigration laws while personally seeking to enrich themselves,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe for the Middle District of Florida. “Because of the interagency coordination and diligence of our dedicated law enforcement agencies, their crimes have been thwarted. We will continue working with our partners to protect our national borders.”

“This superseding indictment exposes the depth of a multi-year conspiracy of alien smuggling, asylum fraud, and money laundering that preyed on vulnerable individuals and weakened public trust in the immigration system,” said Acting Director Todd M. Lyons of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “This highlights the critical role ICE has in dismantling these criminal networks, combating immigration fraud, and ensuring criminals who abuse our systems are held accountable. We are absolute in our resolve to protect the integrity of our immigration system and safeguard our national security.

“It is because of the unfettered Department of Justice support we charge criminals with every available statute to provide consequences to those that erode the moral fabric of our society,” said Chief Jeffrey J. Dinise of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Miami Sector. “The message is clear, the United States is closed to illegal immigration and terrorist organizations, and those that make an attempt, will be met with fierce consequences. We are committed to protecting our Florida communities and safeguarding our nation.”

“Through diligent investigation, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and our partners exposed a multi-national, multi-year, multi-million dollar criminal conspiracy operated by aliens that attempted to undermine our immigration system and flood our country with illegal aliens — none of whom had any intention of following our laws,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This criminal organization operated a front for fake asylum claims, churning out frivolous applications around the country. To criminals who seek to exploit our immigration system: we will find you, shut down your schemes, and you will face justice.”

The superseding indictment charges:

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, 27, of Hialeah, FL (unlawfully residing in the United States);

Yuniel Lima-Santos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, 26, unlawfully residing in Lebanon, TN;

Marianny Lucia Lopez-Torres, 25, residing in Cuba, (formerly Hialeah, FL);

Frandy Aragon-Diaz, 33, of Cuba, (formerly unlawfully residing in Tampa, FL);

Erik Ventura-Castro, 23, residing in Hialeah, FL;

Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Walbis Pozo-Dutel, 30, residing in Katy, TX ;

Emanuel Martinez Gonzalez, 28, unlawfully residing in Hialeah, FL;

Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, 31, of Tampa, FL;

Layra Libertad Treto Santos, 31, of Tampa, FL; and

Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra, 40, of Tampa, FL.

According to the superseding indictment:

All defendants except Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra are charged with conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos and Frandy Aragon-Diaz are also charged with alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Layra Libertad Treto Santos, and Gisleivy Peralta Consuerga are charged with conspiracy to commit asylum fraud.

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Erik Ventura-Castro, Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, and Layra Libertad Treto Santos are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

From January 2021 through June 2025, the defendants promoted bogus visa services online, claiming Cuban nationals could secure U.S. entry through false claims of European citizenship. They filed hundreds of fraudulent Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using fake addresses and fabricated documents.

The ASO promoted its services on social media accounts and encrypted messaging platforms, including a WhatsApp group titled, “TRÁMITE DE ESTA Y VISA DE TURISMO A USA PARA CIUDADANOS ESPAÑOLES” (Processing of ESTA and tourist Visas to the USA for Spanish citizens). One promotional video advertised the scheme by showing stacks of passports, airline tickets, and visa approvals.

What began as a small operation grew into a commercial enterprise. The defendants charged clients between $1,500 and $40,000, sometimes even chartering private planes to move groups of aliens. Records show they spent over $2.5 million on flights alone and funneled more than $7 million through payment apps such as Zelle. Based on a financial analysis conducted of 27 known accounts associated with the defendants and their co-conspirators, the alien smuggling organization took in over $18 million during the course of the conspiracy.

The ASO also smuggled unaccompanied minors. In one case, a teenage girl was told to pose as the lifelong friend of an unrelated adult man when crossing the border.

The defendants operated a sham immigration business, ASESORIA Y SERVICIOS MIGRATORIOS LLC, which promised asylum filings, work permits, and residency applications. In reality, the company churned out boilerplate asylum claims without clients’ knowledge or consent and even blocked them from accessing their own USCIS online accounts.

ASESORIA marketed itself on Instagram with flashy ads for immigration services while simultaneously posting videos of aliens being smuggled into the country.

The investigation and superseding indictment were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

HSI Tampa, U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector, and USCIS’s’ Fraud Detection and National Security led U.S. investigative efforts, with substantial assistance from HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C. and CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force. Authorities in the Cayman Islands provided valuable assistance.

Trial Attorney Jenna Reed of the Criminal Division’s HRSP and Assistant U.S. Attorney Courtney Derry for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case.

A Michigan woman has been indicted for her role in an international alien smuggling conspiracy which brought aliens, including children, from Central America into the United States across the northern border.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“The defendant is charged with conspiring to smuggle families, including young children, across our northern border for profit,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Smuggling organizations threaten the security of our borders and undermines public safety. The Criminal Division is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to disrupt smuggling networks wherever they operate and bring their members to justice.”

“Those who promote and profit from smuggling migrants into the country take advantage of vulnerable individuals without regard for the safety of others,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael P. Drescher for the District of Vermont. “The prosecution of Ms. Lozano should send a message that those who commit these offenses will be investigated and held responsible, not only for their own criminal acts but also for facilitating illegal border crossings by others. Thank you to our law enforcement partners at the U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for their collaborative investigative work to keep our communities and country safe.”

“Human smuggling is a ruthless criminal enterprise that exploits vulnerable individuals for profit without regard for their life and safety,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol of HSI New England. “HSI remains steadfast in combating alien smuggling organizations and upholding the integrity of our borders.”

“I commend the unwavering dedication and vigilance of our agents in combating the dangers posed by smuggling operations along our northern border,” said Chief Robert N. Garcia of U.S. Border Patrol Swanton Sector. “Smuggling, whether it involves people, contraband, or other illicit activities, poses a significant threat to public safety and national security. The alleged actions of Norma Linda Lozano underscore the risks associated with these criminal enterprises and the critical need for robust enforcement efforts. I would also like to extend my appreciation to all of our partners in the investigation and indictment of Lozano. Their efforts are vital to ensuring that those who engage in these dangerous and illegal activities are held accountable.”

A federal grand jury charged Norma Linda Lozano, also known as Norma Linda Quintanilla Lozano, 53, of Ypsilanti, Michigan, with one count of conspiracy to smuggle aliens and six counts of bringing aliens to the United States for profit.

According to the indictment, from February through November 2024, Lozano participated in an alien smuggling organization (ASO) that brought and attempted to bring aliens from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, including children, illegally into the United States from Canada. The ASO instructed the aliens to cross the border on foot, provided GPS coordinates and a description of Lozano’s vehicle, and coordinated their pick-up once inside the United States.

Lozano allegedly drove from Michigan to Vermont to meet the aliens at prearranged locations near the border. She then transported the aliens further into the United States, delivering them to residences, businesses, or airports. The aliens or their family members allegedly paid Lozano for smuggling services.

In one smuggling event, Lozano allegedly transported three aliens from Guatemala and El Salvador in her car, with a five-year-old girl. The child rode in the front passenger seat, and Lozano falsely claimed the child was her granddaughter. In another smuggling event, she allegedly transported six adults along with an eight-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy. The girl was placed in the cargo area of the hatchback on top of luggage.

The investigation and indictment are the first brought in the District of Vermont coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA).

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
“This case demonstrates the ability of Joint Task Force Alpha and its domestic and international law enforcement partners to dismantle the most lethal human smuggling networks.
Human smuggling organizations profit by exploiting the vulnerable, putting lives at grave risk for financial gain.
They allegedly recruited Guatemalan aliens, collected payment, and arranged for the aliens to travel by foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks, and tractor-trailers.","The Justice Department announced today that three Guatemalan nationals charged in connection with the Dec. 9, 2021 mass casualty event in Chiapas, Mexico, have been extradited from Guatemala to the United States to face prosecution. The crash of a tractor-trailer packed with at least 160 illegal aliens – many of them Guatemalan – killed more than 50 people, including unaccompanied children, and injured over 100 more.

Yesterday’s extraditions are the result of sustained coordination between the Justice Department and Guatemalan authorities following an international enforcement operation carried out on Dec. 9, 2024, the third anniversary of the tragedy. The extraditions mark yet another significant step in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring those responsible to justice.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“Five Guatemalan smugglers charged in the Chiapas mass casualty incident are now in U.S. custody,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This case demonstrates the ability of Joint Task Force Alpha and its domestic and international law enforcement partners to dismantle the most lethal human smuggling networks. Human smuggling organizations profit by exploiting the vulnerable, putting lives at grave risk for financial gain. Even those smugglers who try to hide beyond the reach of the U.S. will be brought to justice for the death and suffering they have caused.”

“Human smugglers do not care if the people they transport live or die,” said U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei of the Southern District of Texas. “They do not care if unaccompanied children have food, water, or even air to breathe. They respect neither the law nor basic principles of decency. They care for only one thing — the blood money they make from the suffering of others. But these extraditions show that the United States will never tire in pursuing them. There is no border, no refuge that can shield these criminals from justice.”

Tomas Quino Canil, 37; Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino also known as Osvaldo ZQ, 25; and Josefa Quino Canil De Zavala, 43, were arrested in Boquerón, Guatemala on Dec. 9, 2024, pursuant to U.S. extradition requests, and were surrendered to U.S. authorities on Sept. 3, 2025. A fourth Guatemalan national, Daniel Zavala Ramos also known as “Dany ZR,” 41, was arrested on Aug. 7, 2025 in Boquerón and is pending extradition.

Two additional defendants were also arrested during the coordinated operation. Alberto Marcario Chitic also known as Alberto De Jesus, 32, was also arrested in Boquerón on Dec. 9, 2024, and extradited to the United States in May 2025. Jorge Agapito Ventura also known as Jorge Ventura, George Ventura, and El Raitero, 33, was arrested at his residence in Cleveland, Texas.

All six defendants are each charged in the Southern District of Texas with conspiracy to bring undocumented aliens to the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injury, and resulting in death. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

According to court documents, from Oct. 2021 to Feb. 2023, the defendants conspired with other smugglers to transport undocumented aliens from Guatemala though Mexico to the United States. They allegedly recruited Guatemalan aliens, collected payment, and arranged for the aliens to travel by foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks, and tractor-trailers. In some instances, including the smuggling of unaccompanied minors, the defendants provided scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended. Some of the aliens recruited by the defendants died or suffered serious bodily injury as result of the Dec. 9, 2021, crash.

HSI’s Counter Proliferation Investigations Group in Washington D.C. investigated the case in partnership with HSI Guatemala and HSI Mexico. Valuable assistance was provided by HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit; HSI Houston; HSI Laredo; U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center; Operation Sentinel; U.S. Border Patrol; Liberty County Constable, Precinct 6; ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Houston; U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division; and the Criminal Division’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training (OPDAT). The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs (OIA) provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions of the defendants. Guatemalan prosecutors and Mexican prosecutors from the Republic of Mexico’s Federal Prosecutions Office also known as Fiscalía General de la República (FGR), with the support of law enforcement officials from both countries, were also instrumental in furthering the investigation.

Senior Trial Attorney Danielle Hickman of the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mary Lou Castillo and Jennifer Day for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case, with substantial assistance from HRSP Latin American Specialist/Historian Joanna Crandall.

The indictment of these defendants is the result of the coordinated efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders.

Newsweek has analyzed numbers released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which provided recent records of immigrants to depart the U.S. through July 31, 2025.

Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, ICE had deported 145,419 illegal immigrants from its detention centers, peaking in June with a total of 27,970.

A Small But Rising Number of Self-Deportees

The chart above details the different categories ICE gives for remoivals, including deportation on the grounds of inadmissibility and voluntary departure.

In February, the first full month of Trump's second term, confirmed voluntary departures were at 592, the data showed. By July, that number had climbed to 4,241.

The beginning of the increase roughly aligns with the repurposing of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app. Under former President Joe Biden, CBP One was a tool for immigrants to book appointments with officials at the southwest border. The Trump administration transformed it into the CBP Home app, a tool for those without legal status to report self-deportation.

It was not immediately clear how many of those whom ICE marked as voluntary departures had used the CBP Home app to depart the country, and CBP has not published figures on the app's usage as of September 2025.

""One caveat on making judgements about use of this disposition is that it may or may not entirely reflect ICE policy, because [voluntary departure] is commonly offered by immigration judges too,"" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies told Newsweek.

Vaughan said it was important to note that 38 percent of voluntary departure cases under Trump came from the border, compared to 20 percent under Biden.

Has Trump Increased Deportations?

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has repeatedly touted high deportation numbers, but the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have not published consistent data on removals.

Under Biden, DHS shared monthly updates on immigration enforcement, with ICE data for July 2024 showing around 25,000 removals by ICE. That number was 23,250 this July, according to the data released under FOIA.

""More generally, there has been a significant increase in interior enforcement and in corresponding removals under Trump compared to the exact same period under Biden,"" Vaughan said.

""Most notably, under Trump, ICE has removed nearly double the number of aliens with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, which will result in safer communities across the country. Part of the reason for this has been the much greater engagement with state and local law enforcement agencies under Trump.""

This data gives some insight into how ICE has moved to deport its detainees since inauguration day, totaling more than 145,000 removals in six months. The number marks an increase in ICE deportations from within the U.S. compared to the same period last year under Biden, but then more immigrants were being turned around and sent back across the U.S.-Mexico border instead.

""I'd say that total removals are not much higher than they were last year—which could mean that there is a hard capacity limit on total removals,"" David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Newsweek.

""Nonetheless, that the number of removals of recent border crossers have fallen because fewer people are entering, while the number of removals of people here for more than six months has increased threefold.""

What Do We Know About Deportees?

The ICE data provides a breakdown of each individual immigrant to have officially left the U.S. under its jurisdiction, meaning there are also details on their nationality and whether they committed any crimes while in the U.S.

The majority of those deported since late January were from Mexico, with monthly totals far outpacing other nationalities. In May, 12,211 Mexicans were deported or left voluntarily, with Guatemalans, Venezuelans and Hondurans following in the low-thousands.

Not all immigrants are sent back to the country they came from, often because the U.S. does not have agreements with those nations, or countries do not accept repatriation flights.

In June, 240 Chinese nationals were deported, though China itself took 235 of them. Venezuela, a country with which the U.S. has a strained relationship, also saw fewer repatriations.

The Trump administration has also touted its efforts to arrested and deport the ""worst of the worst"" – that is, illegal immigrants who have either been convicted of serious crimes, or face criminal charges.

The data released by ICE also gave an insight into the criminality of the immigrants deported between the end of January and end of July. While more than 60,000 had no criminal convictions or pending charges, the vast majority of those deported by ICE were suspected or known criminals.

Though data publishing remains inconsistent under the Trump administration, these figures suggest a marked increase in removals of known criminals compared to previous years. However, recent detention data has suggested most of those being held in ICE facilities do not have any criminal convictions or pending charges.

""After successfully ending the invasion of our country and securing our southern border, President Trump established the visionary Project Homecoming in May to create a smooth, efficient process for illegal aliens to return home,"" a senior DHS official told Newsweek.

""By using the CBP Home App, illegal aliens will receive a complimentary one-way plane ticket home, a $1,000 exit bonus, and forgiveness of any fines previously assessed for failure to depart. Tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app, and 1.6 million illegal immigrants have left the United States population since January 20.""

The challenge for ICE now, coming up on nine months into Trump's second term, is to dramatically increase its enforcement numbers, from arrests through to deportations, as the president and his top advisor, Stephen Miller, are said to be demanding.

Under Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the agency has seen its budget supercharged, but more officers and expanded detention space will both take time to get online.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2715839/immigration-enforcement.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 22:57:46.543889

That breaks down to $71 million for food, $37 million for pay, $4 million for logistics supplies, $3.5 million for travel and $1.5 million for ""demobilization costs,"" according to Newsom's office, which released the numbers Thursday, citing the California National Guard.

On Tuesday, California asked a federal court to block a Trump administration order to continue their deployment through Nov. 5, the day after Newsom's special election will ask California voters to approve his redistricting plan.

Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled for the second time that Trump's deployment of the National Guard in L.A. was illegal. District Judge Charles R.

Human Rights and Global Wrongs

Donald Trump appears fixated on “creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote, holding that Trump’s deployment of federal troops to Los Angeles to enforce the immigration laws was illegal. Trump has already sent troops to Washington, D.C., and has also set his sights on Oakland, San Francisco, Chicago, and Baltimore.

Trump will appeal the ruling. The appellate courts will determine whether he will be allowed to use the military as his personal police force, notwithstanding the clear command of the Posse Comitatus Act.

In his 52-page decision, Breyer ruled that defendants Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the Department of Defense “willfully” violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military to enforce domestic laws. The act now forbids the willful use of “any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus [power of the county] or otherwise to execute the laws.” It only allows exceptions that are expressly authorized by the Constitution or act of Congress, such as the Insurrection Act, which Trump did not invoke.

Breyer concluded that, “at Defendants’ orders and contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws” in and around Los Angeles. “Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence.”

On June 7, without the consent of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump issued an edict under 10 U.S.C. section 12406 to activate National Guard units for “the enforcement of Federal law and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.”

In his edict, Trump also wrote that “To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

Not limiting his order to California, Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles for 60 days at the discretion of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. That number was later increased to 4,000 and the defendants also mobilized 700 Marines to deploy to Los Angeles. Three months later, 300 members of the National Guard remain stationed in L.A.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” Breyer noted. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”

Newsom and the State of California filed this case on June 9, and Breyer then found that Trump, Hegseth, and the Department of Defense illegally deployed federal troops to L.A. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled Breyer and held that the defendants had properly mobilized the troops under 10 U.S.C. section 12406, But the appellate court didn’t weigh in on the plaintiffs’ assertion that defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

Facts Adduced at Trial

Breyer presided over a trial from August 11 to August 13 that dealt with the merits of the plaintiffs’ Posse Comitatus claim.

It was established at trial that in early June 2025, “ICE targeted ‘several locations in downtown LA and its immediate surroundings’ that are ‘known to have significant migrant populations and labour-intensive industries’ … Public protests quickly followed.” Breyer wrote that the L.A. Police Department and the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department “responded to these protests and maintained control of the situation.”

Nevertheless, the defendants deployed military forces to L.A. and they were put under the control of Task Force 51, which received training on the permissible scope of their activities under the Posse Comitatus Act. Their training materials said that “active-duty military personnel may not provide ‘direct, active assistance to civilian law enforcement authorities by performing law enforcement functions,’ unless a Constitutional or an Act of Congress exception specifically permits it.”

Task Force 51 was given a list of “Prohibited Law Enforcement Functions,” which included “active, direct”: (1) Pursuit, (2) Arrests, (3) Apprehension, (4) Search, (5) Seizure, (6) Security patrols, (7) Traffic control, (8) Riot control, (9) Crowd Control, (10) Evidence collection, (11) Interrogation, and (12) Acting as Informants. But Task Force 51 troops were orally instructed that 4 of 12 listed functions that were highlighted in red — security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, and riot control — “were subject to a so-called constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer noted.

Moreover, the Defense Department instructed the Northern Command and Task Force 51 “that the President and Secretary’s June 7 memoranda created a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and thereby authorized Task Force 51 to engage in the four functions listed in red,” Breyer added.

Task Force 51 troops and some Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wore camouflage uniforms, which made it difficult to differentiate them at a distance. Task Force 51 troops carried weapons with live ammunition.

“The presence of Task Force 51 deterred engagement by the public, especially by those who might have attempted to hinder or protest an arrest by ICE agents,” Breyer noted.

Breyer Rejects Trump’s Invention of a “Constitutional Exception” to Posse Comitatus

The defendants argued that there is a “constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, which gives the president inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, personnel, and functions.

“Under this ‘constitutional exception,’ as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such ‘protection’ are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer wrote. “This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.”

The judge cited the defendants’ knowing contradiction of their own training manuals and their refusal to coordinate with state and local officials. Breyer noted that Trump, Hegseth, and the Department of Defense “‘coach[ed]’ federal law enforcement agencies as to what language to use when submitting requests for assistance in an attempt to circumvent the Act … These actions demonstrate that Defendants knew that they were ordering troops to execute domestic law beyond their usual authority. Whether they believed that some constitutional or other exception applied does not matter; ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse.’”

During the trial, Breyer was incredulous at the defendants’ arguments. “Are you saying because the president says it, therefore it is?,” the judge asked. “In other words, we’re going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines there’s some threat to the safety of a federal agent.”

Breyer Issues a Narrow Injunction

Breyer issued an injunction forbidding the defendants from using the National Guard troops currently deployed to Los Angeles from enforcing the law. Defendants are not required to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops from L.A. And they are not prevented from using the troops for purposes consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, such as protecting federal property.

Under Breyer’s order, Hegseth and the Department of Defense are enjoined from:

deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops heretofore deployed in California, to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until Defendants satisfy the requirements of a valid constitutional or statutory exception, as defined herein, to the Posse Comitatus Act.

This order applies only to the defendants’ use of the National Guard in California, not nationally. Breyer stayed his injunction until September 12, 2025, ostensibly to provide the defendants an opportunity to appeal his ruling.

True to form, Trump reacted to the ruling by calling Breyer “a radical left judge.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who filed the lawsuit, applauded Breyer’s decision. The ruling “affirms that President Trump is not King, and the power of the executive is not boundless,” Bonta said in a news release. He added:

For more than two months, the President has engaged in political theater, using National Guard troops and Marines as pawns to further his anti-immigrant agenda. In doing so, he trampled on one of the very basic foundations of our democracy: That our military be apolitical and the activities of troops on U.S. soil be extremely limited to ensure civil liberties and protect against military overreach.

But in light of the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision giving presidents monarchical powers, a ruling that reverses Breyer’s decision would not be surprising.

“The stakes are huge,” Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law, told the Los Angeles Times. “If this District Court decision is reversed by either the 9th Circuit or the Supreme Court or both … the Trump administration would go hog wild.”

The reactivation of the contract between the Department of Homeland Security and Paragon Solutions, a known spyware vendor, is extremely troubling.

This end run around the executive order both ignores the spirit of the rule and does not actually do anything to prevent misuse of Paragon Malware for human rights abuses

Paragon's “Graphite” malware has been implicated in widespread misuse by the Italian government. Researchers at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and with Meta found that it has been used in Italy to spy on journalists and civil society actors, including humanitarian workers. Without strong legal guardrails, there is a risk that the malware will be misused in a similar manner by the U.S. Government.

These reports undermine Paragon Solutions’s public marketing of itself as a more ethical provider of surveillance malware.

Reportedly, the contract is being reactivated because the US arm of Paragon Solutions was acquired by a Miami based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, and then merged into a Virginia based cybersecurity company, REDLattice, allowing ICE to circumvent Executive Order 14093 which bans the acquisition of spyware controlled by a foreign government or person. Even though this order was always insufficient in preventing the acquisition of dangerous spyware, it was the best protection we had. This end run around the executive order both ignores the spirit of the rule and does not actually do anything to prevent misuse of Paragon Malware for human rights abuses. Nor will it prevent insider threats at Paragon using their malware to spy on US government officials, or US government officials from misusing it to spy on their personal enemies, rivals, or spouses.",https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/mobile-privacy.png,N,,2025-09-04 15:57:16.330297

Ms. McIver, a first-term House member from Newark, was outside the detention center on May 9 when agents, wearing masks and camouflage gear, moved in to arrest Mr. Baraka on trespassing charges, leading to a volatile scrum. Video showed her pushing toward the gates and being pushed from behind after Mr. Baraka was handcuffed.

Ms. McIver was there for a House oversight visit and, immediately after the incident, was invited into the facility and led on a tour with two of her Democratic colleagues, Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez.

Ten days later, Alina Habba, New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, announced in a news release that she was dropping the trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka — but would pursue charges against Ms. McIver. A grand jury later handed up an indictment that accused Ms. McIver of “forcibly grabbing” one agent and “using her forearms” to strike a second agent as she sought to block the mayor’s arrest.

Representative Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, moved to censure Ms. McIver and remove her from Homeland Security — a committee he quit last week, noting that he was no longer in sync with fellow Republican committee members who were “more in alignment with the less conservative factions of our conference.”

Mr. Higgins’s resolution argues that Ms. McIver’s actions “do not reflect creditably on the House” and that the charges she faced presented a conflict of interest on a committee that oversees federal immigration enforcement.

The House clerk who read the resolution aloud on Wednesday afternoon was repeatedly interrupted by a chorus of boos, only to be told: “Read over them.”

Then, Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, moved to table the resolution, drawing supportive votes from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans and two Republican members of the Ethics Committee, who might eventually be asked to consider ethics violations tied to the incident.

The resolution could be reconsidered at a later date.

In a statement, Mr. Higgins called out the Republicans who either supported Ms. Clark’s motion or abstained from taking a position by voting “present”: Representatives Don Bacon of Nebraska; Mike Flood of Nebraska; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Mike Turner of Ohio; David Valadao of California; Andrew Garbarino of New York; and Nathaniel Moran of Texas.

“Talk to these guys,” Mr. Higgins said. “They’re the Republicans who failed to stand with federal law enforcement.”

Ms. McIver reacted with trademark defiance on Tuesday night when it became clear that Mr. Higgins’s effort to oust her from the committee would reach the House floor.

“Instead of making life any better for the people he represents, he’s seeking to punish me for doing what he and his caucus are too cowardly to do: conduct real oversight, stand up to this administration and do our jobs,” she said in a statement. “If House Republicans think they can make me run scared, they’re wrong.”

At the center of the controversy is the Newark detention center, which is known as Delaney Hall and is run by one of the country’s largest private prison companies, GEO Group. It has a contract with ICE to hold as many as 1,000 migrants at risk of deportation in its two-floor jailhouse.

In the weeks before Mr. Baraka’s arrest, he had argued in court and in visits to Delaney Hall that it had not been fully inspected and was operating without a valid certificate of occupancy.

His concerns about the safety of the facility proved prescient when, weeks later, unrest over food portions and crowding ended only after four men escaped through a jailhouse wall. The men lowered mattresses to the ground on June 13 and then lashed bedsheets together to escape, according to court records. The last of the four men was located and rearrested five weeks later.

Ms. Habba, a former personal lawyer to Mr. Trump, has led the U.S. attorney’s office since late March, courting controversy as she pursued high-profile cases against New Jersey Democrats. After district court judges declined to extend her tenure, the Justice Department resorted to an extraordinary series of legal maneuvers to keep her in office. That drew immediate legal challenges to her authority from several defendants in pending criminal cases.

Last month, a federal judge concluded that Ms. Habba has not been the lawful leader of the office since July 1, but he delayed the effect of the ruling until after the matter is reviewed by an appeals court, leaving the federal courts in New Jersey at a virtual standstill.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/03/multimedia/03MET-McIVER-pckw/03MET-McIVER-pckw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 17:56:51.796154

In President Trump’s August 11 emergency declaration, he invoked Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, which allows the president to declare an emergency in D.C. and require the “services” of the Metropolitan Police Department for “Federal purposes,” which is the one statutory exception to local control of MPD.

Even under Section 740, Congress reserved day-to-day control of MPD to D.C.’s local elected officials, not to the federal government. And under Section 740, MPD services are to be used for “Federal purposes” under emergency conditions. By attempting to give the federal government full operational control of MPD, including its local law enforcement efforts, for the purpose of addressing crime in the city, which is at a 30-year low, President Trump has far exceeded his statutory authority under Section 740.

The Trump administration’s attempted D.C. takeover is a frightening step in President Trump’s ongoing weaponization of government against his perceived political opponents. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has used federal law enforcement to seemingly threaten and intimidate his critics, and is now encroaching on D.C. local affairs to intimidate the city’s residents. This aggressive use of law enforcement stands in stark contrast to President Trump’s conduct during the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump group, when he failed to promptly mobilize federal law enforcement as violence persisted in the Capitol for hours, resulting in the death of a Capitol Police officer and injuries to approximately 140 other law enforcement officers.

President Trump’s interference in local law enforcement matters is not limited to just D.C. In June, the Trump administration sent the California National Guard into Los Angeles to quell protests against the Trump administration’s immigration policy without the consent of the state’s governor, and the Pentagon is reportedly preparing to send the Illinois National Guard into Chicago despite the opposition of the state’s governor. Attempting to take over law enforcement in those cities disrupts the delicate balance of state and federal power established by the Constitution.

The attempted D.C. takeover highlights the city’s precarious legal status and the need for statehood. It also may be a testing ground for more extreme authoritarian action in the future. Congress must stand up against this unjustified attack on D.C. and the Constitution by passing H.J. Res. 115 to end the D.C. takeover.",https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DCDeployment-1200x630.png,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:02.969239

In their court declarations, the unaccompanied children said they don’t want to go back to Guatemala or that their parents never requested their return.
Another judge in Arizona blocked the removals of 53 other Guatemalan minors in the state last week.","Guatemalan migrant children say they remain “traumatized” and “depressed” after the Trump administration attempted to quietly remove them from the United States during the holiday weekend despite having pending immigration cases, according to new court declarations.

A declaration by a 16-year-old describes how multiple Guatemalan children at a Texas shelter were awoken in the middle of the night Saturday and told they would be returned to their native country in a matter of hours.

“I am afraid to return to Guatemala,” said the teen, who fled Guatemala last year following their sister’s murder, according to a court declaration. “I was worried that I would be killed.”

“At around 2:30 a.m., I called my mother to tell her I might be deported to Guatemala. My mom started crying,” states the declaration from the teen, who is only identified by the initials A.J.D.E. in court records.

The mother, who lives in Guatemala, was not aware of any plan to have her child removed from the U.S., according to the teen’s declaration. “She does not want me to return. She does not have the resources to care for me. My father is not a part of my life. I have no other family who could receive me.”

Thirteen other declarations from teens like A.J.D.E, most of whom are 16 and 17, were filed in court Wednesday as part of the ongoing legal challenge that on Labor Day weekend temporarily blocked the removals of any unaccompanied Guatemalan child in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement who does not have a final removal order.

In the documents, the teens describe fearing gang recruitment in their home country as well as violence from relatives, criminal organizations and even the Guatemalan government.

A.J.D.E.’s declaration said he still feels “totally traumatized. ... I don’t even know how to explain it.”

A 17-year-old at another Texas shelter woke up at 2 a.m. Sunday so scared that “I felt like I lost my breath for a second.” In a declaration, the teen, identified in court records by the initials A.R.M.D., stated: “I just keep thinking about them trying to return me to Guatemala. I feel depressed.”

The U.S. government and Guatemalan officials have said their efforts to remove unaccompanied Guatemalan children in ORR custody are “repatriations” and “reunifications of children,” according to court transcripts and public statements. The removals are part of an agreement reached between the two nations following Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s visit to Guatemala in July.

But legal advocates representing the minors dispute that the attempted removals were “repatriations” and not attempted deportations, stating there’s no indication that ICE is complying with obligations “to provide access to counsel or with the mandated safeguards it must implement before children agree to voluntary departure,” according to the lawsuit.

“If these are benign repatriations, that’s not how they happen,” said Efrén C. Olivares, vice president of litigation and legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center, the organization that filed the lawsuit blocking the minors’ removal to Guatemala. He spoke at a virtual congressional briefing on Tuesday.

Dozens of advocates and organizations providing legal immigration services to many of these minors have characterized the attempted removals as “unlawful” because they disregarded a series of legal protections Congress granted to unaccompanied migrant children who are in federal custody as they go through immigration proceedings.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 outlines some of these protections. It generally requires children be placed in the “least restrictive setting possible” throughout the duration of their immigration proceedings. It also establishes protocols for safe repatriations and family reunifications to ensure the safety of these unaccompanied minors, who are considered among the most vulnerable migrant children.

Under these protocols, a child can request a voluntary departure that must be authorized by an immigration judge to ensure the child is not being coerced to return or a parent can come forward to claim their child.

In their court declarations, the unaccompanied children said they don’t want to go back to Guatemala or that their parents never requested their return.

Other declarations submitted by the attorneys representing the minors also included statements from some of their parents in Guatemala saying they never asked for their children to be returned.

Jennifer Anzardo Valdes, director of children’s legal services at the International Rescue Committee, told NBC News that two unaccompanied Guatemalan teenage girls her organization represents in Texas went before an immigration judge last Friday and were told their names were on a list of children who wanted to return to Guatemala.

“The children told the judge that was not true and that they were scared to go home,” Anzardo Valdes said. “So the judge continued the case for them to be able to continue their immigration application.”

Still, both girls and a third unaccompanied minor that IRC represents were picked up from their foster homes in the middle of the night and put on a bus. They were kept for over 12 hours Sunday before being returned to an ORR facility without the ability to say goodbye to their original foster families, according to Anzardo Valdes.

“All of them were really sad to be pulled away from their foster home,” she said.

They were also “terrified,” Valdes said, pointing out that one of the girls is Mayan, which is the largest Indigenous group in Guatemala. The girl said she comes from “a community where kids disappeared” and thought “that was going to happen to me.”

It is estimated that the federal government intends to remove up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children from the U.S., according to whistleblower reports cited by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon in a letter he sent to the Office of Refugee Resettlement last week.

Court records show immigration authorities placed at least 76 minors in planes to Guatemala that were later grounded. Another judge in Arizona blocked the removals of 53 other Guatemalan minors in the state last week. Court declarations and accounts from organizations providing legal immigration services to the children show that minors in ORR custody across at least eight states are at risk of being removed under these circumstances.

“Children who are in ORR custody have fled difficult circumstances. Some have been orphans, some have been persecuted, abandoned, trafficked or sold,” said Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, during the virtual congressional briefing Tuesday.

“All of them have experienced significant trauma that remains ongoing,” Aber said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250904-guatemalan-children-ch-0955-727857.jpg",N,,2025-09-04 14:58:05.984593

(WTVO) — As Chicago prepares for a surge of immigration enforcement agents, the city of Rockford issued a statement Wednesday in solidarity with its noncitizen community, with the warning that ICE operations could extend to the Forest City.

The City posted a notice to its Facebook page in both English and Spanish, saying, “We are aware that Homeland Security recently confirmed plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago. While there is no confirmation that these operations will extend to Rockford, we recognize it is a possibility. And, we also recognize the fear and uncertainty this news may cause.”

“It’s also important to be clear – the Rockford Police Department follows the Illinois Trust Act. We do not participate in ICE raids, nor will we,” the statement continued. “To our immigrant neighbors: please know this — you are valued, you are cared for and you are an important part of who we are.”

Rockford Police Chief Carla Redd also released a statement, saying, “It is important for our community to know that the enforcement of civil immigration laws is the responsibility of federal agencies, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as stated in the Illinois Trust Act. Our duty is to protect and serve everyone in our community, regardless of immigration status.”

The TRUST Act, signed by former Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) in 2017, prevents state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

According to ICE, those arrested as part of the nationwide effort had criminal histories, including sexual assault, robbery, drug and weapons charges, and domestic violence, the agency said.

The Department of Homeland Security conducted operations in Rockford in mid-June, but it has not been confirmed whether the agents were from ICE.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said federal troops will be coming to Chicago as part of an immigration enforcement effort, but did not give a timeline for the operation.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker held a news conference later that day, saying the head of the Illinois State Police had received a call from Customs and Border Protection’s chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino on Saturday.

The governor said the White House began positioning armed federal agents and military vehicles at the Great Lakes Naval Base on Monday.

“Unidentifiable agents in unmarked vehicles with masks are planning to raid Latino communities and say they’re targeting violent criminals,” Pritzker said, adding that he expects to see videos of “them hauling away mothers and fathers traveling to work or picking up their kids from school.”

“We have reason to believe that [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,” he continued.

Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said undocumented immigrants should “prioritize your health, mental wellness, and safety above all else.”

Pritzker characterized undocumented immigrants in Chicago as “law-abiding individuals who pay taxes and pay taxes and contribute to the communities.”

“In other words, they’re following the law,” Pritzker said.

U.S. federal law (8 U.S. Code § 1325), makes it illegal for someone to enter the United States at any time or place between an official port of entry.

Pritzker also said he believed “Trump and his team will be looking for any excuse to put active duty military on our streets, supposedly to protect ICE,” and said “We have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois.”

Chicago is home to a large population of undocumented immigrants, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with Trump‘s mass deportation agenda.

The Governor said the Chicago surge is expected to last 30 days.",https://www.mystateline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/09/Rockford-welcome-sign.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:54.265024

Training to become an immigration judge Traditionally, immigration judges are appointed by the Attorney General and serve within the Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR).
Until recently, the qualifications for immigration judges included admission to a state bar, several years of post bar legal experience and demonstrated knowledge of immigration law.
But the administration said it would waive those requirements to allow military lawyers to fill the roles.
There are also no standard operating procedures or guidelines for how military lawyers should operate as immigration judges.","There is no precedent in peacetime for using military lawyers in civilian courtrooms — the last time U.S. military officers exercised judicial authority over civilians was under martial law during World War II, a practice the Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional. Now, the Pentagon’s plan to use its military lawyers as immigration judges is setting a precedent with no clear limits that could fundamentally reshape civil-military relations in the United States.

“Whatever happens here is going to establish some precedent for future administrations, and if we normalize using military resources to address civilian government staffing challenges, which is ultimately what this is, we are fundamentally altering the nature of American governance,” Ira Rushing, an associate at the Tully Rinckey law firm, told Federal News Network.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week approved a plan to detail up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges — an effort aimed at easing a backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has grown in recent years.

Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told Federal News Network the Defense Department is currently identifying Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details; these attorneys will “augment existing resources to help further combat a backlog of cases by presiding over immigration hearings.” These military lawyers will serve as immigration judges for about six months, but their assignments can be renewed.

It is unclear what authority the DoD is using to lend its attorneys to the Justice Department. Rushing said the administration appears to be relying on Title 10 authority, which allows the Defense Department to provide support to civilian agencies as long as it does not violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of active-duty military forces for domestic law enforcement.

At the same time, there are other laws, such as the Economy Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act, that allow interagency support.

But immigration judges are not just federal employees performing administrative functions — they hold judicial power that directly affects individual liberty interests.

“There’s really never been this question of military personnel themselves serving in a quasi-judicial civilian role, I know what the mindset is — we want to use these military lawyers to do these administrative law roles and that’s not law enforcement. It’s just administrative law. But it really threads this needle by arguing that adjudicating civil immigration cases doesn’t constitute law enforcement, because immigration enforcement itself involves detention, removal proceedings and determinations that directly affect personal liberty,” Rushing said.

“While the immigration proceedings are technically civil rather than criminal, the Supreme Courts recognize this quasi-criminal nature of immigration proceedings, given the severe consequences. We are theoretically doing administrative law, but the effect is in law enforcement,” he added.

In addition, if the National Guard and Reserve members are involuntarily called up for this duty under Title 10 rather than Title 32, it is unclear what funds would be used to pay them.

“Can you have an appropriation under Title 10 that pays National Guardsmen to act as a civilian judicial officer? I don’t know. Those are going to be some questions that will probably be flashed out pretty heavily here in the next couple of weeks,” Rushing said.

There is also the issue of judicial independence that comes from putting military officers into judicial roles. U.S. judges are supposed to be free from outside pressures and make impartial decisions based solely on facts and law, but military lawyers remain in a chain of command that could expose them to unlawful command influence.

“What’s going to happen to a Judge Advocate who makes several decisions in favor of the people going through the immigration proceeding? What’s going to be the effect on their career if they make a bunch of decisions that this administration doesn’t like?” Rushing said.

In the end, detailing military judges to the Justice Department is a decision the administration has every right to pursue, Rushing said. But ultimately the question is not whether this is legal or practical — it is whether this is the precedent the U.S. wants to set for the relationship between military and civilian authority.

“Using military officers to adjudicate civil proceedings involving lawful permanent residents in some cases, and asylum seekers on U.S. soil during peacetime — it’s just going to be the Wild West. We’ve always maintained this clear separation between military and civilian spheres. And that’s not tradition. It’s fundamental to democratic governance. But once you start using military personnel to perform what are inherently civilian governmental functions, you erode that boundary,” Rushing said.

“I think a lot of concern from some people is, ‘Today it’s immigration judges. Tomorrow, could it be administrative law judges for social security claims? What about the tax court?’ The principle being established here that military personnel can be deployed, essentially to address civilian judicial backlogs, really has no natural limiting principle. And how does this look internationally? We’ve always criticized other nations for military involvement in civilian justice systems,” he added.

Training to become an immigration judge

Traditionally, immigration judges are appointed by the Attorney General and serve within the Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR).

Until recently, the qualifications for immigration judges included admission to a state bar, several years of post bar legal experience and demonstrated knowledge of immigration law.

“A lot of people say immigration law is second only to tax law in its complexities,” Rushing said.

Immigration judges are part of the excepted service, meaning they fall outside the competitive civil service system, but they still require specific qualifications and vetting.

But the administration said it would waive those requirements to allow military lawyers to fill the roles.

“Some people have said it is like going to a cardiologist for hip surgery,” Rushing said.

Over the course of their careers, military lawyers usually gain experience as prosecutors, trial counsel and defense attorneys — they handle cases ranging from minor offense such as absence without leave to serious crimes including sexual assault, murder or espionage. They also get experience practicing international and operational law. But they get little to no exposure to immigration law during their military service.

“You theoretically could get all of the training and instruction you needed, but it’s going to be really hard, because a lot of these people who are really good at immigration law have been doing it for years and years and years, and most military lawyers typically do a little bit of everything, but really not immigration,” Rushing said.

Parnell said the Defense Department is “committed to continuing our support for our interagency partners, bringing the skills and dedication of America’s service members and civil servants to deliver justice, restore order and protect the American people.”

What’s next

Rushing said it is unclear who would even have standing to challenge this decision in courts.

“We would have to wait for, say, an asylum seeker to not like their decision and sue based on the lack of qualifications of the judge that handled their case,” he said.

“If you think of this purely as a federal administrative personnel move, I don’t know if we’ll see it in the courts as quickly as we’ll see it just having to kind of play out in a fumbling sort of manner over the next few weeks,” Rushing added.

There are also no standard operating procedures or guidelines for how military lawyers should operate as immigration judges. “It’s going to fall on a lot of military lawyers themselves to figure out what it looks like,” Rushing said.

The lawsuit alleges the president’s unilateral deployment of National Guard troops from other states to patrol the city without the mayor’s consent violates the Home Rule Act, which gives Washington residents control over local affairs, with Congress retaining ultimate authority over the district.

The lawsuit, filed by city Attorney General Brian Schwalb, argues that President Donald Trump “disregarded Congress’s decision, half a century ago, to afford the residents of the District ‘the powers of local self-government,’ including the authority to police the District as they see fit. In so doing, he has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy—that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Schwalb said in a statement to NBC News. “It’s DC today, but could be any other city tomorrow. We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

The city’s lawsuit comes the same week that a federal judge ruled the federal government illegally deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in June in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal law that generally prohibits the U.S. military from acting as domestic law enforcement.

At the same time as the city is pushing back on the deployment of the National Guard, D.C.

The agreement, known as 287(g), was signed by the City Manager and Police Chief without a commission vote.

Some commissioners expressed concern over potential retaliation from Gov. Ron DeSantis if they oppose the agreement.

Should it stay, or should it go?

The Tallahassee City Commission is biding its time in determining what to do about the immigration enforcement assistance agreement between the Tallahassee Police Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a unanimous vote Sept. 3, commissioners followed the lead of Mayor John E. Dailey, who asked that the city wait for further judicial review in connection to an ongoing case in South Florida before moving forward with any resolutions.

That case questions whether Florida cities and towns are required to enter immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. The specific agreement in question, known as 287(g), allows ""ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations to partner with state and local law enforcement to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S.,"" according to the ICE website.

The city's 287(g) agreement with the feds never reached commissioners but was instead signed by City Manager Reese Goad and Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell, who are both appointed.

The issue was a continuation from the commission's August meeting. Commissioners once again expressed concern over retaliation threatened by Gov. Ron DeSantis in regards to threats made to sitting local elected officials that they will be removed from office if they oppose the agreement.

""Diverting our law enforcement to help ICE ... take immigrants, who serve a major purpose in Florida, off the streets is not only inhumane but not necessary,"" said one public speaker, Sue Massa. ""I'd like to encourage the city to step up like they did during COVID and refuse and rescind the agreement they signed. Simple as that.""

City commissioners talk about commitment to community

Commissioner Jeremy Matlow kicked off discussion by claiming that what was happening with law enforcement was just profiling: ""I had a troubling conversation with a friend of mine since our last meeting. He got pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol and the first question he was asked was, 'Are you a U.S. citizen?' ""

Matlow, also a mayoral candidate, added: ""To the threat of removal from office: Remove me. I'll be back. The governor didn't send me here.""

Commissioner Jack Porter piggybacked on Matlow's comments: ""We're the last line of defense in a state where we don't have our governor standing up for us, (nor) our attorney general and certainly not our federal government. If we allow ourselves to be silenced, we are allowing ... residents to be silenced.""

Commissioners Curtis Richardson and Dianne Williams-Cox had previously expressed hesitation on sending a message, pointing specifically to threats of losing their seats. While the hesitation remained, they said that it had nothing to do with their beliefs.

""I've taken a stand. I stood when the governor sought to remove black history from our schools. I stood at a press conference and declared that slavery was not good for us,"" Williams-Cox said. ""Don't tell me that I need to take a stand. I'm taking the stand but, unfortunately, I didn't see you standing with me.""

Dailey assured the community the commission would do the best they can.

""I'm extremely concerned about federal agents that are masked in other communities across this country, that are arresting people and carrying them away,"" Dailey said. ""We do have a responsibility to take care and protect this community, and we're going to do everything we possibly can.""","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PTAL/83919803007-img-6477.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-04 13:57:31.683081

“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.","CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago community leaders forged ahead Wednesday with preparations for the influx of National Guard troops and immigration agents the city is expecting, advising residents about their rights and organizing protests with fresh urgency.

Details about the operation are scant, but President Donald Trump has amped up the rhetoric about crime in the nation’s third-largest city, saying an immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment are planned despite the objections of local leaders and a federal court ruling that a similar deployment in Los Angeles was illegal.

The preparations seem familiar in the Democratic stronghold that’s often found itself in Trump’s crosshairs.

Still, leaders of schools, churches and community groups — particularly in the city’s immigrant enclaves and Black and Latino neighborhoods — say there’s increased gravity and coordination in preparing for the expected troop deployment and its accompanying deluge of attention.

Here’s how Chicago is preparing.

Protesters say they’re ready

Even without knowing what will unfold, Chicago’s energetic activist networks circulated “emergency protest” schedules, vowing to demonstrate within hours of federal intervention.

Organizers from immigrant rights groups, unions, clergy and anti-violence organizations said they’re working together more than ever.

“We have a stronger broader movement preparing to mobilize,” said Lawrence Benito, head of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “People still have to go about their lives. We’re making sure folks are prepared and we’re ready to respond.”

Immigrant communities have been on high alert since Trump took office for the second time in January and kicked off a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

Activists say they’ve already offered countless know-your-rights training sessions and have added hours for a hotline where people can report immigration arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order reiterating the city’s longtime sanctuary policies, which bar local police from coordinating with federal immigration agents.

Trump’s plans for Chicago

Trump signaled this week that he’s ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago despite the objections of Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Trump hasn’t given a timeline for the Chicago operation, and he muddied the outlook again on Wednesday by suggesting New Orleans as the next possible location.

Trump’s administration indicated that it would soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, and the Department of Homeland Security requested limited logistical support at the Naval Station Great Lakes outside the city.

The administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. His administration plans to appeal the California deployment ruling.

Trump has often singled out Chicago and other Democrat-led cities. Recently, his administration started playing up the city’s daily crime log, including using shootings over Labor Day weekend as justification for sending in troops.

“I want to go into Chicago and I have this incompetent governor,” Trump said Wednesday.

He and Pritzker have traded barbs for days about the issue. Pritzker, a two-term governor and frequent Trump critic, has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential contender.

“I can’t live in a fantasy land where I pretend Trump is not tearing this country apart for personal greed and power,” Pritzker posted Wednesday on X. At an event later in the day, he told reporters his office had not received any additional information from the federal government.

There has been little outward support for Trump’s plans in Chicago, with only a handful of Republicans and conservative leaders saying they’d welcome the intervention.

Johnson and Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to the city’s drop in crime, and asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead.

Echoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.

A damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations

Chicago is home to a large and thriving Mexican community, and the threat of the troop deployment and immigration crackdown has put a damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations planned over the next two weeks.

Organizers acknowledged the threat of immigration arrests might keep some people at home, but they’re boosting security measures and inviting more allies. It’s a similar tactic that activists tried for annual May Day protests, when fears about public gatherings were also high.

Teresa Fraga, who is organizing an event in the city’s heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood, said the event has hired more security, lawyers and neighborhood patrols.

“It’s a dark cloud that is hanging over our heads,” she said. “But we are planning a safe event.”

Worries in Black neighborhoods

Worries are also high in many of the city’s Black neighborhoods, where organizations have been busy advising residents about what their rights are should they interact with law enforcement.

Dozens of Black churches plan to take part in “Resistance Sunday” this weekend, to disseminate information about legal rights during traffic stops and other encounters.

“We need resources, not troops,” said the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a prominent civil rights activist. “We’re not interested in this charade of troops.”

Johnson and other Black mayors have called Trump’s targeting of Democratic cities racist. And Trump has often used racist narratives about urban crime when talking about the unprecedented deployment of troops in the nation’s capital.

“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.

City schools prepare

Chicago’s public school system suggested that families create phone trees to quickly share information and organize walk-to-school groups to “provide safety in numbers.”

“We know that the potential of increased federal presence is creating anxiety and fear about safety at school and safety within the broad community,” Chicago Public Schools wrote in a letter to parents.

Billions in U.S. foreign aid, relied on by nonprofits and global health programs, hang in the balance, with potential ripple effects for American influence abroad and the survival of organizations that depend on federal funding.
Pocket Rescission President Donald Trump has framed the move as part of a broader effort to rein in government spending and realign U.S. foreign policy priorities.
On January 20, he issued ""Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid,"" pausing U.S. development assistance and directing agencies to review all programs.
What Happens Next The order blocking the Trump administration from withholding about $12 billion in foreign aid sets up an accelerated legal battle.","A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has barred the Trump administration from unilaterally withholding billions of dollars in foreign assistance funds approved by Congress, delivering a major legal setback to the president's efforts to scale back overseas aid.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that the administration's refusal to spend roughly $12 billion in congressionally appropriated funds likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which governs how federal agencies make decisions. The decision follows months of litigation over whether the White House can delay or block spending approved under the 2024 appropriations law, much of which is set to expire on September 30 if not obligated.

Why It Matters

The case goes beyond a fight over foreign aid dollars. At stake is the balance of power between Congress and the presidency, with the courts asked to decide whether a president can effectively override appropriations by letting funds expire. The ruling could set a precedent for how future administrations handle contested spending.

It also carries immediate consequences. Billions in U.S. foreign aid, relied on by nonprofits and global health programs, hang in the balance, with potential ripple effects for American influence abroad and the survival of organizations that depend on federal funding.

What To Know

The ruling came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sent the matter back to Ali for consideration of statutory claims under the APA.

An earlier injunction based on constitutional separation-of-powers grounds had been struck down by a divided appeals panel, which found plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to bring constitutional claims.

The panel, however, amended its opinion in late August to clarify that lawsuits alleging violations of appropriations statutes could proceed.

The dispute centers on roughly billion in foreign aid appropriated in recent years, though the immediate fight involves about $12 billion set to lapse at the end of this fiscal year.

Plaintiffs include nonprofit groups such as the Global Health Council and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, which argue that withholding the funds harms their operations and violates the law.

Ali sided with those organizations, writing that the administration's decision ""is contrary to law in violation of the APA"" and ""arbitrary and capricious"" because it provided no rationale for disregarding Congress' directives or the reliance interests of organizations that depend on the aid.

Pocket Rescission

President Donald Trump has framed the move as part of a broader effort to rein in government spending and realign U.S. foreign policy priorities.

On January 20, he issued ""Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid,"" pausing U.S. development assistance and directing agencies to review all programs.

More recently, he asked Congress to rescind $4.9 billion in funds set to expire this year, including $3.2 billion from the 2024 appropriations law.

The White House has relied on a maneuver known as a ""pocket rescission,"" under which the president proposes cuts late in the fiscal year, betting that funds could expire before lawmakers act. Russ Vought, Trump's budget director, has described the tactic as similar to a ""pocket veto.""

Critics, however, including the Government Accountability Office, members of Congress—including Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Rounds of South Dakota—say the approach effectively allows the president to exercise a line-item veto—a power the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 1998.

Likely Appeal

The Department of Justice is expected to appeal Ali's ruling and could ask the Supreme Court to intervene if it continues to lose in lower courts. The administration has argued that it requires clarity on its obligations before September deadlines for notifying Congress and negotiating agreements with foreign governments.

The stakes extend beyond the current fiscal year. If upheld, Ali's order could restrict the administration's ability to use timing strategies to withhold spending in future budget cycles.

What People Are Saying

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, in his ruling on September 3: ""This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds.""

The judge emphasized that, absent congressional action to rescind funds, the executive branch ""may not disregard a statutory mandate to spend funds simply because of policy objections,"" and he concluded: ""Defendants have given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress's appropriations must be followed.""

What Happens Next

The order blocking the Trump administration from withholding about $12 billion in foreign aid sets up an accelerated legal battle. For aid groups, the decision provides temporary relief but not certainty.

The Justice Department is expected to appeal to the D.C. Circuit and, if necessary, the Supreme Court. Because the fiscal year ends on September 30, the administration may also seek emergency relief to prevent the funds from being obligated before then.

At the same time, Trump has asked Congress to rescind $4.9 billion of the aid, including $3.2 billion from the 2024 law. If lawmakers act, those amounts would be permanently cut. If not, agencies must commit the funds quickly or risk losing them when they expire. The outcome will determine not only the fate of this year's appropriations but also the scope of presidential power over spending in the future.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2715911/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-overturned.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 13:57:44.360356

Carbajal is a leader in Congress in pushing for commonsense immigration reform and holding federal immigration enforcement officers accountable to the communities they serve.","On Friday, August 22, U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) conducted an oversight visit to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility in Santa Maria to assess conditions and convey concerns raised by constituents regarding ICE operations on the Central Coast.

During the visit, Carbajal toured the facility and engaged directly with ICE officials, raising critical questions about the well-being of the individuals detained at the facility. He inquired about access to adequate food and water, availability of legal counsel, and the process for medical evaluations. The inspection was part of the Congressman’s ongoing commitment to holding ICE officials accountable.

“Residents across the Central Coast have voiced serious concerns about ICE’s activities in our community,” said Rep. Carbajal. “As their representative in Congress, I conducted an inspection of the Santa Maria ICE facility as part of my oversight responsibilities. I met with facility officials to directly raise the issues my constituents have been calling and writing to me about. While our conversation was productive, this is by no means a ‘one-and-done’ visitation. As long as ICE continues to pursue aggressive tactics in our community, I will continue to demand answers and push for accountability to ensure that detainees are treated fairly and afforded their full constitutional rights.”

The Santa Maria ICE processing facility is where individuals taken into custody are processed for potential immigration violations. These centers handle individuals who may be subject to deportation, are awaiting immigration court proceedings, or are being held for other immigration-related reasons, such as during targeted operations.

Carbajal is a leader in Congress in pushing for commonsense immigration reform and holding federal immigration enforcement officers accountable to the communities they serve.

In June 2025, Carbajal co-sponsored the No Secret Police Act, which would require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals and to ban them from using home-made, non-tactical masks.

In July 2025, Carbajal co-led the introduction of the bipartisan Dignity Act, a bipartisan bill that would introduce reforms into our country’s immigration system. The bill includes commonsense reforms to legal status and protections for undocumented immigrants, border security investments, and improved asylum and visa processes.

In the same month, Carbajal reintroduced the Fight for the American Dream Act, legislation that allows participants of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program to serve in the United States military and provides them a pathway toward U.S. citizenship after their service.

In June 2025, Carbajal introduced the Protect Patriot Parents Act, which would make parents of U.S. military servicemembers eligible for Lawful Permanent Resident status, preventing potential deportations or separations of military families.",https://www.edhat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ice-facility-santa-maria-gmaps.png,N,,2025-09-04 13:57:28.009260

Sues Trump Administration Over Deployment of National Guard - The New York Times,"Campbell Robertson, www.nytimes.com, campbell-robertson",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/us/dc-trump-national-guard-suit.html,"The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in federal court on Thursday, challenging the president’s deployment of National Guard troops in the city.
The lawsuit by Washington comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal.
“We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.” Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.
The suit is the second the city has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.
The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police.","The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in federal court on Thursday, challenging the president’s deployment of National Guard troops in the city.

Thousands of Guard members from the city and seven states were mobilized last month as part of a sweeping federal intervention that has also brought hundreds of federal law enforcement agents to the city’s streets.

The intervention, which President Trump has said is a response to a “public safety emergency,” has prompted criticism and protests from many people in the city who say the president wants to use his power of the federal enclave to roll back the city’s limited self-governance and punish it for policies he objects to.

The lawsuit by Washington comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.”

Even as the Guard deployments have faced local pushback and legal challenges, Mr. Trump has been promising to send troops to other cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Like Washington and Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago are led by mayors who are Black and are Democrats.

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Brian Schwalb, D.C.’s attorney general, said in a statement. “We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.

But the suit argues that the deployment of the local guard for public safety reasons, and without the mayor’s consent, violated Washington’s autonomy under the 52-year-old Home Rule Act.

The suit also makes an argument similar to the one the judge in California based his ruling on: that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city runs “roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy — that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

Mr. Trump had made clear that such a role was his intention, saying on Aug. 11 that he was calling out the Guard to “reestablish law, order and public safety” in the city. Since then, even as federal law enforcement officers have been involved in hundreds of arrests and immigration agents have been detaining hundreds of Washington residents deemed to be in the country illegally, the National Guard troops have been posted at Metro stations and around city landmarks. Some soldiers have been seen picking up trash.

The suit is the second the city has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.

The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police. The city appeared likely to prevail, given the judge’s comments during the initial hearing, but that ended with the U.S. Attorney General agreeing to take a more limited role in compelling local police to cooperate on certain tasks.

Published by the Prison Policy Initiative, the report places Tennessee in the top five states for ICE arrests per capita, with the ranking even higher for arrests occurring inside jails.

“What the data shows in Tennessee is that police are arresting people—either explicitly for ICE pickup or for other offenses—and then holding them until ICE takes them into custody,” said Wanda Bertram, a spokesperson for the Prison Policy Initiative.

Knox County has seen particularly sharp increases, with the number of people held for ICE rising from six in January to nearly 50 by April.

Bertram noted that non-citizens are more likely to face jail time for minor offenses, such as driving without a license. “There are a number of ways immigrants can end up in the jail system for offenses that might be considered minor, but that authorities could treat as serious enough for ICE to intervene,” she said.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January requiring ICE to partner with local and state law enforcement, based on a determination by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Denton Mayor Gerard Hudspeth, City Manager Sara Hensley and Police Chief Jessica Robledo were at the meeting last week.

Though Hudspeth couldn’t be reached for comment, Dustin Sternbeck, the city’s chief communications officer, described the meeting as informational.

“The City has not agreed to work with or provide resources to the agency,” Sternbeck wrote in an email Wednesday. “No additional action is necessary.”

ICE contacted Hudspeth in early August to set up a meeting with city leaders to discuss the agency’s 287(g) program. It describes the program as protecting the U.S. “through the arrest and removal of aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”

Last month, Sternbeck told the Denton Record-Chronicle that any discussion that comes out of the meeting would be presented to council members.

Mayor Pro Tem Suzi Rumohr said that if Hudspeth wished “to propose anything as a result of the meeting, he would need to bring it before the City Council for discussion and a decision.”

Hudspeth did not respond to a request for comment by Wednesday evening.

Council member Brian Beck last month condemned any kind of collaboration between the city and the federal agency. Beck said a large majority of communication he’d received from community members was in opposition of current ICE tactics and behavior and supportive of the precarious situation many immigrant families — both those with legal status and those without — find themselves in.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem are ending a 2021 designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela, the agency told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

Under President Biden, two designations of TPS were established for Venezuela. The first was established in 2021, which is being terminated today, and the second in 2023, which the Trump administration terminated on April 7,2023.

""Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

""Weighing public safety, national security, migration factors, immigration policy, economic considerations, and foreign policy, it’s clear that allowing Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is not in America’s best interest,"" the spokesperson added.

With the termination of the 2021 TPS designation, 268,156 Venezuelan nationals currently in the U.S. will lose their status and will no longer be legally allowed to reside in the United States, according to figures shared by Fox News Digital from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

3,738 pending initial applications to be eligible for TPS and 102,935 pending renewal applications will also be terminated as of today.

USCIS recommends those no longer protected by TPS use the CBP Home Mobile App to facilitate leaving the U.S.

The TPS designation will expire September 10, 2025, and termination will be effective 60 days after the publication of the Federal Register notice.

After the April termination of the 2023 TPS designation, roughly 348,000 Venezuelan nationals lost their protected status and were required to make arrangements to leave the U.S.

“This whole situation, this whole ordeal, has been a political attack against me since the day I went to Delaney Hall,” she said.

McIver said she hasn’t spoken with the defectors personally, but she did send notes of thanks.","In the long history of the U.S. House of Representatives, only 28 members have been formally censured by a full vote of the House. Today, Republicans tried to make Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark) into the 29th – and they failed.

A resolution supported by most House Republicans would have censured McIver for her conduct during a scuffle last spring at a Newark immigrant detention center, and removed her from her seat on the House Homeland Security Committee. But unexpectedly, a Democratic effort to kill the resolution succeeded, with five Republican House members voting in support of a motion to table and two voting “present.”

(Every present Democrat supported the motion to table, which passed 215-207; one of the Republicans who voted “yes” later said that was a mistake, but it was too late to change his vote.)

The outcome means that the resolution, spearheaded by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, won’t even come up for a proper vote at all, and McIver will remain uncensured and a member of all of her committees.

McIver said that the outcome came as something of a surprise to her, and that she will remain just as defiantly opposed to the immigration policies put forward by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans as she always has been.

“This whole situation, this whole ordeal, has been a political attack against me since the day I went to Delaney Hall,” she said. “I continue to be a critic of this administration, and I think they just want to find different ways to bully me and intimidate me while I’m here. I’m not going to back down.”

The Newark congresswoman, first elected just last year, became a Republican target after a May 9 incident at the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center, at which McIver and two of her House colleagues were conducting an oversight visit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who had attempted to accompany the three congressmembers on the visit, was arrested for trespassing, setting off a brief scuffle involving McIver, federal immigration officers, and a group of assembled protesters.

The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, but New Jersey’s controversial federal prosecutor, Alina Habba, instead charged McIver with assault, and later obtained an indictment from a grand jury. A trial has been set for November, but McIver has said the charges are politically motivated and asked a federal judge to dismiss the indictment.

Republicans in Congress, however, didn’t wait for the legal battle to come to a resolution before moving ahead with an effort to reprimand McIver. The resolution stated that McIver’s actions at Delaney Hall “do not reflect creditably on the House” and that her continued presence on the Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigrant detention facilities like Delaney Hall, “would represent a significant conflict of interest.”

“Censure is appropriate, and historically is well in line with what has happened,” Higgins said at a Homeland Security Committee meeting in June. “Generally, by this point, a member removes themselves from their committee involvement, certainly from a committee that has direct oversight in the arena wherein the charges are to be prosecuted.”

That was a viewpoint shared even by McIver’s three Republican colleagues in New Jersey, one of whom, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis), chaired a subcommittee hearing in May that partially focused on criticizing McIver. “If you look at the video, she was pushing and shoving and physically involved, and that’s not acceptable,” Van Drew said prior to today’s vote.

Some congressional Republicans had floated even more extreme punishments such as expelling McIver from the House, but that was never a realistic possibility given that expulsion requires a two-thirds majority and Democrats – including, critically, House Democratic leadership – were staunchly opposed to any effort to punish her.

And they were joined, unexpectedly, by a small cohort of Republicans who said that they wanted to let other processes play out before resorting to censuring McIver and removing her from a committee; “I think it’s best to let Ethics Committee finish its report,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) told Politico. McIver said she hasn’t spoken with the defectors personally, but she did send notes of thanks.

“I do want to thank those Republicans that sided with us to see that this was wrong, and this should be a matter of [the Ethics Committee] and letting this case play out,” she said.

The Human Rights Coordinator for Barnstable County says there has been a growing number of inquiries related to immigration and national origin received by the Barnstable County Human Rights Advisory Commission.

As of July 1st, 24-percent of the Commission’s intakes involve immigrants, up from about ten percent in the past two years.

According to the report, many of the cases involve public harassment.

Common themes include fear surrounding immigration enforcement activity, reports of aggressive enforcement tactics, family separation, and stress caused by shifts in Temporary Protected Status.

“We continue to hear from families who are anxious about enforcement activity and changes in immigration status. These fears affect daily life — from parents worried about going to work to students uncertain about attending school,” said Leslie Dominguez-Santos, Human Rights Coordinator for Barnstable County.

Illegal immigration enforcement has been a top priority for the second Trump Administration. An ICE operation in May resulted in about 1,500 immigrants taken into custody across Massachusetts, including on Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard.

On the Cape, there was particular community concern this summer in Falmouth, prompting their Select Board to release this statement on July 1st:

The Town of Falmouth is committed to enabling our residents, businesses, employees, and visitors the opportunity to live, work, and experience our town’s unique charm today, tomorrow, and for future generations. We strive to be an inclusive, welcoming, equitable, and diverse community, and we take seriously our responsibilities for economic prosperity and the health, safety, and wellbeing of residents and visitors.

Trust, including trust that constitutional and civil rights will be upheld by all law enforcement officials, is foundational to the kind of community we strive to be. Our local police work diligently to build trust and relationships – acting as guardians first, enforcers only when necessary.

In contrast, some of the tactics employed by federal immigration and law enforcement officials operating in Falmouth in recent weeks has contributed to a climate of fear that undermines the work that our town staff, including our police department, do each day.",https://www.capecod.com/wp-content/uploads/NWS_County-Seal_BF012423.png,N,,2025-09-04 11:58:45.696405

In a 7-4 vote, the federal circuit court cited all three arguments in ruling Trump had exceeded his legal authority.
The appellate judges put their decision on hold until the Supreme Court rules.","President Trump has asked the Supreme Court for a fast-track ruling that he has broad power acting on his own to impose tariffs on products coming from countries around the world.

Despite losing in the lower courts, Trump and his lawyers have reason to believe they can win in the Supreme Court. The six conservative justices believe in strong presidential power, particularly in the area of foreign policy and national security.

In a three-page appeal filed Wednesday evening, they proposed the court decide by next Wednesday to grant review and to hear arguments in early November.

They said the lower court setbacks, unless quickly reversed, “gravely undermine the President’s ability to conduct real-world diplomacy and his ability to protect the national security and economy of the United States.”

They cited Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s warning about the potential for economic disruption if the court does not act soon.

“Delaying a ruling until June 26 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion have already been collected and unwinding them could cause significant disruption,” he wrote.

Trump and his tariffs ran into three strong arguments in the lower courts.

First, the Constitution says Congress, not the president, has the power “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” and a tariff is an import tax.

Second, the 1977 emergency powers law that Trump relies on does not mention tariffs, taxes or duties, and no previous president has used it to impose tariffs.

And third, the Supreme Court has frowned on recent presidents who relied on old laws to justify bold, new, costly regulations.

So far, however, the so-called “major questions” doctrine has been used to restrict Democratic presidents, not Republicans.

Three years ago, the court’s conservative majority struck down a major climate change regulation proposed by Presidents Obama and Biden that could have transformed the electric power industry on the grounds it was not clearly based on the Clean Air Act of the 1970s.

Two years ago, the court in the same 6-3 vote struck down Biden’s plan to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans. Congress had said the Education Department may “waive or modify” monthly loan payments during a national emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not say the loans may be forgiven, the court said. Its opinion noted the “staggering” cost could be more than $500 billion.

The impact of Trump’s tariffs figures to be at least five times greater, a federal appeals court said last week in ruling them illegal.

In a 7-4 vote, the federal circuit court cited all three arguments in ruling Trump had exceeded his legal authority.

“We conclude Congress, in enacting the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not give the president wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs,” they said.

But the outcome was not a total loss for Trump. The appellate judges put their decision on hold until the Supreme Court rules. That means Trump’s tariffs are likely to remain in effect for many months.

Trump’s lawyers were heartened by the dissent written by Judge Richard Taranto and joined by three others.

He argued that presidents are understood to have extra power when confronted with foreign threats to the nation’s security.

Taranto called the 1977 law “an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm” that said the president may “regulate” the “importation” of dangerous products including drugs coming into this country.

Citing other laws from that era, he said Congress understood that tariffs and duties are a “common tool of import regulation.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/784d34a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4953x2600+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2Fa4%2F52db667641ccbfcecb3d8a35d406%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2208185431,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:45.124215

Final Thought This tragic episode reminds us of the vital role immigration attorneys play in defending constitutional rights, even beyond U.S. borders.","In a development that has ignited global scrutiny and domestic legal controversy, the Trump administration recently authorized a U.S. military strike that killed 11 individuals aboard a speedboat in the Caribbean Sea, allegedly tied to Venezuela’s “criminal underworld”. The administration claims the boat was a “narco-terrorist” vessel operating under the umbrella of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the United States designated a terrorist organization earlier this year (Reuters, 9/3/25).

President Trump shared video footage of the strike on his social platform Truth Social, calling it “an incredible win” for national security. But legal experts and immigration advocates are raising serious concerns: not only about the facts of the case but about the precedent this strike sets for the use of lethal force in non-combat, non-judicial international scenarios.

Extrajudicial or Justified? Legal Analysis of the Caribbean Strike

While the Trump administration insists the strike was part of an expanded anti-narcotics campaign, seasoned analysts argue the operation may have violated both U.S. and international law.

According to Reuters, international maritime law allows for the interdiction of vessels suspected of drug trafficking, but lethal force is reserved only for self-defense or under formal wartime engagement. None of the facts released by the administration demonstrate that the 11 passengers posed an imminent threat to U.S. forces or civilians.

“It is unclear whether there was even a lawful basis for targeting these individuals,” said a former senior official at the Department of Justice. “This wasn’t a battlefield. This was open water. Drug smuggling—however serious—is not justification for a drone strike without judicial oversight.”

The U.N. Charter and Law of the Sea Convention, to which the U.S. is a signatory in principle, emphasize due process and the right to life—even in cases involving suspected criminal conduct on the high seas.

Were They Smugglers, or Migrants?

Adding to the confusion is the tactical implausibility of the administration’s account. Why, legal analysts ask, would 11 people be required aboard a speedboat transporting narcotics? Most drug operations rely on minimal crews to limit exposure and cost. The presence of such a large number of individuals suggests a different possibility: that the vessel may have been carrying migrants, not drugs.

“From a migration law perspective, 11 people on a small vessel is consistent with human smuggling, not narcotics,” said Brad Bernstein from Spar & Bernstein. “We’ve represented countless clients who’ve taken similar risks in hopes of reaching safety and reunifying with family. Those individuals deserved arrest, screening, and legal process, not death.”

The lack of confirmed evidence, the absence of verified contraband, and the absence of survivors to testify raise the specter of a politically motivated strike, intended more for show than substance. Even the authenticity of the video Trump shared is being questioned by news analysts, though Reuters has yet to verify any manipulation.

Expanding Executive Power Without Oversight

This event highlights the growing trend of executive overreach in the name of national security, particularly where immigration enforcement intersects with the use of military force.

The Trump administration has previously broadened the legal definition of “enemy combatant” to include drug cartels and smuggling organizations, creating a legal gray zone where constitutional protections are suspended. Legal scholars warn this could open the door to further unilateral military action against civilians, without oversight or accountability.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the strike, saying the U.S. could have interdicted the boat, but chose a “deterrent” approach instead. While the desire to combat transnational crime is understandable, the failure to follow arrest and prosecution procedures should alarm every legal professional and every American.

Human Rights, Immigration, and the Role of Attorneys

For immigration lawyers at Spar & Bernstein, this strike is part of a troubling shift toward the criminalization and militarization of migration. Increasingly, we see undocumented individuals—many of whom are longtime residents, parents, and contributors to our communities—being cast as criminals or terrorists.

“Whether these 11 people were migrants, asylum seekers, or wrongfully accused, they deserved due process,” says Brad. “We are here to protect the rights of the undocumented and to ensure that no one is punished without evidence, without trial, and without justice.”

If your loved one is missing, detained abroad, or possibly affected by this strike or similar military action, our office is prepared to investigate, advocate, and provide legal relief where possible. We have decades of experience litigating complex immigration and humanitarian cases—and we stand firm in the belief that the law must serve people, not politics.

Final Thought

This tragic episode reminds us of the vital role immigration attorneys play in defending constitutional rights, even beyond U.S. borders. While the political rhetoric may be harsh and the military power vast, the law remains clear: due process is not optional. It’s essential.

For those with questions about family members missing at sea, under deportation review, or affected by recent changes to immigration enforcement protocols, we encourage you to contact the attorneys at Spar & Bernstein today.

The letter urges the ACHPR to intervene by issuing a formal resolution in response to the United States of America’s unlawful transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to third countries in Africa. This was done under secretive bilateral agreements and without regard for any claims they may have to protection under refugee and human rights treaties. At least 20 migrants have already been transferred to South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda, and Uganda has recently signed an agreement with the United States to begin accepting more migrants expelled from the U.S. imminently.

Bella Mosselmans, Director of the Council said:

“These illegal transfers violate international and African human rights law and expose forcibly expelled migrants to arbitrary detention and serious abuses of human rights. The United States cannot outsource its obligations under international law, and African governments should resist complicity in these unlawful practices.”

As more agreements are reportedly being negotiated, the Council welcomes the latest press release from the ACHPR strongly calling for transparency of any agreements made with the United States and humane migration policies based in dignity, solidarity and justice.

The Council and its partners are now calling on the Commission to issue a resolution that firmly protects and upholds the rights of migrants and asylum seekers subject to U.S. agreements with African countries, and urges African Union member states not to enter into similar, new agreements that facilitate the unlawful expulsion of refugees and migrants from the United States of America.

Anwen Hughes, Senior Director of Legal Strategy, Refugee Programs at Human Rights First said:

“The Commission’s recent statement is a vital step, but we urge them to go further at this critical moment. With potentially hundreds more migrants expected to be transferred to the region under unlawful U.S. agreements, it is more important than ever for civil society, human rights authorities and states around the world to make clear that adherence to human rights law and due process is a legal imperative and essential to the rule of law globally.

First, states should adopt a precautionary approach by carrying out comprehensive human rights risk assessments, developing adequate risk mitigation strategies before engaging in external co-operation, and reviewing ongoing activities for their human rights impact.
This is crucial for their policies to be in line with their legal obligations to uphold human rights at home and internationally.”","Michael O’Flaherty made the remarks today as he published a new report, entitled Externalised asylum and migration policies and human rights law, which highlights the challenges that come with such arrangements.

In the absence of adequate human rights preconditions and safeguards, externalisation policies might result in people being subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, collective expulsions and arbitrary detention or may put their lives in danger, it stresses.

Such policies might also hinder effective access to asylum and deprive individuals of legal remedies.

Mr O’Flaherty said: “External co-operation on asylum and migration needs to be designed and implemented with great care, so as not to put human rights at risk.

“Governments developing externalisation policies in this field should carefully assess their potential negative impact on human rights, as such policies can expose women, men and children to significant risks of serious harm and protracted suffering.”

Today’s report identifies three areas in which risks are particularly acute: external processing of asylum claims; external return procedures, including through so-called “return hubs”; and the outsourcing of border control to other countries, some of which have a documented history of serious violations against people on the move.

In view of the human rights challenges that these measures may entail, the commissioner makes four main recommendations to Council of Europe member states, acting individually or collectively, including in the context of membership of the EU.

First, states should adopt a precautionary approach by carrying out comprehensive human rights risk assessments, developing adequate risk mitigation strategies before engaging in external co-operation, and reviewing ongoing activities for their human rights impact.

Second, they should define clear and non-negotiable principles that exclude any cooperation likely to put people at risk of human rights violations, and ensure that children and other vulnerable people are never subjected to externalised procedures.

Third, they should ensure adequate human rights preconditions and safeguards, adapted to each model of co-operation, including preventing the shifting of responsibility to other countries, ensuring no one is transferred to a partner country without a rigorous individual assessment, and limiting any use of return hubs to specific, clearly defined situations.

Fourth, they should strengthen transparency, monitoring and accountability, through robust agreements, transparent information-sharing, independent monitoring, and effective investigations of any alleged violations.

“As European states continue to pursue externalisation, the impact on the human rights and dignity of people on the move must not be overlooked,” Mr O’Flaherty said.

“Member states should assess the risks involved, commit to strong legal guarantees, and ensure scrutiny of their actions. This is crucial for their policies to be in line with their legal obligations to uphold human rights at home and internationally.”",https://www.irishlegal.com/storage/dc6f5fe539924c97331c0bc8cc20761b0e498ada.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:42.815787

According to mentors and friends of Salazar, he is an advocate of human rights and frequently works with nonprofits.

“He's someone that I look up to,” Martinez said. “Just in his tenacity of always being so resilient.”

Martinez said Salazar is also an entrepreneur in the Artificial Intelligence space.

“He focuses on connecting or putting together data regarding human rights, translating to make sure that we can all understand what the data is speaking about, but building it up through artificial intelligence,” Martinez said. “Whether it's corporate America or nonprofit, he figures out programs to make better decisions for the community.”

According to Salazar's attorneys, Jacob Monty and Veronica Franco Salazar with Monty & Ramirez LLP, Salazar was born in Mexico and brought to the United States in 2008.

""He didn't choose to come here. He came here as an 11-year-old brought by his parents,"" Monty said. ""He didn't choose to cross the border. His parents brought him.""

According to Monty, Salazar focused on his studies and went on to graduate as valedictorian of Trinidad Garza Early College and later SMU.

SMU confirmed Salazar received a Bachelor of Science in Sociology and a Bachelor of Arts in Human Rights on May 18, 2019.

“We're talking about someone that has never had any criminal interaction, no criminal history,” Monty said. “He’s just a contributing member of the Texas society. And he is facing removal from Texas to a country he does not know.”

While attorneys said Salazar does not have a criminal record, they're concerned about the new limitations on immigration bonds announced on July 8.

“Omar might be subject to mandatory detention, meaning that the courts wouldn't even have the jurisdiction to review his case and review if he's eligible for bond,” Franco Salazar said.

“It's not just a theoretical concern. We're seeing DHS take this very same position with cases after July 8. So, our worry is rooted in recent practice that we've seen DHS employ, saying that aliens like Omar are not eligible for bond,” Monty said. “We disagree with that, and we have some legal arguments to show that. We think we're going to be able to show the judge that he is eligible for bond.”

The firm said they have taken up the case pro bono and the money raised by friends and family will be used to cover the bail and any expenses associated with the detention, including psychological support.

“We are worried about that because having to fight this case and be detained for a year is a tremendous amount of suffering, a tremendous hardship that causes many immigrants to just self-deport,” Monty said. “Omar's not going to self-deport and we're going to fight this and get some common sense to prevail on this issue.”

Analysis revealed frequent misreporting of immigration tribunal cases, as well as mischaracterisations of the UK’s system of immigration appeals and the role played by the ECHR in this context. The report aims to support informed public debate by identifying and addressing misconceptions.

Politicians, journalists and commentators may legitimately hold different views on immigration and human rights. But mischaracterising how the law operates does a disservice to the public. Evidence should be the foundation of any debate, whatever view one takes on the policy questions.

Professor Başak Çalı, Bonavero Institute of Human Rights

Co-written by Victoria Adelmant, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford and Resident at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, Professor Alice Donald of Middlesex University London, and Professor Başak Çalı of the Bonavero Institute, the study involved a systematic review of media reports that mentioned the ECHR between 1 January and 30 June 2025, analysing 379 news stories and opinion pieces.

Around 75% of these media reports focused on the ECHR’s role in immigration control – particularly appeals by foreign national offenders against deportation orders.

The report finds that immigration tribunal cases are frequently misreported. It highlights several high-profile examples of misleading coverage, including the so-called ‘chicken nuggets’ case – widely reported as the prevention of an individual’s deportation on the basis of his child’s dislike of foreign food, despite the decision not being based on this detail and having already been overturned. These misrepresentations, the authors argue, risk eroding public confidence in the legal system and are fuelling calls to leave the ECHR based on misleading portrayals of the role and operation of the ECHR in the UK.

Professor Donald said: 'Our findings show that much of the public discussion about the ECHR and immigration is not grounded in accurate reporting. For a debate of such importance, it is essential that arguments are based on evidence and a correct understanding of the law. Without this, public trust in the rule of law is placed at risk.'

Since 1980, the European Court of Human Rights has found against the UK in only 13 removal cases, and just four of those concerned family life. In relation to immigration rules more broadly, the Court has only three times ruled that the UK’s immigration rules violate the ECHR in the past 45 years.

Despite political and media focus on cases involving foreign national offenders, the report highlights that successful human rights-based appeals against deportation are rare. The latest available Home Office data on human rights-based appeals against deportation shows that in the 15 months to June 2021, the number of successful appeals amounted to only 0.73% of the total number of sentenced foreign national offenders.

Over a five-year period to June 2021, the number of successful human rights-based deportation appeals represented about 3.5% of the total number of deportations – and around 2.5% when looking at appeals based solely on private and family life grounds. These figures may be overestimates as they do not account for cases subsequently overturned by the Upper Tribunal.

Victoria Adelmant, Resident at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, said: 'The absence of systematically published Home Office data on human rights-based appeals against deportation makes it difficult to have a fully informed discussion on this topic. The Home Office has itself recently stated that its data surrounding foreign national offenders is not sufficiently robust. More regular and accessible publication of statistics and disaggregated information would enable more evidence-based public debate.'

The report clarifies that the ECHR does not grant non-citizens a right to live in the UK, and that states are free to set their own immigration policies. In deportation cases, two provisions of the Convention are typically invoked: Article 3 (prohibition of torture or inhuman treatment) or Article 8 (protection of private and family life).

The report shows that reliance on Article 8 in appeals against deportation gained significant attention in media coverage in the first half of 2025. But the possibility of claiming the right to protection of private and family life to prevent deportation is heavily restricted by legislation passed by Parliament. Under UK immigration law, deportation orders are mandatory for foreign national offenders sentenced to 12 months or more in prison, and exceptions apply only in very limited circumstances.

The report also demonstrates that judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK are very rare, and that the Court has only rarely held that the UK government has violated human rights in its immigration-related decisions and policies.

Since 1980, the European Court of Human Rights has found against the UK in only 13 removal cases, and just four of those concerned family life. In relation to immigration rules more broadly, the Court has only three times ruled that the UK’s immigration rules violate the ECHR in the past 45 years.

Suggestions that the European Court of Human Rights ‘hinders’ the UK’s efforts to control immigration, the authors note, do not stand up to scrutiny.

Suggestions that the European Court of Human Rights ‘hinders’ the UK’s efforts to control immigration, the authors note, do not stand up to scrutiny.

The report warns that misconceptions about tribunal cases, the UK’s appeals system and the ECHR have real consequences: sensational coverage can fuel hostility towards migrants and human rights law, and, as senior judges have noted, can even put the safety of members of the judiciary at risk. The authors argue that responsible reporting, combined with better data, is vital for sustaining democratic debate on immigration policy.

Professor Çalı said: 'Politicians, journalists and commentators may legitimately hold different views on immigration and human rights.

Some Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, weren't covered by the appeals court ruling.

The government called on the court to reverse an appeals court ruling that found most of President Donald Trump's tariffs are an illegal use of an emergency powers law.

It's the latest in a series of Trump administration appeals to a Supreme Court he helped shape, and one that is expected to put a centerpiece of the president's trade policy before the justices.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left the tariffs in place for now, but the administration nevertheless called on the high court to intervene quickly in a petition filed electronically late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press. It was expected to be formally docketed on Thursday.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to take up the case and hear arguments in early November.

""That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,"" he wrote. ""The stakes in this case could not be higher.""

But the stakes are also high for small businesses battered by tariffs and uncertainty, said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.

""These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,"" he said.

The businesses have twice prevailed, once at a federal court focused on trade and again with the appeals court's 7-4 ruling.

Their lawsuit is one of several challenging the tariffs and erratic rollout that have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.

But Trump has also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.

Most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, did not let Trump usurp congressional power to set tariffs. The dissenters, though, said the law does allow the president to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations.

The ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

Some Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, weren't covered by the appeals court ruling. It also does not include tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.

Trump can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act.

The government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2b%2F86%2Fc29f4b5c436eb987b5e13b7c1484%2Fap25246583232253.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 11:59:13.497611

'City of the Big Shoulders' will stand strong against Trump So we’ll wait for Trump’s invasion.","CHICAGO — We here in this ""City of the Big Shoulders,"" this diverse, beautiful, complicated Midwestern metropolis, are preparing for a likely Donald Trump-ordered invasion of federal immigration agents, and possibly federal troops.

Yes, I used the word “invasion,” as it seems accurate. Nobody here wants them, not Chicago’s mayor, not the governor, not the people, not the advocacy groups that help immigrants or work to stop violence. If the feds or the soldiers come, they’ll be uninvited and unwelcome, and the pointlessness of their mission will be clear as a sunny late-summer day on the shore of Lake Michigan.

Folks in my adopted city don’t suffer fools lightly, and Trump is a fool who thinks he can flex his authoritarian muscles by sending troops onto the streets of Democratic-led cities. He is itching for chaos.

'They want to inflame something' – that's why Trump's targeting Chicago

As Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said recently of the rumored Trump administration plans to do in Chicago what they’ve already messily and dumbly done in Los Angeles and Washington, DC: “The intentions here are clear. Nothing to do with actually enforcing the law, nothing to do with actually keeping the peace. They want to inflame something. That is what they want.”

Like all good aspiring dictators, Trump knows if he kicks off trouble with his masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement goons or draws mass protests by militarizing the streets of a major city, it’ll give him an excuse to exert more federal power.

It’s not clever, it’s just the obvious play for a man who sees our democracy as an obstacle.

Trump keeps lying about violent crime as ICE goes after families

For whatever they’re worth in these days of Trumpian dishonesty, the facts are against the president in all regards. He can talk about ICE agents rounding up hardened criminals, but according to the most recent ICE data, 70% of those presently in ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody have no felony conviction.

Trump and his administration toadies can talk about “violent crime in big cities,” but crime in Chicago is down sharply, with a 32% drop in homicides and a nearly 40% drop in shootings.

If they come into my city, it will be for the noise and spectacle of it all, for the sole purpose of manipulating the masses with unfounded fear, not for any valiant reason or with the goal of making anyone’s life better.

Chicago cops won't help ICE, and they won't wear masks either

Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order that Chicago police ""will not cooperate with or enable any unlawful or unconstitutional actions undertaken by federal law enforcement.""

And you can bet the activists, faith leaders and concerned residents of Chicago will be organized and ready to peacefully place wrenches in the gears of Trump’s intimidation machine.

WBEZ Chicago recently quoted the Rev. Tyrone McGowan of Progressive Community Church on the city’s South Side: “We are rising, rising not because of soldiers and military occupation, but because of neighbors and organizers, health care professionals, educators, pastors and parents, young people and elders who decide to choose peace.”

Chicago's history of protest awaits Trump's federal invasion

Chicago has a long history of protest. In the 19th century, German and Irish immigrants were being blamed for crime – sound familiar? – and the city’s mayor targeted German saloon owners, leading German immigrants to rise up and clash with police on the Clark Street Bridge over the Chicago River.

The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago led to days of riots involving police, soldiers and throngs of Vietnam War protesters.

In 2006, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Chicago to protest anti-immigration policies, and earlier this year, tens of thousands gathered downtown in Daley Plaza to rail against the Trump administration as part of the nationwide No Kings protest.

Simply put, Chicagoans know how to protest. The city has a massive network of well-organized activist groups and a baked-in intolerance for getting pushed around. People here look out for their neighbors, and they know a con artist like Trump when they see one.

The myth of Chicago as a violent hellscape is red meat for Trump's base

The president and his Republican Party have used Chicago as a culture-war cudgel for years on end, painting this city – my city – as some violent hellhole, statistics and objective reality be damned. We have problems, as do all cities and towns. Ours can seem worse, a multiplicative factor that comes with life in a place of 2.7 million people.

But among cities with a population of more than 100,000, Chicago isn’t even near the top 10 in violent crime per capita.

So Trump should take his fearmongering and false narratives and excuses to sic U.S. troops on U.S. citizens and use them somewhere really violent, like Little Rock, Arkansas, which is No. 4 on the most violent cities list.

'City of the Big Shoulders' will stand strong against Trump

So we’ll wait for Trump’s invasion. But let it be known loud and clear that this isn’t a city you mess with. This is the place that saw regular pizza and said, “Hey, what if we make that about 2 inches deeper and put more cheese on it?”

This is a place of hard work. A place where resistance runs deep.

The poet Carl Sandburg, in 1914, dubbed us “City of the Big Shoulders” and wrote, aptly, “I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them: Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.”

While the Supreme Court wrestles internally with some of the criticism, lower court judges are increasingly focused on their own safety.","WASHINGTON — Federal judges are frustrated with the Supreme Court for increasingly overturning lower court rulings involving the Trump administration with little or no explanation, with some worried the practice is undermining the judiciary at a sensitive time.

Some judges believe the Supreme Court, and in particular Chief Justice John Roberts, could be doing more to defend the integrity of their work as President Donald Trump and his allies harshly criticize those who rule against him and as violent threats against judges are on the rise.

In rare interviews with NBC News, a dozen federal judges — appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, including Trump, and serving around the country — pointed to a pattern they say has recently emerged:

Lower court judges are handed contentious cases involving the Trump administration. They painstakingly research the law to reach their rulings. When they go against Trump, administration officials and allies criticize the judges in harsh terms. The government appeals to the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority.

And then the Supreme Court, in emergency rulings, swiftly rejects the judges’ decisions with little to no explanation.

Emergency rulings used to be rare. But their number has dramatically increased in recent years.

Ten of the 12 judges who spoke to NBC News said the Supreme Court should better explain those rulings, noting that the terse decisions leave lower court judges with little guidance for how to proceed. But they also have a new and concerning effect, the judges said, validating the Trump administration’s criticisms. A short rebuttal from the Supreme Court, they argue, makes it seem like they did shoddy work and are biased against Trump.

“It is inexcusable,” a judge said of the Supreme Court justices. “They don’t have our backs.”

All 12 judges spoke on condition that they not be identifiable, some because it is considered unwise to publicly criticize the justices who ultimately decide whether to uphold their rulings and others because of the risk of threats.

Judges are increasingly targeted, with some facing bomb threats, “swattings” and other harassment. Judges especially involved in high-profile cases — and their families — have reported receiving violent threats.

As of June, the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects judges, had reported more than 400 threat investigations this year. There has been a steady rise of such threats in recent years, from 224 in fiscal year 2021 to 457 in fiscal year 2023, according to congressional testimony given by the Marshals Service. An agency spokesman declined to provide updated numbers.

When judges issue rulings the Trump administration does not like, they are frequently targeted by influential figures in MAGA world and sometimes Trump himself, who called for a judge who ruled against him in a high-profile immigration case to be impeached. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has said the administration is the victim of a “judicial coup.”

The judge who said the Supreme Court justices are behaving inexcusably has received threats of violence and is now fearful when someone knocks on the door at home.

If major efforts are not made to address the situation, the judge said, “somebody is going to die.”

With tensions so high, four of the judges said they believe the Supreme Court and specifically Roberts, the head of the judiciary, should do more to defend the courts.

The Supreme Court, a second judge said, is effectively assisting the Trump administration in “undermining the lower courts,” leaving district and appeals court judges “thrown under the bus.”

The Supreme Court has an obligation to explain rulings in a way the public can understand, a third judge said, adding that when the court so frequently rules for the administration in emergency cases without fully telling people why, it sends a signal. The court has had strong left-leaning majorities in the past, but what is different now is the role emergency cases are playing in public discourse.

The Supreme Court, that judge said, is effectively endorsing Miller’s claims that the judiciary is trying to subvert the presidency.

“It’s almost like the Supreme Court is saying it is a ‘judicial coup,’” the judge said.

Not all judges who were interviewed shared that view. Some were more reluctant to criticize the justices.

A judge appointed by President Barack Obama said that while the Supreme Court could do more to explain itself, some lower court judges had been out of line in blocking Trump policies.

“Certainly, there is a strong sense in the judiciary among the judges ruling on these cases that the court is leaving them out to dry,” he said. “They are partially right to feel the way they feel.”

But, the judge added, “the whole ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ is a real issue. As a result, judges are mad at what Trump is doing or the manner he is going about things; they are sometimes forgetting to stay in their lane.”

The 'shadow docket'

In 2015, a University of Chicago Law School professor came up with a catchy term for a hitherto obscure part of the Supreme Court’s docket, in which cases are fast-tracked outside the court’s normally monthslong appeals process: the “shadow docket.”

Those are emergency cases handled much more quickly than normal — there are rarely oral arguments, and decisions can come within days with little or no explanation, while argued cases always include some reasoning that varies from a handful of pages to dozens to, in rare cases, the length of a short book.

The shadow docket has exploded in recent years, with the first Trump administration turbo-charging the trend by rushing to the Supreme Court when lower court rulings blocked nationwide policies. An early example was Trump’s travel ban on people entering the United States from mostly Muslim-majority countries, which the Supreme Court allowed to partly go into effect in June 2017.

Before the recent surge, most emergency cases involved death row inmates’ attempts to block their executions at the eleventh hour, and the court would normally handle them via terse orders with no explanation. But the increase in cases in hot-button nationwide disputes, sparked in part by presidents of both parties relying more on executive orders than passing legislation via Congress, has put greater scrutiny on the court’s reasoning.

The growing reliance on the shadow docket has drawn criticism from legal experts about the lack of time and process the Supreme Court spends on what can be incredibly consequential decisions.

Since Trump took office again in January, his administration has asked the Supreme Court 23 times to block lower court rules on an emergency basis.

The court has granted the government’s emergency requests in 17. It rejected the government in two cases, while three other cases were resolved without decisions, and one request is pending.

Notable victories include rulings that curbed lower-court injunctions that had blocked his contentious plan to end automatic birthright citizenship and his efforts to fire federal workers. The Supreme Court has also overturned lower court rulings that would have hindered Trump’s tough immigration policies. It has, though, pushed back against the administration in two other high-profile immigration cases.

By comparison, the Biden administration filed 19 applications during its entire four-year term, with the court granting its requests 10 times, according to Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown Law professor who has written a book about the subject.

An NBC News review of the Trump decisions showed that five of the 17 cases overturning lower court rulings included no substantive reasoning at all. Seven of the others included less than three pages of explanation. That critique extends back to the Biden administration, when the court failed to explain its decisions in eight out of the 10 wins for the government.

“Judges in the trenches need, and deserve, well-reasoned, bright-line guidance,” a judge said. “Too often today, sweeping rulings arrive with breathtaking speed but minimal explanation, stripped of the rigor that full briefing and argument provide.”

Ten of the judges, both Republican and Democratic appointees, agreed the court’s lack of explanation is a problem. Judges must follow Supreme Court precedent, but they can find it difficult to assess what the justices are asking them to do.

That was the situation in which Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox found himself this year after Trump fired three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Like certain other federal agencies, it was set up by Congress to be insulated from political pressures. While the president could nominate members to fixed terms, he could not fire them except for “neglect of duty or malfeasance.”

On paper, Maddox’s job was an easy one: As a district court judge, he has to follow the Supreme Court’s previous rulings. In 1935, in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld a law preventing the president from firing members of the Federal Trade Commission — a setup similar to the CPSC’s — without cause.

The Supreme Court’s current conservative majority has undermined that precedent in recent years, but, crucially, it has not overturned it.

But before Maddox issued his decision, the Supreme Court on May 22 allowed Trump to fire members of two other independent agencies with similar restrictions, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.

The Supreme Court’s two-page order was paltry, sending mixed messages by allowing the firings while expressly saying the court would wait to decide whether to overturn Humphrey’s Executor.

Maddox was left to grapple with how that decision applied to his case. He ultimately rejected the Trump administration’s arguments in two separate rulings in June, concluding that he was bound by the 1935 precedent.

“Humphrey’s Executor remains good law,” he wrote.

But Maddox did not have the final word. The Trump administration once again quickly turned to the Supreme Court, which granted its emergency request to allow the firings a month later.

The case was “squarely controlled” by its May decision, the conservative majority said in a one-page decision overturning Maddox.

In both cases, the court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing in the second one that the majority had “all but overturned” Humphrey’s Executor despite never having heard arguments or issued a full ruling on the underlying legal question.

Kagan spoke about the difficulties lower court judges face in such cases at a legal conference in Monterey, California, this summer.

She referred to a different case in which Massachusetts-based Judge Myong Joun issued a ruling that blocked Trump administration plans to downsize the Education Department. The administration quickly appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the government.

Kagan noted that the case raised several legal issues, including what authority Joun had to step in, but the Supreme Court’s terse order did not explain on what grounds it was blocking his decision. The only writing was from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned an 18-page dissent.

“What’s that court supposed to think?” Kagan asked, referring to Joun. “It’s just impossible to know, and that puts the [lower] court in a very difficult situation.”

But there is no unanimity within the Supreme Court about that issue. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion last month when the court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in another emergency case that was scathing about what he perceived as lower court judges’ failure to follow the Supreme Court’s orders.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” he wrote.

A judge who spoke to NBC News expressed frustration that judges’ role in the judicial system is being undermined by the Supreme Court’s frequent interventions, before there has been extensive litigation and, potentially, a trial.

“It’s very discouraging,” the judge said. “We are operating in a bit of a vacuum.”

While agreeing that “it would be nicer” if the court gave fuller explanations in emergency decisions, another judge said it is too early to really cast judgment on how the Supreme Court has responded to the Trump administration, with litigation still ongoing in most cases.

It is up to the Supreme Court whether it wants to issue detailed decisions in emergency cases, the judge added, calling it “entirely a matter of grace.”

Lower court judges know that being overturned by the Supreme Court is part of the job, but the judge who said the justices have an obligation to explain themselves added that they can disagree with a lower court’s legal reasoning while also defending it as a good-faith attempt to address complex legal issues.

The judge suggested the Supreme Court should say, “Let’s be clear, it’s not some crazy opinion, and this judge is not a monster.”

Head of the judiciary

As chief justice, Roberts has a dual role. As well as being one of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, he is head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, the administrative arm of the courts, where he represents the interests of the judiciary as a whole.

Four judges who spoke to NBC News think Roberts, a conservative about to mark 20 years in the position, could do more to speak out when Trump allies complain about judicial overreach.

Roberts did issue a rare statement in March pushing back against Trump’s call to impeach the judge who ruled against the administration in the major immigration case.

“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said.

He also defended the judiciary in his annual end-of-year statement in December, in which he referred to an increase in threats to judges in recent years and called out “illegitimate activity” that seeks to undermine the judiciary.

But the judge who said the Supreme Court's frequent interventions are discouraging added that while Roberts may sometimes step up, “the conduct is undermining it,” referring to the court’s regular unexplained rulings in favor of Trump.

Roberts, who generally does not seek public attention, has long been known as an institutionalist who looks out for the interests of the Supreme Court, but several judges wondered whether that instinct extends to lower courts.

“He should be doing everything he can internally to insist on ordinary process,” the judge who has received threats said in reference to the emergency cases. Roberts' end-of-year report was “not enough,” the judge added.

Another judge said: “He hasn’t been completely absent, and he’s trying to do the best he can. I wish he would be a little bit more assertive and aggressive.”

Other judges are less willing to criticize Roberts.

“I do sympathize with the predicament the court is in, doing a dance with the administration, and particularly I’m sympathetic to Roberts,” the Obama-appointed judge said.

A district court judge indicated it was counterproductive to criticize Roberts or the court when the judiciary as a whole is under attack.

“We need to be united, not divided,” the judge said.

Roberts did not respond to a request for comment.

A federal judiciary employee familiar with Roberts’ institutional role said there are various reasons he is restrained from speaking out more. If he did, the employee said, the force of what he said would be diluted through repetition, and, with litigation pending in lower courts, he could face accusations of bias or calls for his recusal when he comments on specific cases.

“The chief justice has spoken out strongly against attacks on judges in various contexts, but he has been appropriately judicious in his statements, focusing on institutional norms and not personalities,” the employee said.

“The chief justice can’t be the public spokesperson against the administration and still do his job of deciding cases, including matters that involve the administration,” the person added.

So far, the only recent public defense from the court has come from conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who said at a legal conference in Kansas City, Missouri, last month that the court has been “doing more and more process to try to get the right answer” and offers more explanation in such cases than it did in the past. In the birthright citizenship cases, for example, the court heard oral arguments and issued a 26-page opinion explaining the decision.

One reason for keeping emergency decisions short, Kavanaugh said, is that the justices have to make decisions but do not necessarily want to pre-judge how cases will ultimately be decided when they come back to the court via the normal appeals process.

“There can be a risk ... of making a snap judgment and putting it in writing,” even though it might not reflect the court’s ultimate conclusion further down the line, he said.

While the Supreme Court wrestles internally with some of the criticism, lower court judges are increasingly focused on their own safety.

Judges have been calling for increased security in light of the frequent threats facing those who rule against or criticize the Trump administration, with some wondering whether the Supreme Court justices, who have faced harassment and threats, too, realize how vulnerable they are.

While the Supreme Court has its own police department to assist with security, other judges rely solely on the Marshals Service, which is under the control of Trump’s Justice Department, creating what some view as a potential point of vulnerability if tensions between the judiciary and the White House continue to mount.

The judge who reported receiving threats said that even if the Supreme Court is insulated from some of the violent rhetoric and believes the Trump administration will follow its rulings, the rule of law cannot function if it does not defend the lower courts.

“If the entire foundation falls out from under your house, it does no good to have a really well-insulated attic,” the judge said. “It sure would be nice if someone had our backs.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250815SCOTUSvJudgesBernis-jg-ef3ad9.jpg",N,,2025-09-04 05:56:56.808276

In power since 2019, the government describes its migration policies as “tough but fair”, denying allegations of illegal pushbacks to keep asylum seekers at bay.","Greece has passed draconian legislation that could mean rejected asylum seekers receiving prison terms, fines and orders to wear ankle tags, in a move that reflects the centre-right government’s continued attempts to deter undocumented migrants from arriving on its soil.

The tough penalties usher in an unprecedented era of zero tolerance for people who remain in the country if their asylum claims are denied. As a frontier state, long viewed as a gateway to Europe, Greece has had a surge in migrant arrivals this year.

“We are accountable to Greek citizens, and Greek citizens want to be protected,” the migration minister, Thanos Plevris, told MPs ahead of voting. “The message is clear [for migrants]: if your asylum request is rejected, you have two choices. Either you go to jail or return to your homeland. The Greek state does not accept you … You are not welcome.”

An unabashed rightwinger whose stance has caused ripples among the more moderate members of Greece’s centre-right government, Plevris insisted asylum would continue to be granted to applicants who fulfilled the need for international protection.

But under the new law, asylum seekers who have their claims rejected and do not leave the country within 14 days face prison terms of two to five years. Deterrence measures will also be toughened: people who arrive without the proper paperwork will be detained for 24 months, up from the current 18 months, while unregulated migrants who have been in Greece for seven years will no longer have the right to legalise their status. Those found guilty of illegal entry will be fined €10,000.

The measures come barely two months after the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced a controversial 90-day pause on asylum applications amid a rise in arrivals on the islands of Crete and Gavdos from Libya. In the first week of July, more than 2,000 people successfully made the crossing – a significant increase in a country where migrant numbers have fallen dramatically since 2015, when more than 850,000 people arrived at the height of the refugee crisis.

Mitsotakis insisted the suspension was aimed at sending smuggling rings a resounding message that “the passage to Greece is closed”, though it was condemned by human rights groups as a grave violation of international law.

In power since 2019, the government describes its migration policies as “tough but fair”, denying allegations of illegal pushbacks to keep asylum seekers at bay.

Addressing parliament, Plevris said he was proud to have overseen the legislation, which will put Greece at the forefront of policies that few EU members have wanted to enforce.

But on Wednesday the backlash was as instant as it was broad, with judges taking the unprecedented step of weighing in to criticise the legislation’s emphasis on repression.

Highlighting the lack of consensus over the measures, Dimitris Kairidis, who stepped down as migration and asylum minister in 2024, told the Guardian that while deterrence remained paramount, it was vital Athens also eased legal pathways of migration at a time when labour shortages were acute.

“Greece needs both to counter illegal, but also encourage legal, migration as needed by its growing economy,” he said.

During his tenure, Kairidis legalised the status of 30,000 unregistered migrant labourers desperately required in the agriculture, construction and tourism sectors.

With Greece gripped by a demographic crisis that last week forced the education ministry to close more than 750 schools because of the lack of pupils, migrant solidarity workers called the law racist and nonsensical.

“It’s so contradictory that this should be passed when Greece’s population is in such freefall, and when migrants offer the solution to labour shortages,” said the director of the Greek Council for Refugees, Lefteris Papagiannakis. “Mitsotakis has managed to hold the centre ground. With this openly racist law, he is clearly trying to enlarge his voter pool by appealing to the far right.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490abce60aef3f9a1dae85dcec8d2e091fe3b0b5/426_523_3515_2811/master/3515.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30dcc6e4120ef67d22269e0af9a0b234",N,,2025-09-04 07:56:24.927360

According to data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), President Donald Trump’s administration has overseen a sharp decline in the number of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) encountered by federal law enforcement officials, falling from 6,862 encounters in December to only 515 encounters in July: a 92.5% decrease. Since Trump returned to office at the end of January, CBP and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) divisions have encountered a total of just over 4,733 UACs, compared to the annual average under the Biden administration of over 127,500, a 96% decrease.

Under the Biden administration, the number of unaccompanied minors subjected to sex-trafficking more than tripled, rising from an annual average of 625 sex-trafficked children to 1,143 in then-president Joe Biden’s first year in the White House. The numbers continued rising from there. According to border czar and former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) chief Tom Homan, over 300,000 UACs went missing under the Biden administration, with many suspected of having been sex trafficked. “We’re gonna find some of them living with pedophiles, living in sex slavery, some are gonna be dead, but we gotta find these children,” Homan said shortly before Trump returned to office.

One of the reasons cross-border child-trafficking has decreased so steeply is the presence of ICE agents at meetings between UACs and adult sponsors. Reportedly, ICE agents have begun attending the meetings during which migrant children are to be released from DHS custody to the care of their U.S.-based “parents” or sponsors, who are often illegal immigrants themselves. The new policy directive was issued by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for the care of those minors. The new policy requires sponsors seeking custody of immigrant children to attend in-person meetings, rather than submit identification documents online, for more stringent vetting. Other measures taken by the Trump administration to protect immigrant children include mandatory fingerprinting of adult sponsors and all adult members of their households and allowing immigration officials to conduct home inspections and home visits.

Andrew Arthur, resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, explained in a recent article that a particular provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008 essentially created a loophole facilitating the trafficking of immigrant children. Section 235 of the TVPRA categorized unaccompanied minors as either coming from a “contiguous country” such as Canada or Mexico, allowing federal authorities to quickly deport the child if there was no credible fear of return, and those from “non-contiguous countries,” meaning everywhere else in the world. UACs from non-contiguous countries were required to be placed in the care of ORR and, if possible, eventually transferred to a sponsor in the U.S. “Not surprisingly, the number of non-contiguous UACs soared after Congress passed section 235 of the TVPRA, as parents (and more importantly smugglers) realized it essentially guaranteed that any child who could make it illegally across the line would be released into this country,” Arthur wrote. “ORR struggled to handle that UAC surge, to put it politely,” he added.

“You’d think that after all these hearings Congress would review … section 235 of the TVPRA, and either rescind [it] or at least fix the most glaring issues with the current UAC process,” Arthur quipped. He continued, “Congress premised that process on three naïve (and erroneous) propositions: (1) all UACs are better off with sponsors than in government custody; (2) most adult sponsors can be entrusted with a kid; and (3) it’s in the ‘best interests’ of alien children to come illegally with smugglers rather than to remain back home.” Arthur observed, “ORR has few defenders, but respectfully, in its haste to move UACs out of immigration custody, Congress failed to provide the office with any guidance on how to screen and when to deny would-be sponsors.” He continued, “As a result, it’s beyond cavil that children are raped, trafficked, exploited, and abused thanks to the [Homeland Security Act of 2002] and TVPRA, and whenever the volume of UACs at the border rises, those hells compound exponentially.”

Arthur pointed out that, under federal law, the smuggling of non-citizens into the U.S. qualifies as a class D felony, with a penalty of up to a decade in prison. “There’s no exception for adults who conspire to smuggle kids here, and if DHS throws a few would-be sponsors cum conspirators in jail for a decade, you’ll see the child-smuggling industry dry up quickly. But to find them, Congress must create a role for DHS in the sponsor-screening process from the outset,” Arthur wrote. He added, “Ideally, alien children encountered at the border would be handed over to USCIS officers to determine whether they have viable asylum or trafficking claims, and only if they do should they be placed with a sponsor here. If UACs don’t have an asylum or trafficking claim, however, they should be transferred to their own governments for placement abroad.”",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25I12_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:28.409987

Visas for representatives of foreign media outlets would be limited to 240 days under DHS’s proposal.
There were over 400,000 new F-1 visas issued by the State Department in 2024, 323,000 J-1 visas, and nearly 13,000 I visas.","On August 28, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed a rule in the Federal Register, titled “Establishing a Fixed Time Period of Admission and an Extension of Stay Procedure for Nonimmigrant Academic Students, Exchange Visitors, and Representatives of Foreign Information Media,” announcing a 30-day public comment period. The proposed rule seeks to limit the validity period for beneficiaries of those visas relative to the current rules.

Impact:

Under current regulations, persons who are beneficiaries of F visas for foreign students, J visas for exchange visitors, and I visas for representatives of foreign media outlets that have a home office in a foreign country, have their visas approved for a period that does not have a set duration, but instead is tied to specific program the visa holder is participating in or their employment. (This is known as being approved for a “duration of status.”)

DHS’s August 28 proposed rule seeks to change this to limit most admissions for foreign students at four years and possibly limit English language program students for two-years. The rule also proposes to shorten the grace period for leaving the country after completion of studies from 60 to 30 days. Visas for representatives of foreign media outlets would be limited to 240 days under DHS’s proposal.

There are nearly 1.6 million active records for persons who hold F-1 and M-1 visas; a miniscule share of those are M-1 holders, as there were 6,322 M-1 visas issued in 2024 (M-1 visas are not impacted by the proposed rule but are lumped together with F-1 by DHS in data reports). There were over 400,000 new F-1 visas issued by the State Department in 2024, 323,000 J-1 visas, and nearly 13,000 I visas.

DHS notes in their reasoning for the proposal that the current system undermines the agency’s ability to monitor and enforce compliance and results in fewer check-ins with DHS to verify compliance, and leads to insufficient monitoring of beneficiaries. DHS also cited national security concerns. It is difficult to know if these measures will significantly impact demand for visas in these three categories, but the President’s Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a lobby group for universities, argues that it will burden schools and students and deter foreign students and academics from coming to the United States.",https://files.epi.org/uploads/Federal-Policy-Watch-Project-2025-action-950x534.png,N,,2025-09-04 05:56:48.391673

Washington, D.C., September 3, 2025—On September 9, the U.S. Census Bureau will release national Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance data for 2024. We expect the numbers to show more poverty in 2024, particularly among children, and more people without health insurance. When we see the data, however, we must consider that the outlook for 2025 and beyond is ominous, given how precipitously the conditions for people facing economic insecurity have declined this year.

Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the administration and Congress have unleashed a cascade of attacks on people with low incomes, including communities of color, immigrants and their families, and others who have been historically marginalized. These attacks have included slashing public benefit programs; issuing executive orders dismantling diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives; ripping families apart through a horrific mass deportation effort and gutting protections and services to immigrants, including U.S. citizen children; eliminating labor protections for millions of workers; and decimating the nation’s data collection efforts that are critical to accurate and equitable decision-making. Through these and other actions, the Trump Administration’s reckless disregard for people’s health, safety, and well-being will have dire consequences for the future of the country.

These attacks are particularly evident in the reconciliation bill passed by Congress, which is causing unprecedented harm to workers, people of color, immigrants, women, and children. In addition to excluding many families with low incomes from the Child Tax Credit, the bill cuts essential benefit programs, including Medicaid and SNAP. Although these changes will not be fully implemented until 2026 and beyond, they are already having a chilling effect among people who rely on these programs to meet their basic needs. Congress made these cuts to fund historic increases in immigration enforcement that undermine family unity and well-being and to provide tax cuts to the wealthy, which will only exacerbate poverty and wealth inequality.

The September 9 data will likely show another annual increase in people without health insurance coverage. The end of Covid-era protections for Medicaid coverage caused many people to lose coverage in 2024, although the availability of enhanced premium tax credits in the Marketplace likely offset some Medicaid losses. Congress’s action in 2025 to cut Medicaid and enhanced Marketplace tax credits by more than $1 trillion is estimated to cause nearly 15 million people to lose coverage in the coming years.

The full effect of millions of people losing health insurance, food assistance, and other supports—and how that loss will harm not just individuals but their families, communities, and the larger economy—will drive even more people deeper into poverty and instability for years to come.

We will have more to say after the Census Bureau releases the data next week. For now, CLASP reiterates our commitment to fighting for policies that center the dignity and autonomy of all people, especially those whom the Trump Administration and the current majority in Congress are most focused on harming with their punitive and dangerous actions.",https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-24.png,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:32.524631

Both governments signed a secretive deal last week under which Nauru will resettle up to 354 people who have no legal right to stay in Australia in exchange for an initial 408 million Australian dollar payment ($267m) and about 70 million Australian dollars ($46m) each year thereafter.

Independent Senator David Pocock said a “snap Senate hearing” on Wednesday night revealed that the “agreement with Nauru to send asylum seekers there” could cost the Australian government up to 2.5 billion Australian dollars ($1.6bn) over 30 years.

The Senate hearing came after Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke announced last week that he had signed a memorandum with Nauru’s president “for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru”.

“It’s in both nations’ interest to move through this as efficiently as we can,” said Clare Sharp, head of immigration from the Department of Home Affairs.

“It’s in Nauru’s interest, because money doesn’t flow until people arrive,” she said.

With an estimated population of some 12,500 and a mainland measuring just 21 square kilometres (8.1 square miles), Nauru is among the world’s smallest countries.

Nauru’s President David Adeang said in a statement on Sunday that the agreement with Australia will “support Nauru’s long-term economic resilience”.

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the deal with Nauru was “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous”.

Favero said the broad wording in the deal could enable many thousands of people to be deported from Australia.

“That’s tens of thousands of lives at risk – not the tiny number the government would have Australians believe,” Favero said in a statement.

Australian immigration officials said there are no guarantees all 354 people – including some convicted of serious crimes – will be deported to Nauru, with the Pacific island making the final decision.

Australia’s government has struggled to find a way to deal with immigrants who have no other country to go to when their visas are cancelled. The country’s High Court ruled in 2023 that indefinite detention was unlawful if deportation was not an option, leading to the release of 220 people.

The number of people in that situation in Australia now numbers 354, government officials said.

In February, Australia paid an undisclosed sum for Nauru to accept three immigrants convicted of violent offences, though legal challenges have reportedly stalled their transfer.

Nauru was one of two countries Australia initially sent asylum seekers to when it first began its controversial offshore detention programme in 2001.

In June 2023, the last refugees remaining on Nauru returned to Australia after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese fulfilled an election promise to end offshore detention.

In January this year, the United Nations Human Rights Committee found Australia’s offshore policy had violated two provisions of the legally-binding 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – one on arbitrary detention and one protecting the right to challenge detention in court.

Nauru has in recent years turned to other migration-related schemes in attempts to revive its economy, which historically has relied on thriving exports of phosphate, a key ingredient used in fertiliser. But those supplies have long dried up, and researchers today estimate 80 percent of Nauru has been rendered uninhabitable by mining.

These are not ordinary times. It’s not just that the Trump administration is taking actions that horrify and offend us. It’s that in just seven months, President Trump has all but dismantled a democratic system that took more than 200 years to build.

He and his team have failed to comply with nearly a third of major judicial rulings against them. They have created heavily-armed goon squads that seize people off the streets without warrants or due process.

They have eliminated, intimidated or coerced into submission all the institutions — the free press, academia, the courts, independent inspectors general, regulators, scientific panels and data — that used to guard against corruption and abuse.

Republicans in Congress have completely abdicated their power of the purse. Whatever checks and balances that once existed are ceasing to function.

We are now, for all intents and purposes, living in a dictatorship where the rules are made and changed at the whim of a single person, and the only beneficiaries are the ultra-rich.

Yet Democrats in Congress are largely conducting business as usual, as if this were merely a policy squabble. They continue to attend sham hearings, cooperate with Republicans in drafting legislation that will be ignored or circumvented by the administration and allow nominations to go through without a serious fight.

Lacking the votes to stop the worst excesses of Trump and his sycophants, Democratic legislators seem to think their options are limited to negotiating deals that are less horrendous or voting “no.”

But there is more that Democrats can and should do if they want to demonstrate a credible alternative to the current mayhem and win back the trust and support of the American people.

First, they should stop playing ball with Republicans and adopt a policy of strategic non-cooperation. They should refuse to help Republicans make a quorum, negotiate budget deals and pass legislation.

There is no point in making terrible bills marginally less bad when money they add goes unspent, restrictions they insert go unheeded and protections they demand are subverted. Instead, they should use the rules to obstruct and delay proceedings that are likely to end in further erosion of our rights.

As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put it, “every time that we go along with these appropriations bills, we’re putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of his campaign to destroy our democracy.”

Second, they should show who and what they stand for and how they would govern differently.

Congressional Democrats should establish caucuses that function as shadow committees, holding their own hearings, issuing their own reports, and conducting their own investigations on issues of key importance to the American public.

Together with governors and party leadership, they should create a shadow cabinet, akin to the United Kingdom’s Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet. This would give Democrats an opportunity to show what they would do if they were in charge.

The shadow secretaries would lay out their vision and budget for their respective departments and issue detailed critiques of the current administration’s actions and omissions.

The party should adopt a clear and simple set of priorities, such as increasing affordability, improving family health and security and limiting the power of big money.

Third, Democrats in Washington should spend more time in their home states and districts, listening to local communities and supporting local leaders. With nothing useful happening in the nation’s capital, the momentum for change has shifted to municipal governments and civic campaigns.

National legislators can do more good by learning from and lending their voice to local movements than by giving floor speeches and proposing federal legislation that goes nowhere.

Finally, Democrats should build closer relationships with their counterparts in countries that have successfully emerged from authoritarian rule.

Organized resistance movements in Spain, Chile, Poland, South Africa and South Korea helped bring about peaceful democratic transitions, and they have much to teach us about preventing, countering and surviving tyranny.

If the last seven months have taught us anything, it should be that democracy is fragile and requires vigilance. Fascism can happen here, too.

Requirement to Carry Proof of Registration All foreign nationals over the age of 18 who are required to register must carry their proof of registration with them at all times.
Foreign nationals must also notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days of the change.","Real World Impact: Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published an interim final rule (IFR) that provides a new online process for unregistered foreign nationals to comply with the decades-old but rarely enforced registration requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The IFR also requires foreign nationals over the age of 18 to carry proof of registration with them at all times. Failure to register or carry proof of registration is punishable by fines and possible imprisonment.

Background: Under the INA, with limited exceptions, foreign nationals age 14 or older who were not registered or fingerprinted (if required) when they applied for a visa and who are staying in the U.S. for 30 days or longer must apply for registration and fingerprinting. Parents and legal guardians of foreign nationals under age 14 must ensure they are registered. Within 30 days of turning 14, a foreign national, regardless of whether they previously registered, must apply for registering and fingerprinting.

Who is Already Considered Registered?

Certain foreign nationals are considered preregistered, and no additional registration action is needed: lawful permanent residents, those with Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), those on sponsored work visas who have an I-94, their family members who have a valid I-94, and a few other categories. A full list of those who are considered preregistered is available on the USCIS website at: https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration.

Who is Not Considered Registered?

Certain foreign nationals are not considered registered and must do so, including those who entered the U.S. without inspection, children who are turning 14 (as noted above), and visa-exempt Canadian visitors who entered at a land port of entry, were not issued an I-94 upon entry, and are staying in the U.S. longer than 30 days.

New Registration Form

USCIS has developed a new registration form that those who are not registered can use: https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/g-325r. Note that the use of this form to register is not an immigration status and does not confer employment authorization or provide any other right or benefit under the INA or other U.S. law.

Evidence of Registration

The following documents are considered evidence of registration:

I-94, Arrival-Departure Record—Aliens admitted as nonimmigrants; aliens paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; aliens whose claimed entry prior to July 1, 1924, cannot be verified, having satisfactorily established residence in the United States since prior to July 1, 1924; and aliens granted permission to depart without the institution of deportation proceedings.

I-95, Crewmen's Landing Permit—Crewmen arriving by vessel or aircraft.

I-184, Alien Crewman Landing Permit and Identification Card—Crewmen arriving by vessel.

I-185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card—Citizens of Canada or British subjects residing in Canada.

I-186, Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card—Citizens of Mexico residing in Mexico.

I-221, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing—Aliens against whom deportation proceedings are being instituted.

I-221S, Order to Show Cause, Notice of Hearing, and Warrant for Arrest of Alien—Aliens against whom deportation proceedings are being instituted.

I-551, Permanent Resident Card—Lawful permanent resident of the United States.

I-766, Employment Authorization Document.

Form I-862, Notice to Appear—Aliens against whom removal proceedings are being instituted.

Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge—Aliens against whom removal proceedings are being instituted.

USCIS Proof of Alien G-325R Registration, or its successor form (this newly developed form is discussed above).

See https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-264/section-264.1. In addition to the documents listed above, a valid, unexpired DHS admission or parole stamp in a foreign passport constitutes evidence of registration.

Requirement to Carry Proof of Registration

All foreign nationals over the age of 18 who are required to register must carry their proof of registration with them at all times. For green card holders, this means carrying their Permanent Resident cards with them at all times. As with any important personal documents, we recommend people make copies of their proof of registration in case of loss or theft. Foreign nationals must also notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days of the change. A failure to comply with either of these requirements is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and imprisonment of up to 30 days, or both.

The Bottom Line

While most noncitizen employees will be considered preregistered and do not need to reregister, it is important that they ensure they have proof of registration with them at all times. Few arrests have been reported for failure to possess proof of registration, but it is important to ensure that foreign nationals are prepared to demonstrate their compliance with the registration requirement in light of the USCIS’s increased focus on worksite enforcement. If someone is detained and asked to provide this documentation, they are not required to answer any questions and can ask to speak to their lawyer. Following arrests for failure to register, some courts have dismissed charges where prosecutors were unable to articulate probable cause for the defendant’s knowledge of the registration requirement and/or intentional refusal to register. Accordingly, awareness of the registration requirement appears important for any related criminal liability.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.854_4308.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:35.007936

The Trump administration has claimed — without providing evidence — that the casualties of the strike were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that it has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

“Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, following the attack. “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!”

The White House posted an image on social media of Trump looking at a phone showing footage of the boat being hit. “TERRORISTS ELIMINATED. ADIÓS,” the post says, with an emoji of a person placing items in the trash.

In another post, the White House said: “ON VIDEO: U.S. Military Forces conducted a strike against Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the U.S. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.”

The Trump administration has circulated a brief black and white video that it says shows the fatal strike. AP reports that the White House “did not immediately explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members.” The outlet also noted that the video “is not clear enough to see if the craft is carrying as many as 11 people” and “did not show any large or clear stashes of drugs inside the boat.”

Experts say the administration’s deadly strike violated international law.

“Labeling someone a terrorist and deploying the military does not make them a military target,” Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement to Truthout. “These actions amount to an extra-judicial killing, a violation of international law, which should raise extraordinary concerns.”

“Without clear limitations on presidential and military authority, we may find this administration claiming that it can execute alleged drug dealers at home without any judicial process as happened under the Duterte regime in the Philippines,” Warren continued. Former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is now at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of committing crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, and torture, in the context of the government’s so-called “war on drugs” campaign.

“Using military forces to kill alleged drug traffickers is an act of murder, not war,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Truthout in a statement following the attack on Tuesday.

Civil rights attorney Alec Karakatsanis called the killings “extra-judicial assassinations — a preemptive death penalty with no process — for vague alleged nonviolent drug distribution offenses.”

Trump has a long history of calling for U.S. intervention to overthrow Venezuela’s government, and has escalated tensions in recent days by building up the U.S. military’s presence near the country. The Trump administration has also frequently accused people of belonging to Tren de Aragua to justify violations of their human rights.

Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization and subsequently invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to send more than 250 Venezuelans living in the United States to El Salvador’s notoriously brutal prison, CECOT. The administration repeatedly accused the men of being Tren de Aragua members, despite the fact that a majority did not have criminal convictions.

After four months, they were sent home to Venezuela in a prisoner swap deal between Venezuela and the United States. The men, including a soccer coach, a makeup artist, and a musician, have reported that they were physically and psychologically tortured at the prison.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-3-trump-at-white-house.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:38.351940

A majority of justices will, of course, never say that they believe this nonsense about Tren de Aragua conducting an invasion or predatory incursion against the United States.","The Situation last week contemplated the deployment of National Guard and federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C.

And I fully expected when I awoke this morning to continue in the same vein today and discuss Mayor Muriel Bowser’s executive order aligning city policy with Trump’s federal law enforcement posture vis-a-vis the city—a subject to which I will return.

But when I woke up and glanced at my computer, I found news that genuinely surprised me: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had rejected President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being members of Tren de Aragua. The Fifth Circuit is perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country. What’s more, I had listened to the oral argument in the case, and it frankly didn’t lead me to think the opinion would come out like this.

Yet there it was: a 2-to-1 opinion in which the majority holds that President Trump just can’t make the Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportations when the president determines there has been an “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” cover immigrants from Venezuela by issuing a proclamation claiming that the Tren de Aragua gang is state-controlled and that the immigration is some kind of incursion.

I have a few observations about this case:

The first is that opinion, by Judge Leslie Southwick, is a slog to read. It is not especially well argued or reasoned, in my view. It will not go down in history as a wonderful piece of legal writing. There are no memorable lines.

But the quality of the opinion actually doesn’t matter very much. Not all opinions can have soaring rhetoric that makes one’s heart go pitter-patter. Not all the children can be above average. And some opinions are important less for their quality or reasoning or writing than as indicators.

This opinion is an indicator—an indicator that not all conservative judges feel the need to defer to the bullshit. It’s not the first such indicator. And it’s not the most eloquent. But it’s the strongest evidence we’ve seen so far in the Alien Enemy Act context. And that’s a hopeful sign.

The key point here is that the Trump administration had a chance to argue its extravagant claim of power to deport people based on complete fiction before one of the few courts of appeals in the country that is consistently more conservative than the Supreme Court. And it couldn’t persuade a panel of that court to uphold its invocation of an 18th Century legacy of the John Adams administration to deal with a 21st Century gang. That does not bode well for Trump’s chances before Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett—who together define the legal scope of modern American presidential autocracy.

The Fifth Circuit here is just a waystation. What matters here is only the signal that this is an issue that will divide conservative jurists.

But let’s pause a moment to be candid about the legal issue at stake in this case, and let’s bother to state it more precisely than the Fifth Circuit did. The issue the case presents is what deference, if any, the courts owe to official presidential lies. Do judges owe such deference to knowing and intentional untruths as to detain and deport people based on them? Or are they allowed to, in the common vernacular of our time, call bullshit on the president?

This is not an exaggeration meant for effect. I mean it very literally. The March 15 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act is predicated on the following statements: “I find and declare that [Tren de Aragua] TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.”

That is not a true statement, and Trump’s finding and declaring it doesn’t make it true.

And on the basis of this untrue statement, the president finds that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

So now let me distill for you a lengthy and turgid judicial opinion into three short sentences of plain English:

Tren de Aragua is not, in fact, perpetrating or attempting an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States by any reasonable understanding of the terms in question.

Whatever crimes its members may be committing, it is not conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States—at least not such as might be considered a predatory incursion.

Consequently, Venezuelan citizens cannot lawfully be apprehended and removed as Alien Enemies.

The majority opinion does not call the statements in Trump’s proclamation lies, because in the mannered style of judicial opinions, one just doesn’t say that the president is gaslighting the public in an official presidential proclamation. Comity between the branches or something like that.

But I’m going to be blunt about it: I don’t believe for a second that Trump or his lawyers actually believe that Venezuelan immigration, even by Tren de Aragua members, constitutes an invasion or predatory incursion within the meaning of the Alien Enemies Act. They are relying instead on a claim about the unreviewable nature of the president’s power to decide these things, not about the truth or reasonableness of what he has decided.

And that question of reviewability is what divides the panel.

The dissent, by Judge Andrew Oldham, argues that the court is obliged to accept these lies. “What is the upshot of this series of cases?” he asks, having gone over the relevant case law. “All of them recognize one fundamental principle: The President’s judgment call as to the existence of a state of war, invasion, or insurrection is conclusive.”

Judge Oldham may well prove correct as a bellwether of where a majority of the Supreme Court comes down. A majority of justices will, of course, never say that they believe this nonsense about Tren de Aragua conducting an invasion or predatory incursion against the United States.

But they could end up signing off on the happy fiction that they have to pretend they believe that President Trump really believes this garbage (comity between the branches being what it is and all, and he having sworn an oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and all). And they thus could end up taking the position that it is not their job to determine, as Judge Oldham put it, that “the Executive’s finding [is] so implausible it should be overridden by a handful of generals-in-robes.” Even though it is so implausible that generals-in-robes who refuse to override it should be careful about calling themselves lawyers.

But while Judge Oldham may get the last laugh, Judge Southwick’s opinion offers proof that at least some conservative jurists look—and thus hope that maybe two Supreme Court justices will look—at the president’s proclamation and say that there has to be some limit to the deference owed to the president when he is just blowing smoke in the faces of the judges.

If the president had issued a proclamation that said, “I find and declare that an eggplant is perpetrating an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States” and that therefore “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA” are deportable, would any judge find such a statement “conclusive” as to an individual’s detainability or removability? The current order is hardly less nonsensical a basis on which to lock people up and put them on planes.

DECORAH — Calls to protect immigrant residents from federal enforcement dominated Tuesday night’s Decorah City Council meeting, as speakers urged adoption of a proposed ""separation ordinance"" that would limit local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The issue appeared on the agenda as ""Discussion on Public Comment Received Regarding Jail Services and Arrestees,"" after weeks of organizing by residents and the advocacy group Decorah Community for Immigrant Rights. Supporters said the ordinance would prevent local police and jail services from going beyond what federal or state law requires in working with ICE.

During public comment, Ruth Palmer, a volunteer with the Immigration Action Network, told the council she opposed the federal agency’s practices but urged unity in the local debate.

""With the group that’s gathered here, I share a common concern for the rights of immigrants, but I oppose their proposed separation ordinance, because the focus of all in this room needs to be on protecting rights. On building unity, not separation,"" Palmer said.

""We need the passion, the energy, the ideas of every person here to commit to the protection of the most vulnerable in our community, recognizing that we are only as strong as our weakest link.""

Other speakers demanded clearer limits on cooperation with ICE. Christine Mohrhauser of DCIR cited deaths and abuses in immigration detention on a federal level.

""Do the people of Decorah really want to be known as complacently handing over our neighbors?"" she asked. ""We do not want our police department aiding this known abusive agency any more than that which is absolutely legally necessary.""

Matthew Alexander, a Decorah resident of more than 30 years, invoked his Norwegian immigrant ancestors in urging support.

""When I consider what it would have been like for my Norwegian great-grandparents to have experienced such cruel action, it stops me in my tracks,"" he said. ""We support this proposed separation ordinance to allow for respect and pause in the lightning attacks on people and to give inherent human rights and freedoms.""

Some residents framed the proposal as both moral and practical. Andrea Beck, who immigrated from Spain in 2013, told council members: ""As a former immigrant myself, I support this ordinance because it helps Decorah comply with federal immigration enforcement without giving away extra information that could compromise the safety of our immigrants.""

She warned that many local immigrants ""don't feel safe walking around in our community anymore.""

But opponents questioned whether the city had the authority to act. Retired Spanish teacher Margaret Betteridge, who volunteers as an interpreter for IAN, said: ""This proposed ordinance is not something that our city can realistically adopt. This type of reform needs to happen at the state or national level. Unfortunately, our city government can’t legislate ICE.""

Others rebutted that claim. Eric Rovelo of DCIR told the council the ordinance was designed only to ensure local agencies ""do exactly what’s required under the law and nothing that isn’t explicitly required."" He noted that more than 40 cities and 160 counties across the U.S. have passed similar measures.

City Manager Travis Goedken prefaced the council’s discussion by reading a prepared statement, cautioning that nothing discussed should be seen as restricting cooperation with federal agencies.

""Nothing that I give as a statement should be construed as discouraging, prohibiting or restricting law enforcement officers, employees or officials from cooperating with or assisting in federal immigration law enforcement activities,"" Goedken said, citing Iowa Code Chapter 27A.

Council Member Cody Whittle said he asked for the item to be placed on the agenda because the community deserved transparency.

""When I think about how I want government to work, I think if the public brings something forth and wants to discuss it, I think that we owe it to them to do that in an honest and open way,"" Whittle said. He praised both sides of the debate for ""so much in common … they care so much about human rights and share a deep concern for immigrants.""

Council Member Emily Neil said she deliberated at length before agreeing to place the item on the agenda. While she called it ""a moral moment,"" Neil asserted the ordinance as drafted would not protect immigrants and could instead draw harmful attention.

""The ordinance proposed is either outside of the jurisdiction of the city council, against the law, or in some cases already practiced and covered by other city ordinances,"" Neil said. ""Additionally, it opens up our city manager and our officers to unnecessary conflicts as they try to determine how to enforce a city ordinance that is in direct opposition to state law.""

Neil also stressed that the city has no control over the county jail, a focal point of the ordinance.

""The county owns the jail and is responsible for its oversight. To be clear, the Decorah City Council has no oversight of the county jail. It merely sits on land owned by the city,"" she said.

Council Member Brent Parker echoed that point, saying the ordinance confused the roles of city and county.

""We have no say in what our elected sheriff does in his jail,"" Parker said. ""If you have issues, maybe this is talking to him, not using the city of Decorah to circumvent that.""

Council Member Steve Zittergruen pointed to the city’s police department as already taking steps to support immigrants. He noted that officers use a language line to communicate with non-English speakers and provide a complaint process, and that no formal complaints had been received.

""I think they’re reaching out and doing the right things,"" Zittergruen said, citing Police Chief Trisha Thein’s prior experience in Marshalltown, a city ""with a more diverse population.""

Council Member Christopher Miculinich called the ordinance’s supporters sincere and urged broader collaboration.

""At the end of the day I don’t want to take a professional position on the set ordinance,"" Miculinich said. ""I think it’s great we’re having the conversation, but … we do have a bunch of other local organizations that are fighting for the same needs in our community. I would urge a collective effort.""

Despite rejecting the ordinance in its current form, members repeatedly thanked residents for their comments.

""I appreciate the conversation that has occurred here tonight. I know that’s not an easy thing,"" Miculinich added. ""The fact that you guys are getting up and having these conversations is a great thing to see.""

At a press conference held after the meeting, members of DCIR described the council discussion as a breakthrough, despite the council’s stance on the ordinance.

""Tonight, City Council made a critical move by putting the separation ordinance on the agenda, and that matters,"" Aime Rovelo, a member of DCIR, said. ""Its goal is simple: keep our community safe by drawing a clear line between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement.""

Speakers said codifying limits on cooperation is necessary to protect against future changes in leadership.

""Nothing in this ordinance is against the police,"" Joshua Ratel-Khan said. ""What we’re asking for is to codify what those discussions have looked like. You cannot guarantee that all police officers or the chief of police will continue to enact this law, especially in the political climate we’re in.""

They also rejected claims that state law blocks local action.

""They may say that Code 27A prevents us from enacting many of these things in this ordinance, but again, that’s not true,"" Ratel-Khan said. ""Our ordinance doesn’t say we don’t want our police to cooperate with ICE. It says we don’t want to go above and beyond what the law requires.""

Advocates framed the measure as part of a broader national movement.

""This ordinance comes from the people, from years of organizing by immigrant-led groups across the country … We know ICE is already in Iowa. Arrests are climbing. This is not a hypothetical scenario, it is very real,"" Rovelo said. ""We will keep organizing, keep showing up and keep fighting until every immigrant in Decorah can live with dignity, safety, and freedom from deportation.""",http://dircx6nshkvfy.cloudfront.net/360_Decorah_Live/0/0/0/0/19/948/19948_1,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:42.916339

Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/landor-v-louisiana-department-of-corrections-and-public-safety/,"When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights under RLIUPA, the district court held that RLIUPA does not provide for damages against individual state officials.
The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Landor asked the Supreme Court to hear his case.
Finally, there is no principled reason that state employees in particular may not be personally liable for damages under RLUIPA.
State employees are uniquely positioned as state actors to be held liable for actions in violation of funding terms that the state knowingly accepted.
The Supreme Court should reverse the Fifth Circuit, allowing Damon Landor to seek damages.","The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act protects the religious freedom of incarcerated people. Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, wore his hair in dreadlocks in accordance with his religion. After serving the first four months of his sentence at facilities where administrators respected his religious practice, that changed with his transfer to Raymond Laborde Correctional Center. There, when Landor showed the prison officials a printout of a Fifth Circuit decision holding that RLIUPA protected his right to keep his dreadlocks, they threw the decision into the trash, held him down, and shaved his head. When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights under RLIUPA, the district court held that RLIUPA does not provide for damages against individual state officials. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Landor asked the Supreme Court to hear his case.

In September 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in support of Landor. Our brief makes three principal points.

First, Congress has broad discretion to make federal funding contingent on statutory conditions and craft remedies for violations of those conditions. The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to spend for the “general Welfare of the United States.” The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress has substantial discretion to define “the concept of the general welfare” and exercise its spending power accordingly. When Congress grants federal funds to a state subject to conditions it deems to be in furtherance of the general welfare, it also has significant discretion to ensure compliance with those conditions, including by using its legislative power to craft remedies for noncompliance, such as private rights of action. The Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause underscores Congress’s authority in this area.

Second, the court below erred when it claimed to import contract law “wholesale” to rewrite RLIUPA’s express private right of action. The Supreme Court has used contract law principles to interpret the application of the Spending Clause in two limited scenarios: to ensure that funding recipients had sufficient notice of the specific conduct prohibited by Congress, and to fill in statutory gaps about the type of relief available. The Court has refused to employ the contract-law analogy to displace or invalidate clear statutory text, emphasizing that the contract-law analogy does not sanction incorporating contract law “wholesale.”

The contract-law analogy has limited utility in this case: it simply raises the question of whether state funding recipients had sufficient notice when they accepted federal funds that their employees may be held individually liable for damages if they violate RLUIPA’s substantive provisions. The answer to that question is yes. The Supreme Court has held that identical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protected the ability to seek damages against state employees in their individual capacity. The Fifth Circuit supplied no reason to interpret the identical language in RLIUPA differently, because there is none.

Finally, there is no principled reason that state employees in particular may not be personally liable for damages under RLUIPA. RLUIPA does not impose liability on just anyone for violating its terms. It imposes liability on employees of the state. State employees are uniquely positioned as state actors to be held liable for actions in violation of funding terms that the state knowingly accepted.

Notably, just two years ago the Supreme Court reaffirmed that Spending Clause statutes, like all other federal laws, may give rise to privately enforceable rights pursuant to Section 1983 even where Congress does not include a cause of action in the statute itself. Here, Congress explicitly authorized private parties to enforce RLUIPA against state officials by importing Section 1983’s language into RLUIPA’s express cause of action. Rather than honor that statutory text, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized Congress for its clarity.

Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311962644.html,"The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States would lose their deportation protections and work permits under Temporary Protected Status by next week.
The decision will also be heavily felt in South Florida, the heart of the Venezuelan community in the United States.
“Venezuelans under TPS are not a burden—they are a resilient community that brings value, hope, and integrity to this nation.
It then created a second TPS designation in 2023 that further expanded the protections so more people would benefit.
It also similarly invoked the argument that the TPS designation was not in the national interests of the United States.","The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States would lose their deportation protections and work permits under Temporary Protected Status by next week.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the agency had reviewed conditions in Venezuela in collaboration with the State Department, and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had determined that the 2021 TPS designation for Venezuela was “contrary to the national interest.”

“Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,” said an agency spokesperson in a statement.

The decision leaves about 257,000 Venezuelans, including many in South Florida, vulnerable to being deported to a homeland deep in crisis and under the repressive governance of leader Nicolas Maduro.

The decision will also be heavily felt in South Florida, the heart of the Venezuelan community in the United States. On Wednesday, advocates and leaders were already reeling from the announcement.

“Venezuelans under TPS are not a burden—they are a resilient community that brings value, hope, and integrity to this nation. Ignoring their reality would be a failure to uphold the fundamental principles of compassion and justice that have long defined the United States,” said Helene Villalonga, a Venezuelan activist and president of the Multicultural Association of Activists for Voice and Expression.

In a separate announcement in February, the Trump administration ended TPS protections for another group of approximately 350,000 Venezuelan beneficiaries, arguing that conditions in the country have changed sufficiently to allow them to safely return. The vast majority currently do not enjoy TPS protections, and only about 5,000 currently have their TPS work permits as a result of ongoing litigation out of a federal district court in California. Their fate lies in the hands of Judge Edward Chen, who has been overseeing that lawsuit.

Substantial evidence suggests that many TPS holders would face severe consequences if repatriated. Many could be subjected to imprisonment, torture, or even death at the hands of the same government they once fled.

“The situation has definitely not improved in Venezuela,” Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, told the Miami Herald in a recent interview. “On the contrary, following the July 28 elections of 2024, repression and political persecution have intensified. We currently have at least 890 political prisoners, including 72 foreigners, and at least 66 people who are missing, with their whereabouts still unknown.”

In addition to political persecution, returning Venezuelans would reenter a country teetering on collapse—maligned by hyperinflation, soaring unemployment, rampant crime, frequent power outages, water shortages and chronic scarcities of food and medicine.

Ironically, the assertion that Venezuela is safe is not consistently reflected across the Trump administration. The State Department has repeatedly urged U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Venezuela under any circumstances.

“Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure. All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately,” a State Department advisory stated in May.

The Biden administration first granted Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans in 2021, a move that was largely celebrated in South Florida, home to one of the largest populations of people from the South American country. It then created a second TPS designation in 2023 that further expanded the protections so more people would benefit.

In February, the Trump administration ended the 2023 designation, a move which has led to fierce battles in the federal courts. The Trump administration ended the 2021 designation on Tuesday. It is set to expire on Sept. 10.

Wednesday’s announcement will face challenges in the federal courts. Last week, a federal appeals court in San Francisco unanimously affirmed Judge Chen’s decision decision to keep TPS while litigation is ongoing. It also ruled that TPS for Venezuelans should be kept until October 2026, like Chen had ruled in a preliminary injunction in March, because conditions in the country have not improved and Noem had ended it improperly. Venezuelans are now awaiting for Chen in San Francisco to issue a final determination on the matter.

However, earlier this year, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court asking the nation’s top judges to intervene in the lower court’s case in an emergency order. It ruled that Homeland Security had the authority to end TPS but did not rule on the merits of the case Chen is overseeing or shut down active lawsuits.

In the federal register notice that ended the 2023 designation in February, the Trump administration said that there were notable improvements in areas such as the “economy, public health, and crime” which allowed Venezuelans to go back. It also similarly invoked the argument that the TPS designation was not in the national interests of the United States.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has targeted Venezuelans through his mass deportation efforts. He has ended a parole program for several countries that allowed over 117,000 Venezuelans to legally live and work in the United States for two years and invoked a wartime act to send hundreds of Venezuelans the government accused of being gang members to a notorious terrorist prison in El Salvador.

The end of TPS also comes one day after the Trump administration blew up a boat, killing 11 people which federal officials say were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua transporting drugs to the United States. Typically, boats engaged in the illicit drug trade would be intercepted at sea by federal authorities and occupants are processed through the criminal justice system.

Adelys Ferro — the director of the Venezuelan American Caucus and who has been involved in the ongoing federal litigation — said that it’s a contradiction that the administration is launching an aggressive campaign against drug trafficking and gangs in Venezuela while saying that Venezuelans in the United States can return.

“We will continue fighting,” she said.

José Antonio Colina, the president of the Miami-based Organization of the Politically Persecuted Venezuelans in Exile, said that his hope now rested on the District Court.

“In the midst of all this political and military situation between the United States and Venezuela, sending Venezuelans back there, where their lives are at risk, is basically exposing them to a death sentence,” he said

""It keeps people silenced, which domestic violence already inherently does; and then you add a layer of immigration status on top of that?","Witnesses say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted outside of the Domestic Violence Courthouse in Chicago's West Loop on Wednesday, taking at least one person into federal custody ahead of their scheduled court appearance.

The incident comes as the Trump administration has been preparing to launch a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago by the end of the week.

The courthouse at 555 W. Harrison St. opens at 8:30 a.m. each weekday. One woman, whose name CBS News Chicago is withholding because of the nature of her case, was set to appear in court at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, but didn't make it there.

According to court records, she wasn't in court because she was in ICE custody.

Witnesses said they saw a man, who they believe to be a federal officer, assist in her arrest outside the courthouse about 15 minutes before her scheduled time to appear.

A victim advocate asked why the woman was being arrested, and said an agent told her, ""We're going to speak to her about her immigration status"" before putting the woman in handcuffs.

CBS News Chicago has learned the woman in this case was an accused abuser, arrested by the Chicago Police Department and charged with two misdemeanor counts of domestic battery.

Court records indicated the charges were dropped on Wednesday.

""Sounds like as soon as we got word, my advocates and a bunch of other advocates and legal aid attorneys came down and started passing out 'know your rights' information,"" said Tessa Kuipers, program director and policy advisor at Family Rescue.

Victim advocates said the incident has people concerned they'll need to choose between reporting domestic violence and facing ICE when they show up to court.

There have been previous reports about ICE agents showing up to the Chicago Immigration Court, but no such reports of them showing up at Domestic Violence Court until now.

After the arrest, standing in the lobby of the Domestic Violence Courthouse, it was clear others decided not to attend their hearings because they were afraid to face ICE.

""My advocates were calling the survivors that had planned to come to court today, and telling them that ICE is there,"" Kuipers said.

Kuipers works as a victim advocate at the courthouse. She said she worries the arrest will deter victims of domestic violence from reporting their abusers.

""Just making people, survivors, unsafer. Obviously, survivors are going to know ICE was here. They're going to have hesitancy about seeking protections, about connecting with their advocate and orders of protection and criminal charges that might be a tool for safety for them,"" Kuipers said.

In a statement, Amanda Pyron, the CEO of The Network: Advocating Against Domestic Violence, encouraged virtual hearings for the courthouse moving forward.

""These actions will undermine survivors' trust in our legal system to be a resource to them and will discourage survivors from coming forward if they fear immigration will be at their next court hearing and take their loved ones,"" Pyron said.

Kuipers said she's already seen a downward trend in survivors showing up to court.

""We've been noticing that this past year that survivors from certain communities feel like it's much less likely for them to pursue legal assistance,"" she said.

Advocates said the fear caused by Wednesday's arrest won't be easily forgotten.

""It keeps people silenced, which domestic violence already inherently does; and then you add a layer of immigration status on top of that? It's silencing people, and it's keeping them in dangerous relationships, and it's making them kind of safety plan what is less dangerous – staying in an abusive relationship or potential deportation,"" Kuipers said.

Under the challenged policy, immigration courts apply mandatory detention provisions typically reserved for individuals apprehended at the border to long-term residents arrested in the interior.
The lawsuit argues this violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides different detention authorities for different categories of individuals.","AURORA, Colorado — The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a Denver immigration attorney have filed a federal class-action lawsuit challenging what they describe as an unlawful policy by immigration courts that denies bond hearings to immigrants detained in Aurora.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of Nestor Esai Mendoza Gutierrez and others similarly situated, alleges that immigration authorities have abandoned 30 years of established practice by denying bond eligibility to anyone who entered the country without permission.

""About two months ago, there was a 180-degree change in position by the immigration courts in Aurora, categorically denying anybody who ever entered the country without permission from being eligible for bond at all,"" said Hans Meyer, an immigration attorney with the Meyer Law Office who represents the plaintiff.

The policy change affects long-term U.S. residents who have been living in the country for years or decades. Mendoza Gutierrez, the named plaintiff, has resided in the Denver metro area for over 26 years, owns a construction business, has two U.S. citizen children and has applications for immigration status currently pending with the government.

According to court documents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Mendoza Gutierrez on May 25 following a false accusation that was later dismissed ""in the interest of justice"" by prosecutors. Despite his long-standing community ties, an immigration judge denied his bond request on June 23, ruling the court ""lacks jurisdiction.""

The lawsuit alleges this interpretation contradicts federal immigration law. Meyer explained that, ""for 30 years, the immigration courts have consistently interpreted the federal statute to provide people with the opportunity to seek release on bond.""

The policy shift comes from the Trump administration, and Meyer believes it's an effort to reach or inflate Trump's enforcement goal.

""The suit is to challenge what we believe is an illegitimate practice that's designed to metastasize the immigration detention system and to sort of balloon the number of people that the Trump administration can detain and coerce into taking deportations, as opposed to being able to legitimately fight their cases and maybe obtain status that they're entitled to under existing immigration law,"" Meyer said.

The practice first appeared in Tacoma, Washington. Meyer said Aurora became the second location to implement the new policy. Litigation in Tacoma successfully overturned the administration's interpretation of the statute and agreed that bond should be granted. Meyer and the ACLU hope for a similar outcome in the Colorado case.

Without access to bond hearings, detainees face prolonged detainment while their cases proceed through the immigration system.

""Categorically denying people bond can have them be stuck in detention for anywhere from a set of months to a set of years while they're waiting to get a case adjudicated,"" Meyer said.

The lawsuit argues this creates unnecessary costs for taxpayers.

""For U.S. taxpayers, we're paying corporations over $150 a day to hold a human being in detention for no ascertainable reason,"" Meyer said, speaking about the GEO Group and Core Civic, which are for-profit companies operating detention facilities.

Under the challenged policy, immigration courts apply mandatory detention provisions typically reserved for individuals apprehended at the border to long-term residents arrested in the interior. The lawsuit argues this violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides different detention authorities for different categories of individuals.

The case seeks declaratory relief establishing that class members are entitled to individualized bond determinations and requests that the court vacate the detention policies under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It is estimated that 156,000 undocumented immigrants currently reside in Colorado, with the vast majority having entered without inspection and potentially subject to the challenged policy if apprehended.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/1fdad244-8ebd-4276-aa5d-0014e5925b40/20250904T002257/1fdad244-8ebd-4276-aa5d-0014e5925b40_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:39.039514

Similar legal challenges to efforts to deport Guatemalan children are also ongoing in Arizona and Illinois.
The case now shifts from Judge Sooknanan, who was covering emergency hearings over the holiday weekend, to U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly.","Attorneys for Guatemalan migrant children in the U.S. have asked a federal court to extend a temporary ban blocking their deportation, saying that sending them to Guatemala puts them at risk of ""grave and irreparable harm."" They say that last weekend's attempt to hastily remove them in the middle of the night was a violation of their due process rights in the U.S. as well as federal law.

The 76 Guatemalan minors who came to the US unaccompanied and without legal documents were roused from their beds around 1:00 a.m. Sunday, Aug. 31, and brought by immigration authorities onto three planes. One took off, according to the children's lawyers, but turned around after a federal district court judge temporarily blocked their deportation. Attorneys with the National Immigration Law Center who sought that temporary restraining order over the holiday weekend, made a new request Wednesday for a longer-term injunction.

What do we know about these children?

New court papers offer details about the minors, their circumstances of abuse and neglect in their native Guatemala, and their ""harrowing experience during the weekend attempt to deport them from the U.S.

According to court filings a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy says he was awakened at 2 am, was very scared, lost his breath and started to pray. Another says simply she was ""totally traumatized."" One young girl was so scared that she vomited, according to an unidentified witness cited in the papers.

Many of the minors explain why they are ""terrified"" by the prospect of returning to Guatemala after having been threatened by gang members, for example, or having been a victim of human trafficking.

Several share details of ""abuse and neglect"" from family members and one describes how she ""suffered from physical and emotional abuse"" from both her parents.

""They hit me with a belt, with their hands and with sticks, and sometimes I would bleed,"" she stated. ""I fear that if I were to return to Guatemala my life would end.""

Another, who identifies as LGBTQ expressed fear of being raped and forced into a marriage, and stated ""If I had to return to Guatemala, I would kill myself.""

""In the dead of night on a holiday weekend, the Trump administration ripped vulnerable frightened children from their beds and attempted to return them to danger in Guatemala,"" said Efren Olivares, a lead attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.

The judge said her order applied to all Guatemalan minors being held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which could be as many as 700 children.

Why are they being deported?

The U.S. government says the Guatemalan families of the unaccompanied young migrants sought their return. The Guatemalan government has said it proposed a repatriation plan to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in June. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said to reporters on Monday that he wanted to prevent vulnerable children from being sent to ICE detention centers. Arevalo said that his officials have ""toured detention centers for Guatemalans"" and were very concerned for the young migrants.

Trump administration officials have denounced the judge's order stopping the deportations.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, wrote on X that the move blocks ""flights to *reunify* Guatemalan children with their families. Now these children have to go to shelters. This is disgusting and immoral.""

Lawyers for the minors dismiss that as a ""false narrative.""

""If these are benign repatriations,"" says Olivares, waking kids up in the middle of the night with no notice, ""is not how that would have happened.""

What is the legal case against the deportations?

Immigration defense lawyers say the move was a blatant violation of the minors' due process rights, as well as immigration and federal laws which entitle the minors to a full opportunity to challenge their removals. They accuse the Trump administration of ""flouting their legal obligations"" to unaccompanied children that were passed by Congress, due to minors' ""unique and vulnerable situation.""

""This is not the government doing international family reunification. It's not repatriation,"" said Gladis Molina, executive director of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights -- one of several advocates who briefed congressional staffers about the case on Tuesday.

""This is the government trying to put on a veil of legal authority to something that is completely violating international and domestic law,"" said Molina ""It's the turning back of people that are seeking protection under international and domestic asylum law.""

Similar legal challenges to efforts to deport Guatemalan children are also ongoing in Arizona and Illinois.

What does the judge's initial ruling mean?

U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's early morning emergency order imposed a 14-day freeze on the deportations

Sooknanan ordered the government to ""cease any ongoing efforts to transfer, remove or otherwise facilitate the transport"" of the minors, noting, ""I do not want there to be any ambiguity about what I am ordering.""

In a similar incident in March, a judge attempted to stop the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador. Despite the judge's order, government officials did not turn the planes around midflight.

What happens now?

The case now shifts from Judge Sooknanan, who was covering emergency hearings over the holiday weekend, to U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly. Kelly will hear more arguments from lawyers for both sides.

Lawyers for the Trump administration must file an opposition to the request for an injunction by Sept. 6, and the next court hearing is set for Sept. 10.

Olivares says he and other attorneys will use ""every legal tool … to force the administration to respect the law and not send a child into danger.""

""The Constitution and federal laws provide robust protection to unaccompanied minors specifically because of the unique risks they face,"" he said.

Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.","OMAHA — Again on Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s effort to deny bond to workers detained and facing deportation proceedings following their arrest in Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid.

This time, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon presided over a combined hearing in Omaha for three undocumented workers. His decision mirrored that of similar Glenn Valley cases he had ruled on the past several weeks.

Bataillon found that the government was violating due process rights of all three by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of a bond an immigration judge earlier had determined was appropriate.

He ordered the detainees to be immediately released upon reposting the respective bond amounts that weeks ago had been set by an immigration judge, but then were swiftly challenged by the federal government.

The three — Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, Diego Palma Perez and Ernesto Cortes Fernandez — were among about 75 Glenn Valley plant workers arrested during a June 10 workforce enforcement operation led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE described the operation as a “federal criminal investigation into over 100 cases of stolen identities.” But the three in court Wednesday have faced no criminal charges, their lawyers said. They face administrative offenses and deportation for allegedly being in the country without authorization.

Federal attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE challenged the bonds based on new July 8 guidance from the Trump administration that looks to end bond hearings for almost all undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation.

That mandatory detention guidance hangs on a section of immigration law applied historically to newly arrived migrants, not those who, like the Glenn Valley workers, already had been in the U.S. for years, even if they entered without authorization.

Bataillon noted that ICE had arrested the Glenn Valley workers under one provision of the law, but then government attorneys wanted to hold them under the different section of law that applied to migrants who just arrived.

Attorney Christopher Ferretti, representing the feds, said during the hearing that his team still asserts that no-bond should apply. Given “short shrift” in the discussion he said, is the government’s interest in “controlling its borders.”

Jamie Arango, a Lincoln immigration attorney representing two of the Glenn Valley workers Wednesday, said the government’s strategy to prolong detention can drive some migrants to self-deport.

“It’s depriving them of due process,” she said.

Arango said family commitments led her clients to endure more than two months in a North Platte jail. Both have several children, she said, and have been in the country working for decades. “They didn’t want to leave their families behind.”

After release on bond, the migrants’ legal teams still must build cases as to why their clients should be able to remain in the U.S.

Arango said she represents another Glenn Valley worker in a similar situation, awaiting a federal hearing.

Arango said there are numerous people like her clients in Nebraska and across the country. “They’re not letting anyone out on bond,” she said, adding that it is clogging up the immigration justice system.

Grant Friedman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, who represented Carmona-Lorenzo, said the ACLU has at least one more client arrested in the Glenn Valley raid awaiting a similar hearing.

Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.

Carmona-Lorenzo had been in the U.S. for more than 20 years when she was detained in June, her lawyers said. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors, one is in college, and the other serves in the military.

The Glenn Valley workers’ lawyers challenged the prolonged detention in federal civil rights lawsuits that argue the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on a bond.

“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.

ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid should be on American “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by migrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
