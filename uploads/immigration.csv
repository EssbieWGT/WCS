St. Susanna's pastor, Fr. Stephen Josoma, and the archbishop have been at odds over the ""ICE was here"" nativity scene that the parish's Pax Christi group erected at the beginning of Advent last month.

The archdiocese criticized the scene, which includes a sign saying the Holy Family is ""safe in the sanctuary of our church,"" as ""divisive political messaging."" The statement added: ""The display should be removed and the manger restored to its proper sacred purpose.""

Josoma says the scene is meant to depict ""Incarnation, 2025,"" adding: ""It reflects the context that Jesus would be coming into if he were born today.""

After the archdiocese issued its statement Dec. 5, Josoma said the display would remain as-is until he has a conversation with the archbishop. Josoma said in a telephone interview Dec. 16 that he hoped that would happen in the next couple of days.

He said there's ""no animosity"" between him and Henning and that he looks forward to the conversation.

Terrence Donilon, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said on Dec. 19 that he had ""no update"" on the situation.

What's the truth of Christ's birth that we need to focus on today?

Just over a year after succeeding Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Henning has the chance to surprise his flock with an inspiring move: He could show up at St. Susanna's on Sunday, admit he was wrong to issue such a dismissive criticism, and learn more about what prompted the display in the first place.

A long shot? Probably. But maybe Henning is more inclined to listen than people give him credit for.

When he arrived at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross for his installation as archbishop of Boston last year, he was approached by survivors of clergy sexual abuse. They asked him if he would talk with them.

He approached them and said: ""I'm very sorry, I have to learn. I have to listen.""

His dustup with St. Susanna's presents Henning with a chance to do some of both. And there's nothing like an apology to serve as a gateway to getting at the truth.

That truth — of what this church's nativity scene is really about — brings us to a core principle of Catholic social teaching: subsidiarity.

Subsidiarity is the principle that decisions and actions should happen at the lowest, most local, competent level possible, with higher authorities only stepping in to offer support. That is especially relevant to a parish's work on behalf of immigrants in its midst along with the nativity scene it builds in front of its church.

Both the archdiocese and the parish have done considerable work on behalf of immigrants, with the archdiocese's Catholic Charities operation focused on issues of resettlement, housing and legal defense and the parish focused on support for individual immigrant families.

The parish also supports the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts known as LUCE, which helps warn undocumented people of possible raids by ICE.

A sign beneath the empty crib in the parish nativity sign reads: ""If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.""

The idea of a nativity scene is to help believers imagine as much of the truth of Christ's birth as possible.

Historians trace the first nativity scene to 1223, when St. Francis is said to have set one up in Italy. As Slate reported in 2012:

… The only historical account we have of Francis' nativity scene comes from The Life of St. Francis of Assisi by St. Bonaventure, a Franciscan monk who was born five years before Francis' death.

According to Bonaventure's biography, St. Francis got permission from Pope Honorious III to set up a manger with hay and two live animals — an ox and an ass — in a cave in the Italian village of Grecio. He then invited the villagers to come gaze upon the scene while he preached about ""the babe of Bethlehem.""

The Gospels of Luke and Matthew provide limited accounts of Christ's birth, but each provides some basis for St. Susanna's embellishments. Luke reports that, with no room in the inn, the family was turned away. Matthew casts the Holy Family as refugees, hoping to escape the scourge of King Herod.

Those two Gospels were written 80 to 90 years after Christ's birth, of course, so it's best to look to them more for symbolic truths as opposed to historical fact.

St. Susanna's has explored those truths in various ways in recent years, creating nativity scenes highlighting the climate crisis (Jesus floating in water filled with plastic bottles), family separation (Jesus in a cage) and gun violence (a list of mass shootings).

All of which sets the stage for a discussion Henning could have with the parishioners of St. Susanna's: What's the truth of Christ's birth that we need to focus on today?

What have parishioners heard from people who may be undocumented and fear being picked up by ICE? What are some of the ways parishioners are working with immigrants? How might the archdiocese be more helpful to those efforts?

Earlier this month, Henning visited four parishes in the archdiocese as part of a novena to Our Lady of Guadalupe, often regarded as the spiritual guardian of migrants. Why not pay a visit to St. Susanna's with that same inspiration in mind?

Henning chaired the committee that drafted the statement about ICE enforcement that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued Nov. 12 at their meeting in Baltimore. He's the lead voice in a video montage of bishops speaking up on behalf of immigrants:

As pastors, we the bishops of the United States are bound to our people by ties of communion and compassion in our Lord Jesus Christ. And we are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.

In its editorial following the bishops' statement last month, NCR asked: ""What about real action?""

The parishioners of St. Susanna's have been taking real action. Their bishop should go learn from them.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-12/12.21.25%20Ice%20was%20here.JPG?h=82f92a78&itok=4Zjzv2wB,N,,2025-12-21 10:57:03.547040

Once detained, immigrants are held without a sentence, without knowing when they might be released or deported.","One in a series detailing how Trump's immigration policies are transforming America.

It was a Trump-era international love story: Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl gets detained by ICE.

But the detention of the Lithuania-born Tatjana Vesiolko is an unusual one, even in an era of increasingly strict immigration enforcement. She is entering her 11th month in an immigration lock-up. Al Dallasta, her American fiancé, can't understand why.

""She's essentially lost a year of her life for what?"" Dallasta said of his partner – a billiards champ, slender with a chestnut bob who friends call ""Tia"" for short. ""She's falling apart in there.""

The day President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, he signed seven executive orders that set the stage for a surge in immigration enforcement across the country. Vesiolko was among the first to be swept up in the administration's mass deportation campaign.

The Trump administration is now detaining more immigrants than at any time since World War II. As of Nov. 30, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported a record 65,735 people in immigration detention.

Deportation flights have become more frequent. But the proportion and number of people like Vesiolko, detained longer than six months, is climbing.

Two years ago, according to ICE data, about 1,300 people or 4% of the detained population, had been held for more than 180 days. That number rose to 6,500 people, or 10% of the detained population, in November ‒ Vesiolko among them.

She entered on a visa waiver in 2009 and stayed, without permission. She has no criminal record, holds a valid Lithuanian passport and comes from a country that accepts its nationals. Immigration attorneys say there are no obvious barriers to her removal.

Provided with the details of her case, the Department of Homeland Security sent a statement: ""The delay of her removal was because of the illegal alien's potential inclusion as a member of a class action lawsuit.""

DHS didn't name the lawsuit or respond to USA TODAY's questions for clarification. Dallasta said Vesiolko was never told she might part of a lawsuit, nor was she given a chance to opt out.

Vesiolko's prolonged detention may also be ""a symptom of ICE working in overdrive,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for immigration restrictions.

""There is no question that ICE and its partners have been making more arrests than can be efficiently processed for removal,"" she said. ""It sounds like a case of someone who slipped through the cracks.""

Vesiolko, desperate to be out by Christmas, decided to share her story. She spoke to USA TODAY by phone: ""Is this just a mean mistake?"" she asked. ""Have they lost my file?""

Boy meets girl

Before he met Vesiolko, Dallasta, born and raised in Philadelphia, believed a few things with certainty.

That the Eagles are the greatest team in the National Football League. That he would never live on the New Jersey side of the Pennsylvania state line. That he wouldn't likely travel abroad. He had no reason to.

He was a year out of a 14-year marriage that ended in divorce when he logged on to Facebook Dating in 2024.

He and Vesiolko exchanged messages for a few days until she fell silent. Assuming she was done with him, he sent a farewell message telling her she was beautiful and wishing her luck. They met that same night for a date at a Chickie & Pete's pub in New Jersey.

For the next six months, they were inseparable – until agents detained Vesiolko at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The couple was returning from their first vacation together. It was Valentine's Day.

He vividly recalls her being pulled aside at the airport: the shock, and the foregone conclusion, when a federal agent told him Vesiolko would be deported. They imagined she would be headed to Lithuania within days.

At home, without her, he broke down crying in the kitchen. She had left him a Valentine's card.

He read it alone.

""There are so many paths life can take,"" she wrote. ""The fact that you and I found each other in a whole world of people is not a coincidence.""

The cost of detention is counted in many ways

Vesiolko has now spent 311 days in custody.

The months have been hard on both of them. Vesiolko, 38, struggles to keep her spirits up; she was a runner and now gets precious little time outside. Dallasta, 43, battles anxiety, which has worsened with Vesiolko's detention. He recently resigned from his job as a safety associate for a major home improvement chain.

With no end in sight to his fiancé's detention, Dallasta tallied up the personal financial costs.

Some $22,000 in fees to immigration attorneys. Another $2,000 in commissary costs. Precisely $6,370 in phone calls to the detention center. His life savings.

Vesiolko counts the costs in holidays missed, dinners she didn't cook, trips they didn't take. And the guilt of what her detention has done to Dallasta.

Her detention is also costing American taxpayers.

The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute calculates that immigration detention costs an average of $152 per detainee, per day. ICE data shows detainees with immigration violations and no criminal record are spending, on average, 48 days in detention.

Past presidential administrations had focused immigration enforcement on violent criminals. Though Trump promised to arrest ""the worst of the worst,"" the mass deportation effort has put all immigrants here without legal documentation at risk for detention and deportation.

After her arrest in Puerto Rico, Vesiolko was sent to Richwood Correctional Center in northern Louisiana.

Over the ensuing months, she made bids to stay in the United States. Because she had entered on a waiver – and such visitors are held to a higher standard of conduct – she was ineligible for bond. ICE didn't respond to her request for humanitarian parole, Dallasta said.

One immigration judge denied her asylum claim, and another issued a final order of removal in June.

She didn't fight it. Dallasta mailed in her passport to ICE.

Dallasta planned to meet her in Lithuania. They imagined a new life in Europe, marrying and applying for Vesiolko to return to the United States as the spouse of an American.

""Before all this happened, I knew I wanted to be with her,"" Dallasta said.

Hope and 'habeas'

Sunday, Dec. 21, marks 180 days from the day her final deportation order took effect. It's also the day the law cracks open a window to potential relief.

Immigration attorneys say Vesiolko could now file what's known as a ""habeas"" petition, a formal legal request asking a court to review the legality of her detention. She doesn't have a lawyer – they're both nearly out of money now – and she has pleaded with her deportation officer to let her buy her own ticket home.

""When people volunteer to pay their own ticket, and they don't have a crime, there's no reason they're not on that commercial airline,"" headed to their native country, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is not involved in her case.

Under the law, immigration detention operates outside the norms of criminal incarceration.

Immigrants can be detained, indefinitely, without charge. They may hire an attorney but don't have access to government-appointed representation. Once detained, immigrants are held without a sentence, without knowing when they might be released or deported. Immigration judges, which the Trump administration has started calling ""deportation judges,"" are hired and can be fired.

But habeas petitions are a long shot in Louisiana right now, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. Judges often allow the government to say, ""We're working on it,"" and immigrants remain detained, sometimes for months longer.

Ahmed said detention is key to the Trump administration's messaging. ""This is about, 'If you dare come, you better expect you will be subjected to punishment.'""

In response to a request about Vesiolko's extended detention, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told USA TODAY immigrants have the option to ""self-deport.""

The administration's self-deportation campaign, featuring $1,000 bonuses to immigrants who leave willingly, began in early March, after Vesiolko was detained.

'I have a life out of here'

Vesiolko arrived in America from Moscow with $100 in her pocket and the knowledge that her father – a veteran of Russia's armed forces who hated the United States – would never forgive her.

""When I came here, my father found out and I was scared to go back,"" she said. ""He is a very radical Russian, against America. Everything about America triggers him. I had nowhere to go back.""

She had grown up in Moscow, with her father, his family and her Lithuanian mother.

At age 21, after her parents' messy divorce, she fled to New Jersey, where a friend had relocated. She learned American English.

The years snowballed. Vesiolko worked as a housekeeper, under the table. (Homeland Security noted, ""She freely admitted to being in the country illegally and never filing taxes."") She joined a local pool league, made friends and built an American life.

""Every bar with a pool table, people know me,"" she said.

When she met Dallasta for a first date, she asked him to meet her at a pub where she didn't think she'd run into people she knew.

""But right away, friends spotted me and said, 'Hey pool shark! Be careful with her!' It was a funny first date.""

Now they talk five times a day on pricey detention center phone lines and via 30-cents-per-minute video calls.

She calls Dallasta ""sweet cheeks."" When he started calling her ""freckles,"" she taught him the Russian. Now he says, 'Good night, moya venushka."" My little freckle.

""He reminds me that I have a future,"" she said. ""That I have a life out of here. He reminds me that I am loved.""

The months have dragged on.

Vesiolko has watched other immigrant women come and go, be released or deported. Most of the ones detained long-term with her are there, she says, because they are fighting to stay in the United States. She isn't.

Without knowing how much longer she'll be inside, how much longer before she'll see Dallasta face to face, she holds on to an idea from her mother's Catholicism.

That the seemingly endless detention is a penance.

""If that's the price I pay for being with the love of my life, I can pay that price,"" she said. ""Because I know, after this, I'm going to be so happy.""

Those who help people navigate the nation’s convoluted immigration system say the administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants has brought them a rush of new clients even as it has made it harder to help them.

“It’s a whole different world top to bottom,” said John “Jack” Pinnix, a longtime Raleigh immigration attorney and former national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). “It was never a good climate because of a poor court system and horrible backlogs. All that existed before Trump, but Trump has exacerbated it incredibly. It’s a lot nastier, too.”

Immigration law is not among the most lucrative legal practices. Many lawyers in the field do it out of sense of service. But that commitment also adds to the tension as some of their clients face deportation and family separations.

“The stress level is just out of sight,” Pinnix said. “You can’t get some immigration cases out of your mind. You lose one of those and the family is gone.”

Andres Lopez, a Charlotte immigration attorney who works out of the same building that houses the state’s only federal immigration court, said he feels that stress daily. Lopez, who came to the U.S. as a child and is a naturalized citizen, said, “It’s a secondary trauma” to represent clients in a system that now seems intent on deporting as many people as possible.

“We have to represent clients who are fleeing for their lives from situations that are awful. To see clients be dehumanized, humiliated, it certainly has an emotional effect on you as an attorney,” he said.

The Trump administration has fired about 100 of 715 immigration judges, who are employed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Some have been replaced by military judges who are less familiar with immigration law and less inclined to rule against the administration as it seeks to ramp up deportations.

“This administration cares more about numbers than they care about justice,” Lopez said. “It’s all about power, in a way it’s about abusing power and getting away with it.”

Jeremy McKinney, a Greensboro immigration attorney and also a former AILA president, said all areas of the immigration system are now focused on cracking down on undocumented immigrants.

“It’s never been worse because they have turned all the different facets of immigration into one big enforcement apparatus,” he said.

McKinney said federal immigration officers are approaching civil violations with criminal intensity as they round up people suspected of being in the nation illegally.

“You don’t apply force, you don’t need to carry assault rifles, you don’t need to cause traffic accidents to enforce a civil code,” he said. “This is all complete insanity.”

A recent sweep by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents in the greater Charlotte led to the arrest of more than 425 people. McKinney said the numbers would have been higher if immigration advocacy groups and immigration attorneys had not pushed back.

“My goodness, our bar, we have filed dozens and dozens of lawsuits against the federal government challenging their actions,” he said. “At this point, I think my office has sued the federal government at least once a week for the last seven weeks.”

President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” provides billions of additional dollars for immigration law enforcement. But McKinney thinks having masked agents who refuse to identify themselves round up people who are not criminals and sometimes are U.S. citizens can’t continue.

“It’s completely unacceptable to have renegade, masked secret police roaming our streets,” he said. “It’s fundamentally un-American. I think that most people are not going to put up with it anymore.”

What needs to be done, he said, is “Congress has to figure out how to do hard things again” and reform the nation’s immigration laws. Rights need to be clarified, case backlogs cut, paths to citizenship opened and immigration quotas adjusted.

“Somewhere down the line there’s got to be enough of a consensus that we can fix this system and protect the American people and protect American jobs and still be pro-businesses and get this done,” McKinney said. “There has just got to be the willpower to do it.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/public/latest-news/w89s40/picture312963722/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CLT_BORDER_MONDAY_05.JPG,N,,2025-12-21 09:57:16.003241

ICE stated that “one death occurred on December 12, two more on December 14, and the fourth on December 15,” adding that two people died of natural causes, while the other two died of medical complications.

This is the highest number since 2004. The news, confirmed by an ICE press release, has reopened the debate on the conditions in which immigrants are detained while awaiting trial or deportation.

ICE stated that “one death occurred on December 12, two more on December 14, and the fourth on December 15,” adding that two people died of natural causes, while the other two died of medical complications. They are Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian who was arrested by ICE on December 11 and died the next day at Delaney Hall in Newark; Nenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old Bulgarian who died at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan; Delvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Nicaraguan detained in Natchez, Mississippi; and Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean who died at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.

The increase in deaths is mainly due to overcrowding. There are currently around 66,000 people (a record number) being held in relatively small facilities scattered across the United States. ICE lists 131 official centers, but data suggests that between 190 and 400 are being used, including state and local jails and private prisons. Detainees often find themselves without beds, showers, adequate medical care, or quality food because the network is not equipped to accommodate thousands of immigrants every day. The lack of oversight makes the situation even worse. The Trump administration has closed at least two federal agencies that were responsible for oversight and continues to claim that “detainees are in good conditions.”

“There has been NO spikes in deaths,” Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post. “As bed space has expanded, we have maintained higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens—including providing access to proper medical care.”

Representatives of human rights non-profits, lawyers for some detained immigrants, and several congressmen denounce the deterioration of these facilities. “Four detainee deaths in one week is a red-hot crisis,” commented Eunice Cho, senior counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.",https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 10:56:55.010855
