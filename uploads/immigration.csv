Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006.
My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business.
“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said.","On Dec. 10, Sayyid Akbarov was studying for his final exams when he heard something that made his stomach drop:

His father, Saydullo, was detained by federal immigration officials during a visit to Philadelphia.

Saydullo Akbarov, 42, who lives near Schuylkill Haven with his wife and four children, was at a Department of Homeland Security facility for an biannual checkup that morning, his son said.

What should have been a routine visit completed over a few hours led to him being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to Sayyid, 19.

Saydullo, a native of Uzbekistan, was later moved to the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Centre County, where he remains.

Saydullo owns and operates a local trucking business, Wild Stallion LLC, which has stalled in his absence, Sayyid said.

Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006. They have raised all four of their children in the county — Sayyid, a former wrestling star at Blue Mountain High School, and his three younger sisters.

It has been a tough two weeks for the Akbarovs as they navigate life without their patriarch, whom they describe as a devoted citizen and community member.

“It’s a surprise when a complying person like that — he’s not on the run, he’s not a fugitive, he’s a business owner, complies with all the rules, has no criminal history, no record — is detained like that,” Sayyid said. “It’s surprising to see something like that happen.”

Sayyid said he and his family are discouraged because there is no legal recourse they can seek at this point. The Akbarovs were advised by a lawyer that they must wait around six months before they can take action and try to have Saydullo released, he said.

“From what the lawyer is saying, we have to wait a minimum of six months before we can reopen the case and get him out,” Sayyid said. “We don’t want to wait that long. … That’s the question we’re all asking right now — what can we do to get him out?

“We don’t want him to sit in there for six months. We’re doing everything we can. We’ve reached out to congressmen, we reached out to people to see if they can get him out, see if they can take some action on their end. We’ve talked to many lawyers, we’ve talked to people, family friends to see if they can have any pull. But unfortunately, we’ve come up short.”

Sayyid said that his father, over the past 19 years, has built a life as “a perfectly good resident who pays his taxes, clean record, no criminal history, has a business, has four kids, productive citizen and community leader.”

“In reality, he is the picture perfect American person,” Sayyid said. “ … He was not given the American dream — he earned it, worked for it — and with God’s grace, he was able to get it and fulfill the American dream. Isn’t that what this is all about? Isn’t that why people immigrate to the U.S., so they can have a better life?

“They want to take it all away. Twenty years being in the country, for nothing. They want him to start from scratch all over again, in a different country. Not only that, they want to drag a family apart. They want to drag him away from the community. His shoes are too big to fill.”

Sayyid, a sophomore track-and-field athlete at Lehigh University, said he felt overwhelmed when his mother called him on Dec. 10 to tell him about his father’s detainment. Stressed out after a rigorous semester at school — and simultaneously fighting through an illness — Sayyid was studying for his finals in a cafe in Philadelphia when he heard the news.

“When he was detained, I was thrown into the fire,” he said. “It was during finals week — I had my first final the day after he was detained. So I couldn’t concentrate on the finals, I didn’t do as well as I hoped to — and at the same time, the business needs, when he was (detained), I had to run the entire operation. At the same time while studying, visiting lawyers, prepping the paperwork, processing all this information. Just a lot to do during a small period of time.”

After he was taken into custody at the DHS facility, Saydullo was processed at a Philadelphia detention center. Officials then moved him to long-term custody at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, Sayyid said.

Saydullo is active on the board of directors at the Islamic Society of Schuylkill County. Sayyid said his father has spearheaded the construction of many important amenities there, such as a parking lot and an accessible ramp that leads directly to the prayer hall.

He said his father orchestrates many other aspects of the mosque’s operations.

“He’s not just a business owner, not just a family member, but he’s also a community leader,” Sayyid said. “We rely on him here every day. … What he built and what he contributed to this mosque is really important.”

Sayyid said he and his uncle have helped out with Wild Stallion LLC, trying to “keep it somewhat open, somewhat alive,” but he said the business is unable to operate normally and stay solvent without Saydullo.

“We’re working with lawyers to see if we can get some sort of petition going for him,” Sayyid said. “There’s little to nothing we can do legally other than wait. … I can’t run the business, I’m a student athlete. My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business. People are going to lose their jobs.”

Beyond their personal relationship, Sayyid believes his father’s livelihood and his efforts for the community are too valuable to be removed all at once, after nearly two decades of positive contributions.

“Nothing positive is being gained,” Sayyid said. “Yeah, you removed a perfectly good resident, and there’s one less immigrant in the country. But is that really a positive to society? Is that what the country really wants for people? … It just doesn’t make any sense.”

Community leader

Those who know Saydullo Akbarov describe him as a hard-working, dedicated person who can be counted on to help out his community.

“People rely on him to get things done, for help, for everything,” Sayyid said. “That’s his place in the community.”

Dr. Mohammad Masood Akbar, a local ENT, said he was “really shocked” when he heard the news about Saydullo, whom he has known for several years.

“It’s going to be a big loss for our community,” said Akbar, who serves as vice president of the Islamic Society.

Among Saydullo’s many attributes, Akbar singled out his skill as a handyman, noting he can address any sort of community or mosque-related construction project.

“He is the ideal person you could have as a friend, a family member,” he said.

Alaedin Alamari, a longtime friend of Saydullo’s, said he is missed by everyone in the community.

“He’s a really good man,” Alamari said. “He’d give a hand for everybody. You miss him here. Everybody needs him here with us.”

Zachariah Hnesh, of Pottsville, said that Saydullo’s impact extends far beyond the mosque.

“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said. “He’s helped coach youth wrestling. He’s done all these different services for the community. He’s employed local people, he’s an entrepreneur, he’s raised a beautiful family. … Just an all-around stand-up guy. He’s helped in so many different capacities.”",https://www.republicanherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RHR-L-AKBAROV-1227-0-16x9-1.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:51.686632

What makes this winter storm unique from previous ones this season will be the abundance of warm air aloft, melting snow into rain.
It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.
Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight.
Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week.","The Latest Storm Tracker Forecast from Meteorologist Kevin Appleby:

After a chilly night, the daytime hours of Sunday will be rather cloudy, but dry & uneventful. Things change quickly Sunday night after 5 PM. Very warm air will be present aloft, but sub-freezing temperatures at the surface will create an environment ripe for ice, especially in northern areas into Monday morning. We then change years with a stretch of below average temperatures.

It will be frigid overnight thanks to partly clear skies, lack of wind, and a fresh snow pack in wake of Friday evening’s snow. Lows will be in the single digits, with some subzero readings expected in the hills and mountains.

Temperatures will gradually warm Sunday. But after such a cold start, temperatures regionwide will be below freezing at the onset of precipitation Sunday evening.

What makes this winter storm unique from previous ones this season will be the abundance of warm air aloft, melting snow into rain. However, with subfreezing temperatures locked in at the surface, this rain will freeze on contact with roads, walkways, powerlines, sidewalks – you name it.

Our storm is still getting its act together over the center of the country, but it will carry with it a strong cold front that, one is passes through Monday afternoon, will increase our winds and bring in much colder air for the remainder of the forecast.

Winter Weather Advisories are up across the board for the anticipated ice, but not all advisories are created equally! Mohawk Valley-southbound, the Advisory is in effect through 4 AM, when temperatures should be above freezing. However, in the North Country, the colder air at the surface will be a bit more stubborn, so the Advisory is in effect through 10 AM. It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.

As mentioned, area-wide, this is almost entirely ice at the onset. There won’t be any sleet or any snow with this system. Temperatures will gradually warm thanks to an increasing south wind, allowing a changeover to plain rain generally form south to north.

By 6 AM Monday, the Capital Region and points south should be above freezing, with some even close to 40 degrees by then. However, sub-freezing temperatures may persist to the north. Beyond 10 AM, temperatures will be above freezing, and the rest of the daytime hours will feature scattered rain showers. Behind the cold front as temperatures at the surface and aloft plummet Monday evening and a gusty westerly wind kicks in, lake effect snow showers and flurries are expected.

Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight. Locally, I think we see a tenth of an inch or more of ice accretion. Remember, with ice, it only takes a glaze to create hazardous driving conditions! But up north, where as much as a half an inch of ice is possible, that is where there is a growing concern for power outages into Monday morning. Highest confidence in these higher ice amounts exists over much of the Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, and Saratoga Region, with some similar amounts possible within sheltered valleys of the Green Mountains in Vermont.

Temperatures should actually spike into the lower 40s Monday afternoon (mid to upper 30s in the areas with a higher ice accretion forecast), but will quickly drop Monday evening as another shot of arctic air filters in. On top of temperatures struggling to rise far above 20 degrees Tuesday afternoon, winds may gust as high as 50 MPH. That could also create for some power outages, but also keeps wind chill values in the single digits (below zero in the high spots). And, since these winds are off of the Great Lakes (specifically Lake Ontario), accumulating snow is expected, with plowable snowfall totals through Wednesday expected in parts of the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks.

The breeze eases up Wednesday, but it will remain out of the west-northwest, thus continuing lake effect snow showers and flurries. Another wave of low pressure will slide near the region late Thursday, possibly producing a quick shot of light snow. Into next weekend, it will be colder than average, but dry conditions are favored both Friday and Saturday at this time.

Cannot say the same for next Sunday as some guidance suggests another winter storm is possible – one that would have all precip types associated with it. Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week. Clouds hang around next Monday. More sun is possible by Tuesday, but that may be accompanied by colder temperatures.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2022/09/STORM-TRACKER_WEATHER-alert-snow-parking-dig-plow-3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:58.795498

Scenes this summer of a synchronized fleet of Ukrainian drones descending on a field of Russian warplanes punctuate just how far we’ve pivoted from classic artillery and infantry-based operations. It’s not only the methods that are changing, but increasingly the targets. What will come next will be clandestine, remote hacking attacks supercharged by AI and targeted (or errant) munitions that sever broadband lines and incinerate internet infrastructure. And with data center development and the internet’s reach continuing to quickly accelerate worldwide, this shift should worry us all — because the primary victims of new age digital warfare will be vast civilian populations, and the toll will be catastrophic.

One need only look at Gaza to understand just how damaging these disruptions can be. According to a report from Access Now, Gaza experienced at least 27 complete or partial internet and telecommunications outages since Israel’s assault on the territory began in October 2023. The most recent shutdown, this past September, preceded an Israeli ground invasion with tanks and infantry.

Whether due to intentional sabotage or negligence, these actions have greatly hindered emergency responses and the coordination and delivery of services and resources, including food and water for besieged Gazans.

Concerns about attacks via or against the internet aren’t isolated to active conflict zones. Seventy-five percent of Americans are concerned about the safety of the country’s internet infrastructure, and it’s not hard to understand why. In the roughly two decades that the internet has been more or less ubiquitous in the U.S., the technology has evolved from being a novelty to being critical in how we perform our work, socialize, manage our finances and stay informed.

For most of us, the idea of an internet outage is mildly panic-inducing, plunging us into an experience that feels akin to temporarily losing one of our senses. But compare that with people in countries confronted by this new era of cyber- and internet infrastructure attacks, where internet disruptions are a recurrent reality. Civilian life, if not the target, is frequently among the collateral damage.

Somewhere around 5.5 billion people, roughly 68% of the world’s population, now use the internet. That’s more than double the number from just a decade ago, with the internet essential to how contemporary society and its institutions function. It’s used by hospitals and nonprofits to deliver healthcare and social services. It’s used by the government to make commercial travel and traffic safer. It helps coordinate the byzantine supply chains that fuel our economies. It even helps monitor and upkeep our communities’ water and energy infrastructure.

Because of how central the internet is to even these most basic functions, efforts to deliberately disrupt or terminate internet access reflect clear violations of human rights. And in a growing number of cases around the world, the violations are a clear matter of life and death. Yet there has been little international response to the increasing use of attacks on internet infrastructure in regions that are embroiled in explicit and covert war.

At multiple points over the last decade, undersea cables have been deliberately severed or otherwise sabotaged by antagonist actors. Last year, two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, one linking Germany and Finland, were ruptured, presumably by Russian saboteurs. And this past March, the Peace Submarine Cable, connecting Africa, Asia and Europe, was cut, causing widespread internet outages in East Africa. No cause has been officially determined.

Last year, many Americans got a direct taste of just how much an internet blackout could affect our daily lives. A global internet outage in July 2024 caused by lapses from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, affected 26% of U.S. adults. The unintentional outage crippled financial services, delayed flights and led to disruptions of operations at hospitals and businesses across the world. So what happens when bad actors, including our own governments, intentionally, with even more precision and resources at their disposal, target our internet and threaten our ability to stay connected?

In October 2024, the Taliban instituted a broad internet shutdown in Afghanistan under the dubious pretext of addressing internet “misuse,” restoring it shortly after widespread condemnation. But this is far from the first instance of the internet being weaponized by internal forces. Following the example of Iran, Sudan, Bahrain, Egypt and Syria have cut off or suppressed internet access to stymie protesters, with varying degrees of success.

In a particularly troubling development that may signal broader trends, Russia has recently been testing a way to cut its territories off from the global internet as a way of building its own “sovereign” network — one that could allow the Kremlin to more directly surveil civilians and quash political dissent.

In 2016, the Human Rights Council of the United Nations formally declared access to the internet a human right. But like most of its pronouncements, enforceability and accountability aren’t guaranteed or widely expected. A handful of countries, each with deeply autocratic leanings — Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India — have opposed UN amendments aimed at codifying the internet as a human right.

To earnestly make internet access a human right, it’s important that we define precisely what constitutes access, having a clear focus on an internet that is reliable and sufficiently fast. For example, although 5G was widely available in Israel in 2020, the Israeli government has long denied Palestinians access to 4G service, relenting to upgrades in 2021 that still have not fully come to fruition as they should have.

We also must recognize that human rights are often linked, with one essential to others. For example, internet access is increasingly connected to the quality of one’s education, a more globally recognized and embraced human right. According to one international survey, roughly 39% of internet users use it for education or study-related purposes. Internet access is also intimately connected to the ability to engage in free speech and to work, two other vital human rights.

While these kinds of infringements may seem unlikely to come to American shores, various forms of internet throttling and indirect censorship already broadly occur in the country. Owing to ongoing Republican politicking, the U.S. is behind on ensuring net neutrality, a principle that says all internet traffic should be treated equally and not subjected to the biases and financial spoils of tiered access. According to a CNET poll, last year, 42% of U.S. adults said they experienced unreliable internet speeds or connectivity, and 63% saw their home internet prices increase.

With digital connectivity increasingly determining access to basic needs, the case for earnestly treating internet access as a human right has never been clearer. Like warfare, our understanding of human rights has to evolve with the times. This means understanding that in future warfare, victory won’t be measured just in terms of adversaries eliminated, but also by the depth of destruction of the internet infrastructure that sustains our societies.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40b6a37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F05%2Fb4b2709e442986dee23ea256f460%2Ftaiwan-undersea-cable-80958.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:42.695117

What America Might Look Like With Zero Immigration

The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the foreign-born population are being felt in hospitals and soccer leagues and on Main Streets across the country, with hints of what’s to come.

Dec. 28, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ET

Across the United States, someone is missing.

One year into President Trump’s immigration crackdown, construction firms in Louisiana are scrambling to find carpenters. Hospitals in West Virginia have lost out on doctors and nurses who were planning to come from overseas. A neighborhood soccer league in Memphis cannot field enough teams because immigrant children have stopped showing up.

America is closing its doors to the world, sealing the border, squeezing the legal avenues to entry and sending new arrivals and longtime residents to the exits.

Visa fees have been jacked up, refugee admissions are almost zero and international student admissions have dropped. The rollback of temporary legal statuses granted under the Biden administration has rendered hundreds of thousands more people newly vulnerable to removal at any time. The administration says it has already expelled more than 600,000 people.

Shrinking the foreign-born population won’t happen overnight. Oxford Economics estimates that net immigration is running at about 450,000 people a year under current policies. That is well below the two million to three million a year who came in under the Biden administration. The share of the country’s population that is foreign born hit 14.8 percent in 2024, a high not seen since 1890.

But White House officials have made clear they are aiming for something closer to the immigration shutdown of the 1920s, when Congress, at the crest of a decades-long surge in nativism, barred entry of people from half of the world and brought net immigration down to zero. The share of the foreign-born population bottomed out at 4.7 percent in 1970. Stephen Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, has extolled those decades of low immigration as the last time the United States was “an undisputed global superpower.”

Whether or not restrictions will restore some of what Mr. Miller views as a midcentury idyll, there’s little doubt that major changes are in store. Immigration has woven itself so tightly through the country’s fabric — in classrooms and hospital wards, city parks and concert halls, corporate boardrooms and factory floors — that walling off the country now will profoundly alter daily life for millions of Americans.

Grocery stores and churches are quieter in immigrant neighborhoods. Fewer students show up in Los Angeles and New York City. In South Florida, Billo’s Caracas Boys, a Venezuelan orchestra, puts on an annual holiday concert where generations of families come to dance salsas and paso dobles. This year, the orchestra announced at the last minute that it was canceling the show because so many people are nervous about leaving home.

The changes will also be felt hundreds of miles from any ocean or national border, even in the snow-washed streets of Marshalltown, Iowa, a city of 28,000 about an hour’s drive northeast of Des Moines.

First Mexicans, some undocumented, came to Marshalltown in the 1990s to work at the pork processing plant. After a high-profile immigration raid there in 2006, refugees with more solid legal status arrived from Myanmar, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Now, Mexican, Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants dot the blocks around the grand, 19th-century courthouse. The population is 19 percent foreign born, and some 50 dialects are spoken in the public schools. The pews at the Spanish-language Mass at the local Catholic church overflow on Sundays, and, in 2021, a Burmese religious society built a towering statue of Buddha on the outskirts of town.

“You have more energy in the community,” said Michael Ladehoff, Marshalltown’s mayor-elect. “If you stay stagnant, and you don’t have new people coming to your community, you start aging out.”

But with President Trump’s crackdown on immigration gaining strength, local festivals are more thinly attended. Parents pull their children out of school when they hear about people being detained. The supervisor overseeing the construction of a high school sports stadium received a deportation letter, creating a conspicuous absence as the work finished up. The pork plant has let workers go as their work permits have expired.

The insecurity of each immigrant ripples into the wider community. Sergii Fedko and his wife, Tetiana, came to Marshalltown in 2023 along with five other Ukrainian families under an immigration parole program for their war-torn country.

Mr. Fedko, a power plant engineer in Ukraine, was quickly hired at a local architecture firm as a designer and draftsman. Ms. Fedko works at a day care center, where she is beloved by her charges. Their three sons are enrolled in school; the eldest excel at soccer and swimming. They bought two cars and a fixer-upper house.

New immigration policies have loosened their toehold in America. They applied for an extension well before their two-year parole ended, but the White House paused processing and changed the rules. As the weeks ticked by and they didn’t hear back, they got nervous, and decided to apply for asylum as well. In mid-December, Mr. Fedko got notice that his application for the extension had been approved, but it would require a new $1,000 fee. His wife’s application is still in limbo.

If she loses her work permit, it will add to the acute shortage of child care workers that is making it harder for American parents to go to work. Mr. Fedko’s manager, Heidi Hogan, has been doing everything she can to help. Her reasons aren’t entirely selfless; there aren’t many skilled draftsmen in the area.

“If he can’t stay with us,” Ms. Hogan said, “I’m going to have a hard time finding someone else.”

An Echo of the Past

It’s not clear yet what these changes will mean for America. But a past era of immigration crackdowns contains some lessons.

Over the country’s first century, immigration was essentially unrestricted at the federal level. This began to change in the late 1800s, with the “great wave” of immigrants fleeing political oppression or seeking work. Starting in the 1870s and over the decades that followed, Congress barred criminals, anarchists, the indigent and all Chinese laborers.

By the turn of the 20th century, anti-immigrant sentiment was rampant. The lawyer and eugenicist Madison Grant wrote in his 1916 book, “The Passing of the Great Race,” that foreign countries were taking advantage of America’s openness by unloading “the sweepings of their jails and asylums” and that the “whole tone of American life, social, moral and political has been lowered and vulgarized by them.”

Grant was consulted as an expert when Congress began crafting the Immigration Act of 1924, which, along with companion legislation, barred nearly all immigration from Asia, created the U.S. Border Patrol and established quotas from eastern and southern European countries. Net immigration — which accounts for people leaving as well as those coming in — plummeted.

Today’s language echoes that time. President Trump characterizes people from Somalia, Haiti and Afghanistan as coming from “hellholes” and accuses other countries of “emptying out their prisons and their mental institutions into the United States of America.”

The broader debate in the 1920s would be familiar to contemporary ears, too: fears about crime; anxiety about the falling fertility rates of the native born; suspicion about the politics of newcomers; hopes that restrictions would mean higher wages for U.S.-born workers; disputes about assimilation.

Today, some proponents of halting immigration — including Vice President JD Vance — argue that it would help the country absorb those who were already here, decrease competition for scarce goods like housing and strengthen job opportunities for young men who had dropped out of the work force. Reihan Salam, president of the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in his 2018 book, “Melting Pot or Civil War?,” that a large and constantly growing population of low-skilled immigrants, many living in working-class ethnic enclaves, risks creating a “permanent underclass.”

Evidence is mixed on the effect of the 1920s restrictions on assimilation. Some researchers have found that, without newcomers arriving from their home countries, immigrants were more likely to marry American-born citizens and less likely to live in ethnically homogenous neighborhoods. Other studies suggest that policies aimed at forcing assimilation backfired, strengthening the determination to maintain ethnic identities.

Regardless, the effects of that period continue to reverberate. Melissa Marinaro, who directs the Italian American Program at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, said that when people who fled Italy in the years around World War II could not join family members in the United States, they went to Australia or Canada instead.

“One hundred years later, we still have Italian American families who are split from their extended families,” she said.

The restrictions passed in the 1920s governed U.S. immigration until international competition in the Cold War, the civil rights movement and a shift in organized labor’s stance led to the end of national origins quotas in 1965.

Immigrants Make Up as Much of America as Ever

Before President Trump took office, the share of the population that was born outside the U.S. matched a historic high from 1890.

% foreign born

Although the effects of the 1924 immigration restrictions are difficult to untangle from other developments — wars, technological advancements, the baby boom — wages rose for U.S.-born workers in places affected by the immigrant restrictions. But only briefly. Employers avoided paying more by hiring workers from Mexico and Canada, countries not subject to immigration caps; American-born workers from small towns migrated to urban areas and alleviated shortages. Farms turned to automation to replace the missing labor. The coal mining industry, which was powered by immigrants now barred from entry, shrank.

And today? Construction wages have been rising, even as home building has been sluggish — a potential indication that deportations in the immigrant-heavy industry are bidding up salaries. The union representing workers in the pork processing industry sees an upside, too, even though it opposes deportations and won wage increases after President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s immigration surge.

“I will certainly bring it up at the bargaining table that the way to solve a labor shortage is to pay more money,” said Mark Lauritsen, head of the meatpacking division at the United Food and Commercial Workers Union International.

The same is true in landscaping. Immigrant crews, working outside, were an easy deportation target over the summer. Come spring, said Kim Hartmann, an executive at a Chicago-area landscaping firm, the labor force could be 10 to 20 percent smaller.

“It’s going to be much more competitive to find that individual who’s been a foreman or a supervisor and has years of experience,” Ms. Hartmann said. “We know that drives costs up.”

But there are limits to how much customers will pay for decorative shrubs, and they may opt to go without. One 2022 study examined the expulsion of tens of thousands of Mexicans from the United States in the early 1930s. Contrary to the policy’s intent, unemployment rose and wages were depressed for native-born workers, possibly because sectors that depended on immigrant labor — agriculture, construction and manufacturing — suffered so much that they contracted.

The lesson of the last period of intense restriction is that employers have an array of ways to adjust, said Leah Boustan, an economics professor at Yale who studies the history of immigration.

“The menu is other sources of labor, and machinery,” she said. “It’s not obvious that you’re going to pick the guy down the street relative to these alternatives.”

Where Hands Still Matter

Today, that menu has expanded. Companies can outsource jobs to other countries. Artificial intelligence is replacing some types of work, and other countries, like Japan, have shown the possibilities of robotics. But many services still require humans, in person.

“If you’re an obstetrician, delivering a baby right in the moment, you need hands to lay on the patient,” said David Goldberg, a vice president of Vandalia Health, a network of hospitals and medical offices in West Virginia. “It’s not the same as a banker, or someone creating code.”

Nearly a fifth of nursing positions are currently vacant in West Virginia — a state that is older, sicker and poorer than most — and the state faces a serious shortage of physicians in the coming years. The answer has been to look abroad. A third of West Virginia’s physicians graduated from medical schools overseas. Now that option is narrowing.

“We lost two cardiologists because of their concern that they wouldn’t get their visa and, if they did, that they would not be able to stay here permanently,” Mr. Goldberg said. “They went elsewhere.”

Similarly, nobody has figured out how to harvest delicate crops with machines. During the low-immigration 1970s, some crops, like green onions, disappeared from shelves or were imported instead.

“It’s not going to hop from the ground into a package without somebody’s hands being involved somewhere along the way,” said Luke Brubaker, who runs a dairy farm with his sons and a grandson in Pennsylvania. To milk cows, feed them and deliver calves, he relies on more than a dozen foreign-born workers, most of them Mexican. He is not optimistic that he will be able to replace them.

“You can put an ad in the paper,” he said. “Maybe you would have one American-born applying for that job if you need 10 people. And that’s a maybe.”

For now, Mr. Brubaker can still find staff. The surge of immigrants who entered the United States under President Biden — more than eight million people — means that many foreign-born workers are still available.

That surge helped create an anti-immigrant backlash, inflaming fears about crime and jobs. It also stung immigrants who felt they had faced higher barriers than newer ones from places like Venezuela.

“The Mexican population felt that it was not fair,” said Alfonso Medina, who owns La Carreta, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Marshalltown started by his father, a Mexican immigrant, in 2000. “Imagine you’re here for 20, 30 years contributing. And all of a sudden here comes this administration and starts letting people in right away with a permit. They felt betrayed.”

In 2024, they shifted toward Mr. Trump.

Land of Opportunity?

Dan Simpson, the chief executive of Taziki’s, a fast casual Mediterranean restaurant chain based in the Southeast, has been losing employees since the beginning of the year. These were not only dishwashers and cooks but also managers and assistant managers, who had come to the United States with advanced degrees.

While he worries about the effect on his own business, he believes that the damage could be much greater.

“If you zoom back, the bigger problem is that we’re tarnishing the brand of America,” Mr. Simpson said. Even if the United States opens up again, he said, “we’re going to need a campaign to fix the idea that America is not the land of opportunity.”

International students pay full-freight tuition that helps fund new programs and basic costs at many U.S. colleges. As international enrollment has dropped, many schools are facing budget holes.

Nearly half of the immigrants who legally came to the United States from 2018 to 2022 were college educated, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Immigrants are far more likely than U.S. citizens to start businesses; nearly half of this year’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Several studies have found a decline in the number of patents issued for U.S. inventions after the immigration laws of the 1920s.

“You have an economy that is smaller, less dynamic and less diversified,” said Exequiel Hernandez, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

In early 2025, Rayan Sadri was raising money for his artificial-intelligence start-up. In June, the Trump administration barred everyone from a list of Muslim countries, including Iran, where Mr. Sadri is from. Based in Montreal and unable to travel in the United States, Mr. Sadri could no longer easily meet potential investors and customers. Moving the company to San Francisco, as he would have liked, was not going to happen. Among other factors, the ban slowed the young company’s momentum.

“Everything for start-ups is momentum,” said Mr. Sadri, who is now going to work for another tech company in Canada.

It’s not just Silicon Valley. Small enterprises across the country have been built by and for immigrants — and been embraced by a wider community. In Marshalltown, Luisa Ortega has been putting on Mexican-style rodeos and popular music acts since 2012. In recent years, white residents have started coming, too. “They like the all-day show, they want to be able to go and dance,” she said.

‘What Is the Future?’

Over the longer term, low immigration will collide with one inexorable trend: an aging population in need of care just as fewer workers are available to provide it.

Half of the people who work at Sinai Residences, a senior living facility in Boca Raton, Fla., are immigrants. Rachel Blumberg, the chief executive, has already had to notify 38 workers from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela that they will have to go because the Trump administration ended their country’s temporary legal status. That is 9 percent of her work force.

“It was like this funeral that would never end,” she said, of those conversations. “They’re my best employees.”

Rural areas and postindustrial cities have long struggled with an exodus of the young and the growing needs of the older residents who are left behind. Many of these places have pinned their futures on immigrants.

Lancaster County, Pa., most famous for a community that has refused to assimilate — the Amish — has over the years also become home to a global marketplace. People from Myanmar now fill the pews of a Mennonite church founded in the 1700s. Scores of Congolese refugees work at local distribution centers. The county seat, Lancaster, has two Nepalese restaurants. Resettling refugees, long a mission of local Mennonites, has become central to Lancaster’s growth strategy.

Unlike most Pennsylvania counties, “Lancaster’s numbers are growing,” said Heather Valudes, the president of the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. “But that is simply because of immigrants.”

Ahmed Ahmed, 31, arrived in Lancaster when he was 3. His parents, refugees from Chad, worked as certified nursing assistants, taking care of Lancaster’s elderly; Mr. Ahmed became the manager of a local hotel and a city councilman.

He now supervises some of the immigrants who came after him, including several Cuban refugees who worked at the hotel. This summer, they learned that their temporary work permits had expired. The Haitian workers at the poultry plant learned this, too. As did the Ukrainian employees at the Walmart.

They are now stuck in limbo. The economy is closed to them, but they are unable to return home — the United States does not even allow commercial flights into Haiti. Shut out of the formal work force, some will probably move to larger cities and look for under-the-table jobs, delivering food or cleaning homes.

Mr. Ahmed was not sure what became of the Cubans he worked with. He is concerned about them, and also worried about what may lie in store for his adopted hometown.

“This is only Year 1,” he said. “What is the future?”

But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to.
The evidentiary hearing is slated for Jan. 28, 2026.","The federal judge overseeing the human smuggling case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has canceled an upcoming January trial.

In lieu of that proceeding, the court will hold a one-day evidentiary hearing dedicated to ferreting out whether or not the Maryland man was vindictively and selectively prosecuted by the government.

This week, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, a Barack Obama appointee, slammed the brakes on the controversial prosecution in a relatively terse four-page order – a decided victory for the father of three and an equally stinging loss for the Trump administration.

In the ruling, the judge said the evidence provided by the defense had turned the case in Abrego Garcia's favor long ago – at least on the due process issue of whether the prosecution is vindictive.

""The burden-shifting framework controls the Court's analysis,"" Crenshaw writes. ""Specifically, once a defendant establishes a prima facie showing of vindictiveness, 'a presumption arises in defendant's favor.' The Court has already found that Abrego has made such a showing, entitling him to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on why the government is prosecuting him.""

In August, Abrego Garcia filed a motion to dismiss his federal indictment on the basis of a selective and vindictive prosecution.

In October, the court found there was a ""realistic likelihood of vindictiveness"" behind the federal charges against Abrego Garcia.

The immigration lodestar's high-profile litigation is a well-known subplot of the story of the second Trump administration. Abrego Garcia was part of a summary deportation flight to a prison notorious for torture in El Salvador, but his deportation violated multiple court orders — both specific to him and general to the flight in question.

A DOJ lawyer was sacked after admitting the Trump administration's mistakes and, through a seesawing battle that has gone up the legal ladder all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and back down to various different district courts, Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States, promptly charged with unrelated crimes, and eventually released on bail before being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yet again in late September.

Now, the outcome of the case is contingent on whether the government can rebut the presumption in the defense's favor by producing ""objective, on-the-record explanations"" for the human smuggling charges, according to the court.

The judge notes the upshot, at length:

Whether the government can produce such evidence is critical, for ""[i]f the government fails to present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption, the presumption stands and the court must find that the prosecutor acted vindictively,"" leading to ""dismissal of the charges or other appropriate remedies."" However, ""[i]f the government produces evidence to rebut the presumption, the defendant must prove that the offered justification is pretextual and that actual vindictiveness has occurred.""

Crenshaw says the next step will be the evidentiary hearing – which will ""only"" turn on whether or not the government is able to rebut the presumption currently working in Abrego Garcia's favor.

""If the government can rebut that showing, the Court will revisit the government's Motion to Quash, as the burden will again shift back to Abrego to establish that the government's rationale for prosecuting him is pretextual and that his prosecution is actually vindictive,"" the order reads.

Notably, the upcoming hearing is particularly high stakes for the Trump administration – and could upend their entire case.

""If the government fails to carry its burden at the evidentiary hearing, however, the Court need not resolve the government's Motion [to quash] on the merits, as the [defense motion to dismiss] would be granted without need for any further discovery,"" the order goes on.

Still, the court explains, the current procedural ""landscape"" of the case is something of a double-edged sword for the defense.

Again, the ruling, at length:

Because Abrego has already affirmatively satisfied the threshold question of whether he is entitled to a presumption that his prosecution is vindictive, his subpoenas of [DOJ officials] serve to support the third step of the vindictive prosecution inquiry, i.e., whether he can establish pretext and actual vindictiveness. But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to. According to Abrego, the Government has already shown that it cannot do so, given what Abrego asserts to be troves of evidence in the record indicating that his prosecution is actually vindictive. Based on this record, Abrego argues that the Court could rule on his Motion [to dismiss] without an evidentiary hearing or the testimony of [DOJ officials].

In other words, the current state of motions practice has diminished the need for discovery requested by the defense. But if the government can solicit testimony that works in its favor, the court strongly hints such discovery might very well come into play.

American justice ceases to function when its arbiters silence law enforcement and give megaphones to those who oppose our legal system.”

In the video, which was posted to TikTok on Friday, Abrego Garcia can be seen lip-syncing to “Himno de Victoria” by Danny Berrios. In a second video posted to the platform, Abrego Garcia records the sky and trees before turning the camera toward himself and singing along to Jesús Adrián Romero’s “Sumérgeme.”

Employees of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are under a gag order preventing them from making comments that could prejudice the public or interfere with Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

Earlier this month, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers accused Border Patrol officer Greg Bovino of repeated violations of the gag order, citing comments made on national television in which he referred to Abrego Garcia as an “alien smuggler” and “wife beater,” then asked the court to impose sanctions.

Under the auspices of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security, including Noem herself, have worked overtime to smear Abrego Garcia, repeatedly describing him as a “monster,” human trafficker, domestic abuser, child predator, and MS-13 gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland for years with his American wife and child, has not been convicted of any crimes, and denies any involvement in MS-13.

Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has become one of the most high-profile targets of President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation strategy.

After a judge ordered that the 30-year-old be returned to the U.S., the Trump administration immediately began working to deport him again, considering locations like Uganda and Liberia, countries to which he has no ties, and indicting him on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

Debate, enforcement activity and protesting over the issue intensified in the course of the year. Reps from both sides suggest more of the same may be in store in 2026.

Immigration agents traversed Utah to round up immigrants they say are in the country illegally, while several Utah law enforcement agencies entered into formal accords with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist. Earlier this year, Utah lawmakers approved a number of bills meant, most notably, to toughen the penalties immigrants face when they break the law. The Utah National Guard agreed to help out in a supporting role, though not in arresting immigrants.

The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Salt Lake City is the potential site of a federal processing facility for immigrant detainees, echoing a CNN report last October.

The efforts are about ""enforcing the law and doing it in a way that protects citizens here in the state, trying to get the worst offenders off the streets,"" Gov. Spencer Cox said last July. He had signaled strong support for Trump's efforts ahead of Trump's inauguration to his second presidential term last January.

Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs sounded a similar message last August in announcing plans for the city's police force to increase cooperative efforts with immigration authorities in tracking and detaining immigrants in the country illegally. ""By putting federal resources to work here in Riverton, we can better protect our residents, uphold the rule of law and keep our neighborhoods safe from criminal activity,"" he said in a statement with Riverton Police Chief Shane Taylor.

At the same time, though, the uptick in action has sparked backlash from immigrant advocates, particularly in light of enforcement action targeting immigrants without serious criminal records and others going through the process to normalize their migratory status. Foes of the crackdown spoke for four hours last July against a Utah County Sheriff's Office proposal to enter into a cooperative agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a plan that was ultimately approved. They marched through the streets of Salt Lake City last June to protest the crackdown, and demonstrated earlier this month outside the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in the Utah capital against the threat of increased enforcement action inside the facility.

Immigration attorneys — sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly — have stood up in defense of immigrants with a potentially legal basis to remain in the country and advocated for their right to due process in immigration courts. They've also expressed concern with negative characterizations of immigrants put forward by Trump and his backers.

""What concerns me most about the current government approach isn't just policy, it's the false narrative of who immigrants are,"" said Ysabel Lonazco, a West Valley City immigration attorney. ""When we portray immigrants as threats rather than recognizing them as neighbors, co-workers and contributors to our communities, we lose sight of our own story. America has always been a nation of immigrants, and that diversity has been our greatest strength, not our weakness.""

She lamented the ""dehumanization"" of immigrants under Trump, while Nicholle Pitt White, an attorney in Murray, said the president's efforts haven't been focused strictly on immigrants in the country illegally, as advertised.

""He has been aggressive to legal immigration as well, working to denaturalize — take citizenship away — from people who have followed the rules and worked hard to become Americans,"" Pitt said. ""He has paused citizenship applications and oath ceremonies for hundreds, possibly thousands, of others just to be cruel.""

Indeed, Carlos Trujillo, a South Jordan immigration attorney, said all immigrants, legal or otherwise, are feeling uneasy. Originally from Venezuela, he's a naturalized U.S. citizen who was advised last April by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to leave the country or face ""potential criminal prosecution.""

""The problem is that we all feel attacked, even the ones that are doing the right thing, even the ones that are following the law,"" Trujillo said.

As a result, many immigrants are skittish about going out in public, terrified they may be targeted by immigration agents, Pitt said.

In a statement last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lauded what she said have been the advancements under Trump, suggesting more of the same is in store for the coming year.

Though 2025 was historic, we won't rest until the job is done,"" Noem said.

""I do believe that things are going to get worse in many, many ways.""",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3116/311621/31162154.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-12-28 01:56:36.854144
