I then left for Mexico City to transmute my grief into music.
Over the course of this month, anti-gentrification protests have erupted across Mexico City.
The discourse goes much deeper than not being American enough for the Americans, or Mexican enough for the Mexicans.
I have always known that my purpose living in Mexico is to bridge my two worlds: countries, identities and cultures.","This year marks the 10th anniversary of splitting my life between the two countries I call home. My brother Jose was deported from the United States in October 2015 at age 29. He had been here since he was 2 years old. He was returned to Mexico, a country he didn’t even know.

My parents arrived in the U.S. with my two older brothers in 1989, following the rest of my mom’s family’s migration, missing their window for the Amnesty program. I was the only citizen in my family, born in Whittier and raised across Southern California. I grew up well aware of our situation, the privilege my social security number gave me, knowing that at any given moment or traffic stop, my family could be taken from me.

In 2015, I was in my last year of college, studying flashcards for my music industry midterm, when my mom called to tell me that my worst nightmare had come true.

In the 10 years since, I’ve crossed the San Ysidro Port of Entry more times than I can count, spending hours in line with a heaviness in my chest. When I’d visit my brother in Tijuana, he would ride with me until I was about to cross over. He’d hop out, we’d say our goodbyes, and I’d cry the rest of the way home. As a child, I felt the frustration of injustice for my family. But I silenced those feelings, afraid of outing their immigration status. As an adult, with their blessing, that frustration has turned into an outcry for them and the millions of families like ours.

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, 271,484 people were removed from the United States in fiscal year 2024—each deportation fracturing families like mine. Many of our parents came to the U.S. sold on the “American Dream” only to find themselves living a nightmare. They sacrificed their dreams and their careers and worked exploitative, under-the-table jobs around the clock, with no path to citizenship in sight. Now I find myself, like other first generation kids sharing similar stories online, pursuing a reverse migration toward the “Mexican Dream.”

For a long time, I fantasized about what life would be like for my family had we stayed in Mexico, or at least had the opportunity to visit over the summer and holidays like I saw my friends and their families do, their vans filled to the brim with gifts and necessities for loved ones on the other side of the border. I made a promise to myself that one day I would give myself the opportunity to at least live a chapter of my life there. Now I’m fulfilling that promise.

I knew it wouldn’t be easy to take the leap to move back to the motherland. The final push came when, in the span of two months, my grandmother passed away, I ended an abusive relationship, and Disney shelved the documentary to which I had devoted my life. Grief swallowed me whole, and all I wanted was to heal and be held by my family and the land that gave them life.

Retracing the steps of my ancestors, I began in Guadalajara with my maternal side. I met around 25 family members for the first time, but the matriarchal connection with my tías and primas was so deep, it felt like the home I always dreamed of, allowing me to truly mourn my abuela through their stories.

I then left for Mexico City to transmute my grief into music. I’ve been coming to the city since 2018. Over time I began to understand my family’s roots here, and I knew that my next music projects had to be created here–rooted in the connection to my ancestors.

Mexico is currently home to over one million Americans—the largest population of U.S. citizens living outside the United States—with an estimated 700,000 in Mexico City alone. Two and a half years later, I’m still here.

My dad’s side of the family has been in this city for nearly 100 years, coming down from Alamos, Sonora, in the 1930s for my bisabuelo’s government job. They had always been a mystery to me, as my abuelo was a pilot and died in a plane crash when my dad was a teenager. Through interviews with my two last living tía abuelas, I discovered family lore I never knew—stories of quinceañeras at Castillo de Chapultepec and possible connections to legendary Mexican cinema stars. It was a life I never knew existed as a low-income, first-generation kid of undocumented immigrants, stuck in a country that my family couldn't leave.

So what does it mean for me to be here in Mexico today as a dual citizen?

Over the course of this month, anti-gentrification protests have erupted across Mexico City. Demonstrators are expressing their rightful anger at the exploitation of the cost of living, which has been inflated by the surge of foreigners who have come here since the pandemic-induced digital nomad movement.

Meanwhile, back in California, the number of people reporting to work in the private sector decreased by 3.1% after immigration raids began—a downturn only recently matched by COVID-19 lockdowns, showing how enforcement tears apart both economies and communities. As a Mexican American, I’ve been caught in the crossfires of this ongoing discourse.

The discourse goes much deeper than not being American enough for the Americans, or Mexican enough for the Mexicans. It’s about the question: Where can we call home? A home that feels safe and dignified and where you actually belong.

As an artist and freelancer, I’ve worked contracts in pesos and dollars. My parents made the sacrifices they did for me to have that opportunity. It’s a privilege I do not take for granted. But what does that mean for people like my brother who have been deported, lived their whole lives in the states, and jobs they can get are call centers that pay in dollars? Or folks who live in Tijuana and have to pay rent in dollars? Where do we fit in this equation?

All I wanted was for folks in the U.S. who dehumanized families like mine, writing us off as “illegal”, to see our humanity. I didn’t realize I would also have to fight for our existence with our folks back in Mexico too.

The work of Chicana scholar and foremother, Gloria Anzaldua, reminds us we are not alone in existing in this liminal space — Nepantla, the Nahuatl word for “in-between.” This feels like a true reflection of my identity, and the chapter of my life from which I’m emerging. I have always known that my purpose living in Mexico is to bridge my two worlds: countries, identities and cultures.

I am grateful for everything this land has given me, and I will live here for as long as I am meant to. Wherever life takes me, if and when I have to go back to the U.S. to pursue other dreams, my goal is to create everything I can from my time here and bring it back as an offering to our people over there.

I know I will still spend the rest of my life in between both countries. And if I am to have a family to call my own one day, I’ll spend the summers I never got to have as a kid with them and my family in Mexico. I will honor my parents’ sacrifices in every way I can, and continue to pass on the love for our roots to the next generation. As our paisanos are persecuted up north, I hope to see growing solidarity and welcome among our own people south of the border as well.

What we know:

On Monday, a Chicago Tribune report suggested Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and his team would soon be reassigned. However, a DHS spokesperson on Tuesday pushed back, saying, ""We aren't leaving Chicago.""

The agency said since Operation Midway Blitz began, homicides in Chicago have dropped 16 percent, shootings are down 35 percent, robberies down 41 percent, carjackings down 48 percent, and transit crime is down 20 percent.

The denial came as Bovino prepared to visit the Little Village neighborhood on Tuesday, where community groups are planning a 9:15 a.m. demonstration at the neighborhood’s iconic arch. Gov. JB Pritzker is scheduled to appear later that morning at an American Legion event nearby.

The backstory:

Tensions between city and federal officials flared again this week after a photo circulated online showing Border Patrol agents posing in front of Chicago’s Cloud Gate sculpture, better known as ""The Bean.""

According to Block Club Chicago, some agents shouted ""Little Village"" instead of ""cheese"" while taking the picture, an apparent reference to the Southwest Side neighborhood where federal agents clashed with protesters over the weekend.

Gov. JB Pritzker sharply criticized the image, calling it ""disgusting"" and accusing federal officers of ""producing reality TV moments"" instead of keeping residents safe.

""As children are tear gassed and U.S. citizens detained, they are posing for photo ops,"" Pritzker said.

Bovino fired back on X, accusing Pritzker of lying and defending the operation as an effort to root out gangs like the Latin Kings ""that you've allowed to fester with no action for years."" He ended his post with, ""Feel free to join us in Little Village.""

‘CALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST’

Big picture view:

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump late Monday night weighed in on Truth Social, calling Chicago’s crime out of control and urging troops be called in ""BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!""

He also called the Magnificent Mile the ""Miracle Mile"" and said the ""28% vacancy factor"" along the iconic strip is due to ""murder and crime.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/bovino-pritzker-trump-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-11 12:03:25.900411

It was unclear where the team would be headed after it leaves Chicago, the sources said. Bovino said in a sworn deposition that he oversees more than 200 Border Patrol agents who were assigned to the Chicago area in early September. Since then, DHS officials have reported more than 3,000 arrests as part of the federal presence, dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The operation has involved multiple federal agencies, some of which are slated to remain in Chicago, according to sources. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has been in Chicago for decades, will not be leaving the city.

The date of Bovino’s departure, along with the reassignment of Border Patrol agents, is yet to be determined, the sources told NewsNation.

DHS officials did not confirm the departure and instead said the ongoing mission in Chicago will continue. In a post on X, Tricia McLaughlin wrote, “We aren’t leaving Chicago.”

In the post, McLaughlin wrote that since the start of Operation Midway Blitz, homicides in Chicago have dropped by 16%, shootings have decreased by 35%, robberies have declined by 41%, carjackings have dropped by 48% and transit crimes have declined 20%.

Bovino, who has remained the face of the federal presence in Chicago, told NewsNation last week that Border Patrol agents have “received a lot of thanks” from local residents and immigrants who are in the United States legally.

“They’re concerned that individuals who come to the United States (illegally) commit crimes, and I think people are beginning to realize that illegal immigration is not a victimless crime,” Bovino said.

Bovino has remained a main target of elected officials in Illinois, namely Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. On Monday, Pritzker responded to a photo of Bovino and Border Patrol agents posing in front of Chicago’s iconic Cloud Gate sculpture, where Block Club Chicago reported an agent yelled, “Everyone say, Little Village,” before a photo was taken.

In a social media post, Pritzker said, “Making fun of our neighborhoods and communities is disgusting.” A spokesperson for Pritzker’s office did not respond to a request for comment from NewsNation on Monday after Bovino invited Pritzker to join him in the city’s Little Village neighborhood Tuesday.

Little Village has remained a flashpoint of clashes between federal agents and residents throughout the federal operation. Bovino was captured on video throwing a canister of tear gas into a crowd of protesters, which drew the ire of U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, who had previously issued a temporary restraining order, limiting the use of force by federal agents.

Last week, Ellis extended the order with an extensive injunction and ruled Bovino had lied under oath about being hit in the head with a rock before throwing the tear gas. On Monday, attorneys for the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to have a stay issued in response to Ellis’ order.

“Greg Bovino and his masked agents are not here to make Chicago safer,” the governor wrote. “… They are posing for photo ops and producing reality TV moments.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/68e3fdf2a353c0.42947885.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-11 11:02:54.555129

“CALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE! ‘Just the News.’”

But, according to The Chicago Tribune, federal immigration agents under Commander Gregory Bovino may soon leave the Illinois metropolis as the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” winds down after two months of contentious raids on alleged undocumented migrants.

Bovino is expected to leave within days to take up another assignment elsewhere, the Tribune reported on Monday. At the same time, his Border Patrol forces are redeployed and an on-call task force, composed of FBI personnel and U.S. attorneys, parts ways.

“Every day DHS enforces the laws of this country, including in Chicago,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement. “We do not comment or telegraph future operations.”

The administration claims to have made more than 3,000 arrests since beginning its operations in the area in early September, but its actions have provoked tensions at the street level.

Confrontations with protesters have seen a person shot in an incident in which two cars were accused of ramming an agency van, a Presbyterian minister hit in the head with pepper balls, and tear gas fired in residential streets, creating a climate of fear among residents.

Bovino was ordered to testify in federal court in late October after he and his masked officers faced a wave of allegations about their aggressive tactics, including one episode in which an agent was accused of pointing a gun at a demonstrator and saying “bang, bang” and “you’re dead, liberal.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has repeatedly made the case that federal intervention in local law enforcement is unnecessary, decrying the crackdown by comparing it to events in Nazi Germany and urging ICE to stand down over the Halloween holiday weekend to ensure the safety of trick-or-treaters.

Pritzker took the agency to task again on Monday after its officers posed for a team photograph in front of the Cloud Gate sculpture, known as the Bean, in Millennium Park.

“Making fun of our neighborhoods and communities is disgusting,” the governor said.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested Hamdi, a media commentator and outspoken critic of Israel, last month while he was on a speaking tour in the US.

The State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alleged at the time that Hamdi supports terrorism and poses a threat to national security, while his lawyers have argued he was targeted for criticising Israel and its war in Gaza.

Hamdi will be released from ICE detention in the next few days and return to the UK, his representatives say.

Hamdi was visiting the US to speak at events for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim advocacy group, when ICE officers arrested him at the San Francisco International Airport on 26 October.

His detainment came after the US government revoked Hamdi's visa and criticism from far-right political activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who accused him of supporting terrorists.

""We've said it before, we'll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans"", the State Department said of Hamdi at the time he was detained.

The BBC has reached out to the US State Department, ICE, and DHS for comment and confirmation of the agreement to release Hamdi.

Lawyers for Hamdi and the California chapter of CAIR said in a Monday statement that they welcome an agreement allowing Hamdi to voluntarily return to the UK instead of facing deportation.

They said he was targeted for speaking against ""Israel's war crimes against Palestinians"".

CAIR said that the immigration charging document filed in Hamdi's case only accuses him of overstaying his visa, which the government revoked without notifying him first.

The organisation said the charging document does not identify ""any criminal conduct or security grounds"", which it said was proof that Hamdi was never a danger to the community or to national security.

""It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell. His only real 'offense' was speaking clearly about Israel's genocidal war crimes against Palestinians,"" Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of California's CAIR chapter, said in the news release.

When reached for comment, the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not confirm details of Hamdi's detainment or release but told the BBC that it was providing consular assistance to a ""British man detained in the USA"". The office said it has also been in touch with the man's family and with local US authorities.

""This decision brings joy to me, his mother, his wife, our entire family, and all of Sami's supporters around the world,"" Hamdi's father, Dr Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi, wrote on X.

Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee",Not Available,,,,,https://www.rcfp.org/litigation/mlk50-v-juvenile-court-memphis/,"Case Number: CH-25-1700 Court: Shelby County Chancery Court Clients: MLK50: Justice through Journalism, Memphis Fourth Estate, Memphis Publishing, and Nexstar Media Group.
The rules also require that the court consider reasonable alternatives to closure and make written findings to support the closure.
The lawsuit — filed against the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, and its Judge Sugarmon, in his official capacity — argues that the press and the public have a rule-based presumptive right of access to juvenile delinquency proceedings.
Quote: “In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said.
“In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings.","Case Number: CH-25-1700

Court: Shelby County Chancery Court

Clients: MLK50: Justice through Journalism, Memphis Fourth Estate, Memphis Publishing, and Nexstar Media Group.

Background: In Tennessee, rules that govern access to the state’s juvenile courts state that proceedings involving children accused of committing crimes or other offenses are presumptively “open to the public.” The rules and case law make clear that these proceedings can only be closed after a court has balanced the interests of the parties and the public’s “compelling interest” in open proceedings and ensured that closure is no broader than necessary. The rules also require that the court consider reasonable alternatives to closure and make written findings to support the closure.

But the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, has adopted and enforced a policy that makes juvenile delinquency proceedings presumptively closed by requiring members of the public to request and obtain permission from the court up to 48 hours in advance to attend any of these proceedings. The policy requires requesters to specifically name the juvenile whose hearing they want to attend.

In February 2025, Paul McAdoo, the Reporters Committee’s Local Legal Initiative attorney for Tennessee, sent a letter on behalf of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism urging Judge Tarik B. Sugarmon to reconsider the policy, arguing that it violated the juvenile court rules and was impeding news coverage of proceedings. Judge Sugarmon and another court official responded that they would maintain the policy and have continued to do so even after McAdoo sent a letter in March that again urged them to stop enforcing it.

In November 2025, McAdoo filed this lawsuit on behalf of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, Memphis Fourth Estate, Memphis Publishing, and Nexstar Media Group.

The lawsuit — filed against the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee, and its Judge Sugarmon, in his official capacity — argues that the press and the public have a rule-based presumptive right of access to juvenile delinquency proceedings. It asks the court to declare that the advance permission policy is illegal and block its enforcement.

Quote: “In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said. “In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings. This unlawful policy deprives the public of timely, accurate information about how the court is handling the cases that come before it, particularly at a time when Shelby County is incarcerating more children than in recent years.”

Related: In June 2025, McAdoo successfully represented WBIR in a fight for public access to a 15-year-old’s murder prosecution in Meigs County Juvenile Court. WBIR used the unsealed records and a video of the previously closed proceeding to shed new light on the case.

Menocal suggested that this is shaping up to be a rough term for government contractors.

The dominant position of the justices was that whatever protection the contractor might have, it is simply a defense, not the kind of immunity from suit that would justify an immediate appeal.

Menocal suggested that this is shaping up to be a rough term for government contractors. As I wrote last week, the argument in Hencely v. Fluor Corporation did not appear to go well for the contractor, and the justices seemed even more clearcut in their lack of sympathy for the contractor’s position in GEO.

The GEO case involves claims by ICE detainees against a contractor operating an ICE detention facility, and the question for the justices is whether the contractor gets an immediate appeal when a district court rejects the contractor’s argument that the detainees have no claims against the contractor if the contractor is simply following ICE’s instructions.

The dominant position of the justices was that whatever protection the contractor might have, it is simply a defense, not the kind of immunity from suit that would justify an immediate appeal. Indeed, the opening question of the argument set a tone that did not change much as the hour wound down: Justice Clarence Thomas politely asked Dominic Draye, counsel for the contractor (GEO), if he could point to “the language in [the relevant Supreme Court precedent] that indicates … this immunity from suit.” When Draye admitted that the pertinent precedent, Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction, doesn’t have any such language, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson interjected to ask why “isn’t Yearsley better understood as a defense than an immunity?”

Justice Elena Kagan took the tack of parsing Yearsley more closely, and in particular the factors it suggests for determining when the contractor should be able to shift responsibility to the government and thus claim immunity. In particular, she wanted to know whether the contractor is claiming that “‘I satisfied the Yearsleycriteria and that shows that I did nothing wrong?’ Or [that] ‘I satisfied the Yearsley criteria, and that means that even though I did something wrong, I am, in fact, protected from legal consequences?’” When Draye said his client was arguing that it should be protected even if it did something wrong, Kagan commented that “the rationale of Yearsley” is that “I’m following the government’s instructions and the government’s instructions are lawful, so, obviously, everything I did was lawful too.” At which point Jackson chimed in to emphasize that Draye’s client “wouldn’t get the Yearsley defense [if the instructions were unlawful], because … the government would have to have the authority to issue the instructions, and to the extent the instructions violated the law, they wouldn’t be authorized.”

Justice Brett Kavanaugh also was skeptical, asking “[w]hy is the government on the other side from you []? I mean, that seems like a big … hurdle.” For Kavanaugh, it didn’t ring true for Draye to argue that a vote against the contractor “will thwart the implementation … of all [those] government programs? I’m just not seeing that. And because [the federal government is] on the other side, it casts doubt on your assertion that all these programs are going to be [adversely affected if we rule against you].”

It would be an exaggeration, at least a slight one, to say that the argument was unremittingly hostile to the contractor, as there was a substantial passage in its favor during the argument of Jennifer Bennett (representing the detainees). At that point, Justice Samuel Alito pressed insistently the argument that if Bennett’s clients had sued “ICE and specific ICE officials,” they “could raise sovereign immunity; they could raise qualified immunity … And if the district court denied any of those, then they could get an interlocutory appeal. So why shouldn’t the rule be the same for GEO?”

For Alito, it seemed self-evident that the same protections should be available to the contractor as were available to ICE and its own employees. But if other justices share that view, they certainly kept it to themselves. It wouldn’t surprise me if Alito took the time to write in support of the GEO here, but it would surprise me if a strong majority doesn’t reject the contractor’s claim.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2176485456.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 11:03:11.055580

Navigation application audio clip

In a half mile, take the Pennsylvania 378 south exit toward Bethlehem.

Sonja Hutson

I am walking down Main Street in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and it almost kind of feels like a movie set of an American small town. You know, tree-lined streets, black lamp posts, brick sidewalks, cute little restaurants and shops and coffee shops, and not far from where I’m standing in downtown is the rusting remains of the former steelworks. Bethlehem is a former steel town, and it kind of feels like the ghost of Bethlehem’s past a little bit, very symbolically looming over the town.

Female voice clip 1

It’s also just a symbol of pride and like a symbol of, you know, those working-class roots.

Male voice clip 1

Bethlehem is a wonderful place because there’s so many different people and walks of life.

Female voice clip 2

It’s a, you know, a historic town. But I think it’s pushing towards the future.

Sonja Hutson

The town has successfully transitioned to other industries like tech, logistics, education and healthcare. We actually passed a major hospital on the way into town, but there’s still a lot of economic angst here and political division.

Male voice clip 2

I like what the Republicans are doing compared to the Democrats. I don’t want to pay healthcare for illegals.

Female voice clip 3

I don’t think politicians should be dictating what women should do with their bodies.

Female voice clip 4

I really like the ideas of libertarianism, so basically do whatever you want, marry who you want.

Sonja Hutson

Not only is Bethlehem a case study of how politics has changed in post-industrial America, it’s also a critical area in a critical swing state. Over the next several years, the Financial Times is going to be taking a close look at Bethlehem to try to understand how big political and economic issues are playing out in people’s day-to-day lives. And we’re gonna bring you an audio version of some of those stories right here on the Swamp Notes podcast. I’m Sonja Hutson and this is the first episode of our special series on Bethlehem.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

I’m joined by the FT’s US news editor Derek Brower, who has been spearheading the newsroom’s Bethlehem Project. He’s here to talk more about what we can expect from it. Hi Derek.

Derek Brower

Hi Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

So tell us a little bit about this project and what you’re hoping readers and listeners will get out of it.

Derek Brower

Well, that’s a good question, Sonja. We thought, I think looking at how we covered the previous election, how American politics is covered in general, that we needed to do something from the ground up and explain how people living in Trump’s America were feeling about Trump’s America. There’s trillions of dollars at stake in how elections are decided. Bond markets are affected by who wins an election. Housing prices are affected, the global economy is affected, and those elections are decided by people in battleground states and swing states in corners of states like Pennsylvania, like Bethlehem. So that’s why we want to go find out how these people are feeling.

Sonja Hutson

And why did you pick Bethlehem in particular?

Derek Brower

We wanted to find a city in America that represented a lot of the themes that are prevalent in the Maga movement. And so Bethlehem, which by the way will be famous to some of our listeners as this place that was the home of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which steel-guarded the Golden Gate Bridge and Empire State Building and so on. The industrial past is such a big and important theme of the politics that Donald Trump has espoused in recent years. So that’s the first thing.

It also has shifted politically in ways that the country has shifted politically over the past elections. The movements in how people have voted have been towards the winning candidate. The demography is akin to that across the country with Latinos and an African-American population living alongside majority white population. And then fundamentally, it’s just a city that I think will allow us to explore some of the big themes of Donald Trump’s economy. That’s the crackdown on immigration, the impact of tariffs, his efforts to control inflation and the hopes and aspirations, but also the anxieties of younger people as they try to fathom or figure out how they’re going to get new jobs, live with an AI revolution that they see unfolding in front of them and afford housing.

Sonja Hutson

And the main story in our first episode today is about the crackdown on immigration that you mentioned. We’ll get to that in just a second. Derek Brower, the FT’s US news editor. Thanks so much for your time.

Derek Brower

Thanks, Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration, a central part of his second term. Cities across the country are experiencing more raids from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, as a result.

News clip 1

We’re following a massive ICE raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.

News clip 2

Protests erupted in the streets of Los Angeles after immigration officials conducted several raids and arrested dozens of people.

Sonja Hutson

Bethlehem is no exception. Back in June, an immigration raid at a construction site sent a chill through the city.

News clip 3

Tonight, the Bethlehem community came out to stand in solidarity with 17 people arrested by ICE during a raid.

Sonja Hutson

Now, this was relatively small compared to some of the other immigration enforcement actions across the country this year. But the response in Bethlehem, which is 30 per cent Hispanic, highlighted the intense division over how to treat people who work and contribute to society, but also came to the country illegally.

The FT’s Guy Chazan went to Bethlehem to learn more about this. He joins me now to talk about it. Hi, Guy.

Guy Chazan

Hi.

Sonja Hutson

So let’s rewind a little to June. Tell me what we know about the raid and any other immigration enforcement actions since then.

Guy Chazan

Well, the men who were detained were construction workers, and they were restoring a place called Five 10 Flats, which was an apartment complex in the south side of Bethlehem that had been damaged in a fire. And they’re all led away. Some people were on the scene and actually photographed it and filmed it on their phones.

[AUDIO CLIP OF RAID PLAYING]

Guy Chazan

But no one in Bethlehem seems to know where the men who were mainly from Venezuela and Mexico are being held, or even whether they’re still in the United States. There’ve been further detentions since then. For example, one woman I spoke to watched in horror as ICE agents led her husband away. Her husband’s called Darwin Contreras. He was attending a routine appointment at Lehigh County Courthouse, which is just in the neighbouring town of Allentown, and he’s been in detention ever since.

Sonja Hutson

And can you just back up a little bit and talk about how this raid fits in with immigration enforcement that we’ve seen across the country this year?

Guy Chazan

Well, ICE — Immigration Customs Enforcement — has really stepped up its activities all over the country. We saw in Los Angeles, for example, how ICE agents raided car parks next to Home Depot stores where Mexican day labourers often gathered to pick up work. And this is really coming from the top of the White House officials like Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff, have been saying how. It was important for us to really step up its enforcement activities and really pursue undocumented aliens and detain them and possibly deport them. So we’re seeing this across the country. Really, what happened in Bethlehem is no exception at all.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah. And like we heard earlier, there was a rally after the raid in support of the people who were arrested. You spoke to someone who helped organise that. Can you tell me about them and how they reacted to the raid when it happened?

Guy Chazan

Well, yes. This is Jon Irons, who’s a local county commissioner.

Jon Irons

I was born in Ecuador and I was adopted as an infant. And so I grew up outside of Chicago. And so, you know, the immigrant story is part of my story too.

Guy Chazan

And I went with him to the construction site where the raid happened.

Jon Irons

We’re aware that ICE has been operating for a long time and detaining people. But we haven’t seen these large work site raids in Bethlehem.

Guy Chazan

He told me that the raid had made him really scared.

Jon Irons

You know, I know that my citizenship and my status is just a legal decision and that it can be taken away from me. And we need to acknowledge that everyone’s at risk.

Guy Chazan

He felt like if they were targeting these men, then really everyone was at risk. Everyone with an immigrant background was at risk of being arrested and possibly deported. And after the raid happened Jon Irons helped organise this protest that about 500 people showed up to.

[AUDIO CLIP OF PROTEST]

Guy Chazan

They were holding up placards that said things like, don’t bite the hands that feed you. And we speak for those you silenced. Jon Irons described the mood of this protest, but he also said how people generally feel in the city.

Jon Irons

Yeah. There was a lot of anger, there was a lot of, you know, fear and this was kind of the moment we’re talking about this change in our federal government and what’s happening with the expansion of the ICE budget and sort of rise of fascism. And so people were ready to be activated on this.

Guy Chazan

And it’s obvious that people are very exercised by these ICE enforcement actions. And really, it’s led to waves of protests, not only in big cities like Los Angeles, but also in small communities like Bethlehem.

Sonja Hutson

Well, what do immigration officials have to say about the raid and some of the other arrests that they’ve made in Bethlehem since then?

Guy Chazan

Well, Homeland Security basically said that these inspections, as they call them, workplace inspections, are critical for targeting illegal employment practices. And they’re saying that such practices actually undermine American workers and destabilise labour markets. And one spokesman for the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, has also sort of hit back at the criticism of the arrest of Darwin Contreras, saying that he was actually a criminal with convictions and that he was arrested during a court hearing for driving under the influence.

Sonja Hutson

Well, Guy, what about people in the community that were in support of the raid? What did they tell you?

Guy Chazan

They basically said that the people who were arrested in that June raid had broken the law and, you know, what country is going to just turn and look the other way when people enter the country illegally? There was also a sense of trying to create a kind of deterrent effect as well. I think we are not gonna just sort of turn a blind eye to this illegal immigration to these undocumented aliens. They are going to be held accountable for breaking the law. So that was the argument that the supporters of this policy were pushing that I spoke to in Bethlehem.

Sonja Hutson

I feel like this conversation that we’ve been having around the responses to the raid has been very black and white. Did you talk to anyone in Bethlehem whose opinion falls more in the middle?

Guy Chazan

Yes. I mean, for example, the head of the local chamber of commerce, Tony Ianelli, he was very, very nuanced on it. He said he was OK with some measures to crack down on immigration.

Tony Ianelli

Do I think that, quote unquote, very bad people who have committed very bad crimes, do I think removing them from illegally being here, you know, I think that’s OK.

Guy Chazan

But Ianelli also said that there really should be a pathway for people who have been in the country for a long time and haven’t committed any crimes, a pathway for them to achieve citizenship.

Tony Ianelli

There are a lot of good, hardworking people that are, number one, would contribute, but number two, are doing lots of jobs that many people are not lining up to do, and I mean, hardworking jobs with a dedication like I’ve never seen.

Guy Chazan

And that that would actually solve a lot of problems and also be good for the economy.

Sonja Hutson

So we’ve heard takes from across the spectrum throughout this conversation, but do we have any data on how many people fall into these different camps?

Guy Chazan

Well, I think polls show how divided the country is on this. A New York Times Sienna poll in September found that 51 per cent of people thought Trump’s actions on immigration had gone too far. But 47 per cent said they had been just right or not gone far enough. So there is sort of rising concern about the way this policy is being implemented, but there are still plenty of people who agree with it.

Sonja Hutson

Yeah, it’s interesting because in some ways like the imagery, or at least the imagery that the Republican party has put out about the border of all of these people coming across, if you’re living in Pennsylvania, that’s almost 2,000 miles away from you, but it probably feels really different when that immigration enforcement actually comes to your community.

Guy Chazan

Absolutely. And you know, Bethlehem is 30 per cent Hispanic. And from my conversations with people, it became clear that really a lot of the Hispanic people who live in Bethlehem have been there for decades and are really very, very well entrenched in the community and respected members of their community. I kept hearing the word hardworking, skilled workers.

Sonja Hutson

Something that I feel like we keep coming back to is this idea of contributing economically and whether these immigrants have contributed economically, been hardworking as you mentioned. How big of an impact on the economy has Trump’s deportation drive had?

Guy Chazan

I think it’s increasingly important and you know, over the summer we saw a lot of agricultural workers being arrested and people in the hospitality industry, these are sectors of the economy that have long experienced labour shortages. And you heard farmers, you heard people who own restaurants complaining about the fact that the policies of the Trump administration were actually undermining their business because they were not going to be able to replace the foreign workers that were now being rounded up and in some cases deported.

And there was a really interesting paper put out earlier this year by researchers from the centrist Brookings Institution and the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, and it predicts that a drop in net migration will put significant downward pressure on growth in the labour force and employment, and quote, monthly payroll employment growth could be near zero or negative in the next few years. And in fact, the last non-farm payroll report we got shows there has been very little change in employment since April. So there is a kind of economic argument in all of this as well, and that is something that is potentially quite dangerous for the Republican party, and for the Trump White House. If they pursue these policies too aggressively, they could lead to strains on the economy, which will put off traditional Republican constituencies.

Sonja Hutson

What does all this tell you about the approach that each political party has taken on immigration and maybe also what approach they should take to appeal to voters in a critical area like Bethlehem?

Guy Chazan

Well, I think the overall impression I had from this was that Bethlehem is a swing city. Pennsylvania is a swing state. I think it’s one of those things where swing voters or independents are really put off by what the Trump administration is doing in terms of immigration. They might have wanted the new government to exert greater control over the southern border, but I don’t think they envisage these kind of policies, the sort of snatching people in workplaces and at courthouses and so on. And I think among sort of real classic swing voters, there is a sort of revulsion from that. I don’t know yet whether it’s enough to make them change their minds about the Republican party and sort of swing them more towards the Democrats. I think it’s still a bit early to tell, but it’s generally, it could be one of those issues that does emerge as a sort of important factor in the midterm elections next year if the Democrats really harness that in order to win support and win over those wavering voters.

Sonja Hutson

Guy, you mentioned earlier that a lot of people in the community were shocked by this raid. You know, now that it happened and there’s been some time for people to sit with this, where do you think Bethlehem goes from here?

Guy Chazan

Well, it’s interesting. There was a very, very robust response in a group of residents created something called the Lehigh Valley Emergency Response Network.

John Stratton

We don’t set out thinking that we’re going to necessarily prevent every ICE arrest in the Lehigh Valley. I mean, I think that would be unrealistic.

Guy Chazan

And the idea is that they want to, as the local pastor John Stratton put it to me, they want to be able to sort of monitor ICE actions because ICE is acting in places which it never did before, such as courthouses.

John Stratton

We are documenting any human rights violations that we are bearing witness to the violence of ICE and the cruelty of ICE.

Guy Chazan

And also provide resources to people who are seeing loved ones and relatives and friends get arrested and deported, providing advice to them, maybe some legal support as well.

And I very much look forward to holding my annual Lincoln County town hall in the weeks ahead to hear directly from coastal families and small businesses what they’d think about any such unwelcome and unneeded makeover of Newport.”

State Rep. David Gomberg released a statement in his newsletter Nov. 10.

""The Oregon Coast, with reliance on hospitality, fishing and food processing, and agriculture, has largely been able to avoid the consequences and controversy of immigration actions that have challenged our larger cities.

We are now aware there are persistent rumors and reports that ICE is in the process of expanding operations near the Newport Municipal Airport in space that has been deeded to the Coast Guard. Predictably, the federal agencies that actually know something are not saying. But I have been in constant contact with our US Senators and Congresswoman, the Governor’s office, Attorney General, and local leaders.

What I do know is that reports indicate the proposed siting of a new ICE detention facility in the Newport area. We are aware that our local Coast Guard helicopter has been relocated to North Bend, and that is disturbing.

I’m not aware of any planned public reaction. As always, I encourage people to exercise their first amendment rights peacefully, lawfully, and constructively. Know your rights.

I should also add that our US Coast Guard is not ICE. They are currently on duty, as always, protecting our communities, coastline, visitors and particularly our fishing fleet. That includes occasionally posting vans (sometimes unmarked) with government plates at lookout stations to observe traffic in our harbors. I’ve received reports of some personnel being harassed. That needs to stop! The Coast Guard saves lives and we support their brave work and presence here.

I will update you as this situation evolves.

Oregon remains a sanctuary state. And within that status, anyone committing crimes against people or property should be held accountable regardless of immigration status.

The federal government needs to fix their broken immigration laws and border policies. But that should not include tearing local families apart, intimidating and debilitating local businesses and their employees, or upending local communities.

Reasonable people will have different reactions to how our federal government best handles immigration policy.

The officer indicated that the man then exited one of the vehicles and pointed a gun toward the woman behind the wheel of the other.

The Fullerton PD officer said he didn't know who the man was or the circumstances surrounding the situation, so he stopped to assist. When he intervened, the man told him that he was an ICE agent and presented credentials proving his identity.

The agent told the officer that the woman was following and filming him, according to Fullerton PD. In a later statement, the Department of Homeland Security claimed the woman tried to ""cause a collision.""

""To defend himself, following the aggression of the driver and her refusal to follow law enforcement commands, our officer followed his training and drew his weapon,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Fullerton PD said the officer ""informed the agent that he could not assist with someone following or recording him if no crime had occurred.""

The woman then left the scene, and the officer reiterated to the ICE agent that he couldn't do anything if she hadn't committed a crime. McLaughlin disputed the officer's account, claiming he ""declined to help our law enforcement, stating it was an immigration matter.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/20/e5bbc329-2959-421a-ac8a-be9b284721bf/thumbnail/1200x630/3d38198dfe58cd2c4e369aef14c71bbc/blue-police-lights.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 03:57:14.703627

""These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.""
Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied.","This article was first published by the nonprofit newsroom LAist on November 6, 2025 and is republished here with permission.

For three immigration judges, the day took a similar turn.

Kyra Lilien, who was hired in 2023, was presiding in a courtroom in Concord, Calif., in July when she paused the hearing of an immigrant seeking asylum to read an email.

""I told them that we were not going to have a hearing because I had just been fired,"" Lilien said. Present in the court was a court interpreter and an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security. ""They asked me if I was joking.""

Anam Petit, who was hired as an immigration judge in 2023 after a career in immigrant defense, was sitting on the bench in her courtroom in Virginia's Annandale Immigration Court in September. It was her two-year anniversary in the position and she was between hearings when she got the email.

""My voice was shaking. My hands were shaking. My mind was racing. And I gave the decision and I dismissed everyone without mentioning anything,"" Petit said. One decision that day was to deny asylum, and the other was a partial denial, each for a different member of one immigrant family, she recalled.

Tania Nemer was hired as a judge at the Cleveland immigration court in 2023. She had about 30 or 40 immigrants, a DHS attorney and staff in her court one morning in February. She had just finished explaining rights and responsibilities to the group when her door opened and her manager asked her to come with him. She was later escorted out of the building.

""I didn't know at all why I was being fired at the time. And I kept asking; no one had a reason,"" Nemer said.

Nemer was one of the first immigration judges fired by the Trump administration after a slew of dismissals of leaders at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the branch of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. Later that month, the administration fired 12 judges — an entire incoming class that had just been trained and was about to take the bench.

Those dismissals come as the administration has ramped up mass deportations of those without legal status, and sometimes pointed to judges as obstacles in that effort.

The pattern has been consistent. Every few months this year, a new class of judges gets termination notices in the middle of the day, often while they are in the middle of immigration court proceedings. The notices often target those who have reached the end of their two-year probationary period, a trial period for federal workers before they are ""converted"" to permanent employees. It was previously common for these civil servants to be converted to permanent employees of the DOJ.

""None of us have been given an explanation, we are in the dark, but we've been trying to ascertain patterns,"" Lilien said, the former judge in northern California. She wonders if her past experience representing immigrants got her fired, even though she also worked at DHS as an asylum officer.

Her hunch has some correlation with the data. NPR has independently identified 70 immigration judges who received termination notices from the Trump administration between February and October. The number of judges who received termination letters matches the tally kept by the immigration judges' union. It also accords with NPR's past coverage of the terminations.

The count does not include assistant chief immigration judges (ACIJ), who are courthouse supervisors and also have their own dockets. The union has counted 11 ACIJs terminated.

An analysis of each of the 70 immigration judges' professional backgrounds found that judges with backgrounds defending immigrants, and no prior work history at DHS, made up about 44% of the firings — more than double the share of those who had only prior work history at DHS.

NPR also analyzed the classes of judges onboarded between February 2023 and November 2024, who would have neared the ends of their probationary periods this year or are still in the probationary period. Of those judges, those who had prior DHS experience, including working as asylum officers and as attorneys for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, made up the largest share still on the bench.

NPR reached out to the DOJ, EOIR and the White House for a comment on the firings and NPR's findings. The press staff at EOIR is furloughed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, according to automatic email replies, though immigration courts are still operational. The White House referred questions to the DOJ.

""DOJ doesn't 'target' or 'prioritize' immigration judges for any personnel decision one way or the other based on prior experience,"" a DOJ spokesperson told NPR in a statement. ""DOJ continually evaluates all immigration judges, regardless of background, on factors such as conduct, impartiality/bias, adherence to the law, productivity/performance, and professionalism.""

The spokesperson added that, ""pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, IJs (Immigration Judges) are inferior officers who are appointed and removed by the Attorney General.""

The spokesperson disputed the 70 count, saying the agency has terminated fewer than 55 judges, but was unable to provide more details. The agency's number is inconsistent with other news reports, NPR's prior reporting and the union. NPR reached out to reconcile the numbers. The DOJ spokesperson said staff have been furloughed and the Justice Department is not able to confirm their data.

Employees search for reasons

Fired judges have been grasping at straws to understand why they were fired — some have filed Freedom of Information Act requests. Others have turned to wrongful termination complaints and lawsuits. Some worry they were targeted on the basis of protected classes, such as gender or race.

""I fit the bill,"" said Nemer, who had represented immigrants prior to becoming an immigration judge. Nemer listed off characteristics cited in a lawsuit she has filed, arguing she was fired based on various protected classes.

""It's hard to know without having the explanations of why judges were fired,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on immigration policy. ""But the way the Trump administration is approaching immigration courts reflects a really high prioritization of immigration enforcement and [the administration] has really made deportations this whole-of-government effort.""

Immigration judges approve or deny a final order of deportation. Court officials have placed pressure on judges to move through their dockets faster, including by reviewing asylum cases without hearings.

Each fired judge can leave behind thousands of cases, according to several interviews with fired judges throughout the year. Each case is an immigrant who has likely already waited years for their day in court, to make the case for why they should be allowed to stay in the U.S.

Many of these cases have now been reassigned to other judges, at the bottom of their already years-long dockets. Immigrants whose cases were already in progress, or set to be reviewed soon, now have new dates as far out as 2029.

There were 700 immigration judges at the start of the year. Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress approved a spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including the hiring of more immigration judges, to address the backlog of millions of cases at immigration court.

Fear of retribution

Probationary judges aren't the only ones who have been fired under the Trump administration. NPR tracked 12 fired judges who started prior to 2023. This means they were fired after their two-year probationary period.

Some have been left wondering if their firings were retribution for the decisions they made on the bench.

Shira Levine had worked for EOIR since 2021 before being fired in September. She was presiding over a hearing for an immigrant who had already waited more than five years for a day in court when she got the email.

""People looked surprised, but no one looked shocked,"" Levine said. ""That's because, unfortunately, this by that point had become a pattern."" She said she didn't expect to be removed since she had passed her two-year mark. She was never given a reason.

Levine, like several others, received a standard email that they were being terminated pursuant to Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to dismiss federal employees.

Levine thought she might have been dismissed because of her response to some recent Trump administration policies.

During the summer months, immigration judges had already had to contend with an outsized enforcement presence in normally empty courtroom hallways. ICE attorneys — who argue on behalf of a government that an immigrant should be deported — started more regularly filing ""motions to dismiss"" cases. When a judge granted such a motion, migrants would be detained before leaving the building.

Levine said such motions should be granted if there is a change in the individual migrant's case, not a change in immigration policy.

""I was not told it was because of my decision to deny the motion to dismiss that I was fired,"" Levine said. ""But I handed down a decision that contravened what they apparently wanted the judges to do.""

Others, like Ila Deiss or Emmett Soper, who had been immigration judges since 2017 and 2016, served as career officials at the DOJ for nearly two decades.

Soper had been with EOIR since graduating law school in a variety of other roles. He doesn't know if his firing had anything to do with past policy work under the Biden administration's EOIR director or his handling of cases as a judge.

As the Trump administration brings in new people to the bench, he has concerns over the loss of experienced judges.

""You have to be able to manage your courtroom and you have to make very difficult, sometimes life-or-death decisions, with the person whose life is going to be affected and the family members sometimes right in front of you,"" Soper said.

""It's not something that you pick up right away. And with all of these judges — many of whom are very experienced — being fired, the agency is losing something that will take a long time to get back, if they ever can.""

Prior political interference

The agency is prioritizing other judges to hire.

The Trump administration has moved to bring back immigration judges it sees as unfairly fired by the Biden administration. The Justice Department, ina February memo, said that it cannot be confident the Biden administration was ethical and lawful in how it dismissed immigration judges and other adjudicators.

A handful of judges in 2022 had not been converted to permanent employment, sparking GOP outrage over what lawmakers saw as political interference.

Earlier this year, Matthew O'Brien and David White, two of those judges let go under President Joe Biden, were reinstated at immigration courts in Virginia. O'Brien was brought back to a managerial position, as NPR previously reported — though he is no longer with EOIR. White is a judge at the Falls Church court.

The Justice Department appointed a new director of EOIR, Daren Margolin, in October. Margolin has previous experience as the assistant chief immigration judge, or courthouse supervisor, throughout multiple courts in California, and a background as a military and DHS lawyer. He had been fired from a command position at a Marine base for negligently firing a gun and had left EOIR in 2024 before returning to lead the agency.

Then the DOJ last month announced its first class of 2025, which included 25 temporary judges who are military lawyers.

""EOIR is restoring its integrity as a preeminent administrative adjudicatory agency,"" the announcement states. ""These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.""

The incoming class of permanent judges comprises mostly those with a background in federal government work, including EOIR itself and the Department of Homeland Security. Their previous jobs included training Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, serving as asylum officers and working for ICE's legal arm.

One judge was originally going to take the bench at the start of the year, but was among theinitial class of judges fired before they could start. None of the incoming judges appear to have previously worked in the field of immigrant defense based on EOIR's announcement.

Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time

In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied. Many came to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others became judges after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or in private practice. Some have no immigration law experience, which was previously a requirement for temporary judges but not for permanent ones.

When immigration courts were first established, it was more common for immigration judges to have an enforcement background, said Dana Leigh Marks, a former immigration judge and immigration attorney who litigated landmark immigration cases before the Supreme Court.

Marks joined the court in 1987, when courts were still under the former Immigration and Naturalization Service branch of the DOJ.

""Frankly, I was one of the individuals who was hired to show that it wasn't just a career path of prosecution that led you to be eligible to be an immigration judge,"" Marks said.

That push for professional diversification carried through the Biden administration. That administration selected as immigration judges not just immigration attorneys, but also criminal defense attorneys, other administrative judges across the federal government, and those with military experience, as it sought to diversify the perspectives of those interpreting the complicated set of immigration laws.

Marks said that the president and his cabinet will continue to affect personnel decisions as long as these courts stay in the executive branch.

""It's common sense that the boss of the prosecutor should not be the boss of the judge,"" Marks said, recalling the fight to keep immigration courts separate from immigration enforcement when DHS was created in 2002. Enforcement, which is primarily ICE, was separated from the DOJ.",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ffe28f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x924+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F78%2F5be5cce14d39a7f503d1a430f419%2Ffedagenst.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:03:36.868875

Ortiz said her husband Vicente doesn't have a criminal history. She said he was in the process of obtaining immigration status through his marriage to her. She's a U.S. citizen and they've been married for three years.

""He's the most amazing, kind, sweet hearted man you could ever meet, he would literally give someone his shirt off his back to make sure they weren't cold,"" Ortiz said.

The arrest comes after the Trump administration suggested the tactic of getting arrest numbers up by targeting retail outlets.

The Wall Street Journal reported that top Trump aide Stephen Miller directed ICE to ""just go out there and arrest illegal aliens."" He also told agents to target Home Depots and 7-Elevens.

KING 5 saw that happen in Redmond last week as well; ICE agents arrested a father as he was leaving Home Depot.

As for the Ortiz family, his daughter is desperate to have her father back.

""Vicente is not my biological father but I grew up thinking that wasn't something I was going to get, and he showed me that,"" Alexandrea Ortiz said. ""That was something I deserved, that I could rely on a father. I never thought the whole father-daughter relationship, being a daddy's girl was something I was going to get, and he made it possible for me.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/0c53fcdd-fe7f-4400-bbcd-40f3026e7f4b/20251111T010922/0c53fcdd-fe7f-4400-bbcd-40f3026e7f4b_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 02:56:46.251865

“In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said.
“In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings.
Yet the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County requires members of the press and public to seek permission up to 48 hours in advance to attend any delinquency hearing, and to specifically identify the juvenile involved.
For example, MLK50 reporter Rebecca Cadenhead has sought access to juvenile court hearings in part to report on how the court is operating since the 2018 end of a federal oversight period that had been required by a 2012 settlement between Shelby County and the U.S. Department of Justice following a DOJ investigation concluding the Shelby County Juvenile Court discriminated against Black youth.","Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Local Legal Initiative attorney Paul McAdoo is representing a Tennessee news media coalition in a new lawsuit challenging access restrictions to certain juvenile court proceedings in Shelby County, arguing they unlawfully impede news coverage of the justice system and stifle public oversight of the court.

On behalf of MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, the Daily Memphian’s publisher Memphis Fourth Estate, The Commercial Appeal’s publisher Memphis Publishing, and Memphis television station WREG’s owner and operator Nexstar Media Group, Reporters Committee attorneys are asking the Shelby County Chancery Court to block the enforcement of a policy that requires members of the press and public to obtain advance permission from the county’s juvenile court before attending delinquency hearings, which are presumptively open to the public pursuant to court rule.

“In Tennessee, court rules are clear that juvenile delinquency proceedings should be open by default,” McAdoo said. “In Shelby County, however, the juvenile court has put in place a requirement that shuts the door on reporters who are there to attend delinquency proceedings. This unlawful policy deprives the public of timely, accurate information about how the court is handling the cases that come before it, particularly at a time when Shelby County is incarcerating more children than in recent years.”

While the rules that govern access to Tennessee’s juvenile courts allow for some types of proceedings to be closed, those rules explicitly state that delinquency cases are presumptively open to the public. The rules specify a process the court must follow in order to close a delinquency proceeding, which requires the court to, among other things, “make adequate written findings to support any order of closure” on a case-by-case basis.

Yet the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County requires members of the press and public to seek permission up to 48 hours in advance to attend any delinquency hearing, and to specifically identify the juvenile involved. The lawsuit argues that this advance permission policy renders these proceedings presumptively closed, including when a hearing itself is not scheduled more than 48 hours in advance, or a journalist is not made aware of it within that timeframe or does not know the name of the specific juvenile involved.

The lawsuit also details multiple instances in which reporters have been barred from accessing hearings due to the policy, either because their advance requests were not answered until after a hearing took place or because they’ve been explicitly denied.

For example, MLK50 reporter Rebecca Cadenhead has sought access to juvenile court hearings in part to report on how the court is operating since the 2018 end of a federal oversight period that had been required by a 2012 settlement between Shelby County and the U.S. Department of Justice following a DOJ investigation concluding the Shelby County Juvenile Court discriminated against Black youth. According to the legal filings, Cadenhead has twice been prevented from observing the court’s current practices — once when her request to attend was not answered until nearly two weeks after the hearing at issue, and once when it was expressly denied — and thus has not attempted to attend a proceeding since, which she claims has posed “significant challenges” to her reporting.

This lawsuit is the most recent case in which McAdoo is helping Tennessee news organizations push for transparency in the state’s criminal justice system.",https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2x1-State-Names-Tennessee-e1746637932449.png,N,,2025-11-11 03:57:40.035974

Hassan M Ahmad, a lawyer from the California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-CA), and the Muslim Legal Fund of America (MLFA) said in a statement on Monday that the journalist and commentator was punished for his criticism of Israel during his US speaking tour and not for any alleged wrongdoing.

“It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” Hussam Ayloush, the CEO of CAIR’s California chapter, said in a statement.

“His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”

“The immigration charging document filed in his case alleged only a visa overstay—after the government revoked his visa without cause and without prior notice—and never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds,” Hamdi’s legal representatives said in the joint statement.

Hamdi’s wife, Soumaya Hamdi, welcomed the news in a series of posts on social media, saying, “Sami is coming home, alhamdullilah. Elated doesn’t begin to describe the feeling.”

She also expressed her “heartfelt gratitude” to the “countless wonderful people” who offered assistance during her husband’s detention.

A number of institutions raised concerns about Hamdi’s treatment, including his former university, the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, and freedom of expression organisation PEN America.

By contrast, some people openly advocated for Hamdi to be detained, including far-right activist and Donald Trump ally Laura Loomer, who celebrated Hamdi’s detention and repeatedly claimed he was going to be deported, without citing her sources.

Loomer, a self-described “proud Islamophobe”, also accused Hamdi of supporting Islamic terrorism, without providing any evidence.

Responding to allegations about his son, Hamdi’s father, Mohamed El-Hachmi Hamdi, said in a post on X that he “has no affiliation” with any political or religious group.

“His stance on Palestine is not aligned with any faction there, but rather, with the people’s right to security, peace, freedom and dignity. He is, quite simply, one of the young dreamers of this generation, yearning for a world with more compassion, justice, and solidarity,” he added.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has targeted a number of pro-Palestinian advocates, even as it has also worked to mediate a precarious truce agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Those targeted include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian former student of Columbia University. who continues to face challenges to his US immigration status after being freed from detention in June.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sam_hamdi_and_child-1762459545.jpg?resize=1752%2C1080,N,,2025-11-11 00:56:40.566473

“The government has agreed to release Sami,” the family said in a statement on Monday.
“He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.” Hamdi was detained on 26 October at San Francisco international airport.
“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” Cair said.
“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”","The family of British political commentator Sami Hamdi, who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in late October while on a speaking tour in the US, say he is set to be released and will be able to “return home soon”.

“The government has agreed to release Sami,” the family said in a statement on Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”

Hamdi was detained on 26 October at San Francisco international airport. At the time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said his detention appeared to be in retaliation for the Muslim political commentator’s criticism of Israel while touring the US, calling it a “blatant affront to free speech”, and called for his release.

Later on 26 October, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said that Hamdi’s visa had been revoked and that he was in “ICE custody pending removal”.

“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin said.

In a separate statement that same day, the state department said that the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity”.

The Guardian reported last month that the US officials appeared to be referencing remarks Hamdi made following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, as on 27 October, the DHS shared a video clip by the pro-Israel group Memri, in which Hamdi was recorded saying that Palestinians should “celebrate their victory” and asked if they had felt “euphoria” over what had taken place.

Hamdi later sought to clarify his remarks. In another speaking engagement several days after the Hamas attacks he said: “We don’t celebrate blood lust, we don’t celebrate death and we don’t celebrate war” adding that “what Muslims are celebrating is not war, they’re celebrating the revival of a cause – a just cause – that everybody thought was dead, this is an important distinction … I don’t celebrate war, I don’t celebrate death.”

In an interview with the Guardian in late October, Hamdi’s wife called the allegations against her husband “outrageous” and said the videos were “edited in a way to frame Sami in a horrible light and produced by an organization that is very well known to be anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, Islamophobic and out there to target people who are speaking up against the genocide against Palestinians”.

On Monday, the California chapter of Cair, whose legal team has been representing Hamdi in court along with attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America and The HMA Law Firm, confirmed in a statement that Hamdi had accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily.

They added that the immigration charging document filed “in his case alleged only a visa overstay – after the government revoked his visa without cause and without prior notice – and never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds”.

“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” Cair said.

However, McLaughlin of DHS said in a statement: “Sami Hamdi, an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer who cheered on Hamas following its October 7 terrorist attack, requested voluntary departure and ICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.

LCCRSF and other civil groups argue that the federal government made this change without making changes to its procedures and practices “necessary for longer-term incarceration,” like making bedding, medication or hygiene products available to detainees.
The court did not make a decision on Monday, but the next scheduled hearing is set for Dec. 9.","Civil rights advocates argued in federal court on Monday that immigrants are being detained in unacceptable conditions in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in downtown San Francisco.

Asylum seekers and others detained while showing up for their immigration court date have been kept for days at a time in rooms meant to hold people for less than 12 hours, according to advocates.

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area — one of the groups that has sued the federal government — said that this practice violates both federal law and the Constitution, and it is asking the court to provide immediate relief to detained immigrants.

The lawsuit alleges that ICE has kept immigrants detained at the 630 Sansome St. holding site in “a state of sleep deprivation.” Plaintiffs say they were forced to sleep on either the floor or metal benches, with only a sheet of plastic for cover in cold rooms where the lights were kept on 24 hours a day.

“These spaces cannot hold people safely for more than 12 hours, fundamentally, as a matter of operations and a matter of physical layout,” LCCRSF attorney Marissa Hatton declared at federal court in San José.

One plaintiff, Martin Hernandez Torres, told lawyers that federal agents deprived him of his blood pressure medication while he was detained overnight, resulting in a hypertensive crisis that may have left him with permanent brain damage.

For years, ICE has kept individuals awaiting deportation or a hearing in hold rooms like the one in downtown San Francisco for up to 12 hours at a time — as required by the agency’s own standards.

But as it ramped up operations under the Trump administration in recent months, ICE leadership issued a waiver in June for its own rule and allowed for detentions of up to several days.

LCCRSF and other civil groups argue that the federal government made this change without making changes to its procedures and practices “necessary for longer-term incarceration,” like making bedding, medication or hygiene products available to detainees.

Officials with ICE said their agencies do not comment on pending litigation, but the attorney representing the federal government, Douglas Earl Johns, told Biden-appointed Judge P. Casey Pitts that the waiver to the 12-hour rule “is applied operationally on an individual basis.”

Earlier this year, several members of Congress and immigrant justice groups in New York similarly accused ICE of keeping immigrants detained in “inhumane conditions” after detaining them at their court hearings.

Civil rights groups are asking the court to freeze ICE’s waiver of its 12-hour rule and require federal agents to provide detained individuals with basic medical screenings, prescribed medication and improve overall conditions in the holding rooms.

The court did not make a decision on Monday, but the next scheduled hearing is set for Dec. 9.

“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.

Hamdi was detained at San Francisco International Airport on October 26, a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.

On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention.

“If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”

Hamdi is known for his analysis on developments in the Middle East and appearances on British TV. He had recently spoken about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance.

At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, Hamdi called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” However, in a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right.”

“People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians,” he said.

“Unlike the Democrats — who perpetuated the longest government shutdown in American history— ICE law enforcement officers are hard at work for the American people,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “While Americans were enjoying their weekends, our brave ICE law enforcement were arresting child rapists, murderers, kidnappers, robbers, and drug traffickers. President Trump and Secretary Noem’s message is clear: If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, you WILL be arrested and deported. And you will NEVER return.”

Arrests include:

Manuel Emilio Lora-Troncoso, a criminal illegal alien from the Dominican Republic, convicted for two counts of rape of a child with force and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 years old in Woburn, Massachusetts.

Background

A requested poll of the court failed to produce a majority of judges in regular active service and not disqualified who voted in favor of rehearing en banc.

Analysis

Judges King, Gregory, Wynn, Thacker, Benjamin and Berner voted to grant rehearing en banc. Chief Judge Diaz and judges Wilkinson, Niemeyer, Agee, Harris, Quattlebaum, Rushing and Heytens voted to deny rehearing en banc. Judge Richardson did not participate.

Petition for rehearing en banc denied.

Dissenting opinion

King, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:

The exceptionally important issue that our en banc court should have addressed is whether a bankruptcy court can possess subject-matter jurisdiction over a bankruptcy proceeding involving fully-solvent corporate entities who lack any semblance of financial distress? Put most simply, the answer should emphatically be NO.

Our en banc court has blundered in declining to recognize that there is simply a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for Bestwall to maintain its manufactured sham Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And it does so at the expense of thousands of plaintiffs that are seeking tort relief in the Nation’s civil courts against the likes of New Georgia-Pacific and Bestwall. Because we should have convened as an en banc court and recognized that Bestwall’s manufactured sham Chapter 11 bankruptcy is subject to dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, I respectfully dissent.",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2021/10/VLW-digital-product-mockup-for-Facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:57:50.510714

National Domestic Violence Hotline: People who have experienced domestic abuse can get confidential help at thehotline.org or by calling 800-799-7233.

The immigrant from India believed her husband when he said that if she wasn’t gone by the time he got to their Georgia home in 10 minutes, he would kill her.

She said her husband and his family, who are also immigrants, abused her throughout their marriage, beating her with a belt, pouring hot water on her, cutting her, and pushing her head through a wall.

“Several times I tried to escape, but they found me and brought me back home,” said the woman, who is in the country illegally and spoke on the condition of anonymity because she is afraid being identified would harm her chances of gaining legal status.

With no time to run after her husband’s call in July 2020, she dialed 911, even though she knew she could be deported. The police arrived to find the husband threatening her with a knife in front of their young children, she recalled. He was arrested but not prosecuted, she said.

The woman and her children sought services from the Tahirih Justice Center, a national nonprofit organization that serves immigrant survivors of gender-based violence. She is still winding through the immigration process five years later.

Besides immigrants’ increased vulnerability to sexual violence, they face a host of mental health and physical challenges, researchers say. They have high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and anxiety, according to a 2024 study.

“Personally, I know anxiety related to the current political climate is precipitating expensive emergency room visits and negatively impacting people’s ability to get to work and make a living,” said Nicole E. Warren, a nurse midwife and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore.

Immigrants without legal status also face increased rates of chronic conditions and higher death rates from preventable diseases due to their limited access to health care and their fear of seeking it, advocates say.

“One of our clients was so afraid to leave her home that she avoided seeking medical care during her pregnancy, out of fear of interacting with ICE,” said Miriam Camero, director of client advocacy, social services, at Tahirih.

Food banks have reported that many immigrants in need of food assistance have stopped coming, for fear of deportation.

It has always been difficult for people without legal immigration status to get help when they need it. The Trump administration’s crackdown on people in the country illegally has intensified the pressure. The situation has also hampered the advocates and attorneys who defend their rights.

“We’re working extra hours to do all the work,” said Vanessa Wilkins, executive director of Tahirih’s office in Atlanta. “The safety planning and added protection that clients might need, including documents just to make sure they are safe, can definitely make you feel overwhelmed.”

U Visas

For domestic abuse survivors without legal status, like the woman from India, going to the authorities seems more fraught amid the immigration crackdown, said Maricarmen Garza, chief counsel of the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic & Sexual Violence.

“There are just no guarantees,” Garza said, “especially with how law enforcement is intertwined in enforcing immigration law.”

In more than half of states, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can collaborate by formal written agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove people in the country illegally. Advocates say this can interfere with victims’ efforts to get a certificate to file for a “U visa,” which would allow them to live and work in the U.S. with the possibility of lawful permanent residency.

The battered woman from India recalls police telling her that if she did not press charges, she could get a certificate for a U visa. She agreed to their suggestion but recalls the anxiety of filing about five abuse reports over two years to get the certificate. “I got panic attacks just writing them down, because it meant I was reliving the situations again,” she said.

When asked for comment about the difficulties immigrant domestic violence victims face, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson touted President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. “The president’s successful effort to deport criminal illegal aliens is making all victims safer and ensuring they will never again be harmed by dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” Jackson said in a statement. She said “allegations without evidence” that immigrants have been told to drop charges “should not be taken seriously.”

Immigrant women without legal status can be particularly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation because of language barriers, as well as cultural and social isolation, researchers have found.

According to a 2023 report, lifetime rates of abuse by intimate partners range up to 93% in some immigrant groups, compared with about 41% of U.S.-born women experiencing such abuse in their lifetime.

As the Trump administration reshapes the country’s immigration system, survivors of violence who entered the country illegally have a tough time proving their abuse and trauma to get relief, advocates say.

A refugee health and asylum program at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore provides immigrant victims of abuse with free forensic evaluations to support their claims for humanitarian relief, including applications for U visas.

Warren, the program’s associate director for women’s health, said that in the past, a written affidavit of the clinic’s findings was enough to corroborate an applicant’s legal accounts of past trauma.

“Now, we are getting requests for our in-person testimony,” Warren said.

Application Backlogs

The woman from India applied for a visa after she received a certificate from law enforcement allowing her to do so in 2023. Hers is one of nearly 11.6 million pending visa applications, according to data through June — the highest volume of cases ever recorded by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The number of pending U visa applications is 415,000, according to the agency.

Only about 10,000 U visas are issued per year, and it can take more than seven years to process applications, Garza said.

Adding to the pressure, the Trump administration has reduced the availability of Section 8 housing, which helps low-income individuals and others pay their rent. As of September, people without legal authorization to be in the United States are not eligible to receive rental help over U.S. citizens.

“If Tahirih wasn’t behind me, I could be homeless,” said the woman, who said she can afford only half her rent.

Victims’ advocates say they are working harder than ever to support their clients but are stretched thin as they face federal funding cuts and increased demand.

The Tahirih center reported a 200% increase in call volume in the four months after Trump took office, compared with the same period last year.

“At the end of the day there are a lot of emails and a lot of people we aren’t able to reach as quickly as in the past,” said Casey Carter Swegman, the center’s director of public policy.

To reach immigrant survivors of abuse who are afraid to come forward, advocates are “getting back to basics,” said Joanna Otero-Cruz, executive director and president of the Philadelphia group Women Against Abuse.

“We’re doing grassroots outreach to hairdressers and other small-business owners,” she said. “They’re the eyes and ears for us.”

In Riverhead, New York, a 38-year-old woman who emigrated from El Salvador said she has twice been the victim of domestic abuse but was too scared to report it to police.

She said the second assault was by a man for whom she cooked and cleaned in his home. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of her sense of shame and her fears of deportation, said he raped her, took pictures of her naked, and threatened to put them on social media if she tried to go to the police. He then stalked her, she said.

Noemi Sanchez, Long Island regional coordinator for the Rural & Migrant Ministry, a nonprofit that supports farm workers, is working closely with the woman to elevate her self-esteem and help her understand that “no woman deserves to have a man mistreat them.”

Meanwhile, the survivor from India received a temporary work permit in 2024 and is employed as a certified nursing assistant, which “helps me survive,” she said.

“I have really come a long way,” she added. “It wasn’t easy. I had great support behind me. They didn’t let me down.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:57:34.830382

The Future of Federal Civil Rights Protection Administration officials may claim they are carrying out their statutory duties, but the reality is that civil rights enforcement is being stripped of its independence, expertise, and moral authority.
Future administrations will face the enormous challenge of rebuilding what the Trump Administration has dismantled in just nine short months.","Civil rights are the fundamental rights and freedoms granted to individuals and protected by the government, ensuring equal treatment free from discrimination. These rights extend to all aspects of civil life, including employment, housing, voting, education, public accommodation, and healthcare. It is the duty of our federal government, through the Constitution and laws enacted by Congress, to guarantee and safeguard these rights regardless of an individual’s sex, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. To aid in doing so, many federal agencies have internal civil rights offices to not only enforce civil rights law, but also to investigate violations made the U.S. government.

Since returning to the White House, the Trump Administration has upended nearly every civil rights office across the federal government by slashing jobs and budgets, leading to hundreds, if not thousands, of investigations left in indefinite limbo or dismissed. Meanwhile, Congress, who created these very offices and is charged with oversight of the federal government, is doing little to ensure the funding they have appropriated is used accordingly, and the offices fulfill their statutory duties.

The following examples illustrate how the Trump Administration, as part of a broader campaign against civil society and free expression, has weaponized and dismantled key watchdog offices throughout the federal government.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

In March, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would abolish three key civil rights and oversight offices within the department – the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CISOMB), and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) – suggesting the offices were a road block to immigration enforcement. These offices served the vital function of independently investigating allegations of abuse and discrimination by DHS components, including by the Transportation Security Agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection, against both American citizens and immigrants alike.

Dozens of employees in each office were fired, taking staffing levels down to the statutorily mandated minimum, often of one single employee. A whistleblower disclosure to Congress alleges that more than 500 civil rights complaints, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse, and discrimination, were abandoned when most employees were fired in March. Following a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups against DHS, the Department committed to preserve the three offices and staff both OIDO and CISOMB with five to seven employees, and CRCL with twenty – still significantly less than the original levels.

The Department of Justice

Established by Congress through the Civil Rights Act of 1957, the Justice Department’s (DOJ) Civil Rights Division (CRT) is responsible for enforcing laws that protect Americans from discrimination in voting, housing, employment, education, and policing.

Under President Trump’s pick to lead CRT, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, priorities have changed. A memo to CRTemployees directed the prioritization of investigations and enforcement in the categories of (1) combatting discrimination, (2) ending antisemitism, (3) protecting women and children, (4) ending “sanctuary” jurisdictions, and (5) the denaturalization of naturalized U.S. citizens. While some of the priorities would seemingly be appropriate, the key is what Trump’s DOJ deemsdiscriminatory or antisemitic. According to reports, CRT has moved quickly to implement these priorities and has dropped investigations and court cases in dozens of cases, some relating to racial discrimination and voting rights. In response to this significant reshaping of CRT, upwards of 300 attorneys have resigned with some offices losing 75% of their attorneys. An employeedescribed the situation as “a complete bloodbath.”

The Department of Education

In late September, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump Administration in allowing the Department of Education to lay off over half of the staff at the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). OCR is tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in public schools and universities across the country, including discrimination, sexual harassment, and hate crimes. Before President Trump returned to office, OCR was one of the largest offices at the Department, with over 500 employees and 12 regional offices across the country, receiving tens of thousands of complaints a year. Today, OCR staff has been reduced to a fraction of what it once was, at least seven of those 12 regional offices have been closed, and thousands of cases have been dismissed without investigation.

The Trump Administration has diverted significant federal resources in a quest to police free speech, particularly pro-Palestinian speech, and push its policy agenda on campuses. Under the guise of combatting antisemitism and diversity initiatives, the Administration pressured universities deemed as “insufficiently responsive to antisemitism” by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding unless they comply with the Administration’s political demands. Through coordinated investigations and funding threats, these actions have transformed civil rights enforcement from a mechanism of protection into one of political intimidation. The result is a gutted civil rights office that cannot effectively investigate complaints, leaving students vulnerable to violations of their civil rights with no recourse. Or in the alternative, the government weaponizing the charge of antisemitism against students, professors, and administration officials to shut down advocacy for Palestinian human rights.

The Future of Federal Civil Rights Protection

Administration officials may claim they are carrying out their statutory duties, but the reality is that civil rights enforcement is being stripped of its independence, expertise, and moral authority. What remains is a system designed to shield the government from accountability, and weaponize its resources against those it's meant to protect.

Civil rights are not abstract concepts, and neither are the harms when the government violates them. From harassment at airports, selective vetting for immigration benefits, and arbitrary inclusion on no-fly lists, Arab Americans are no strangers to discriminatory government practices, especially after 9/11 and the creation of DHS. Likewise, these protections are not self-sustaining. The responsibility to protect them from executive branch overreach lies with not only Congress and our judicial system, but with every American.

While these offices and previous administrations were not perfect, they are the result of decades of activism from Black, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities and other communities, to ensure equal treatment and accountability. In practice, this means that when a student faces discrimination at school, a traveler is profiled at the airport, an immigrant is disappeared, or an employee is fired for speaking out, federal investigation and enforcement now depends less on justice and more on whether the case advances the President’s political agenda. Future administrations will face the enormous challenge of rebuilding what the Trump Administration has dismantled in just nine short months.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5faecb8fb23a85370058aed8/5ffe2c7d01a1a223b362395e/6911fb63aea4c74eb0273825/1762788265434/unsplash-image-yCdPU73kGSc.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-10 17:01:35.923162

The guidance says that such people could become a “public charge” — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age.
“Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.” About 10% of the world’s population has diabetes.
“Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?” the cable asks.
They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence.","Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a Thursday directive from the Trump administration.

The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a “public charge” — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age.

While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases like tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant’s health status.

The directive is part of the Trump administration’s divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House’s crusade to push out immigrants has included daily mass arrests, bans on refugees from certain countries, and plans to severely restrict the total number permitted into the U.S.

The new guidelines mandate that immigrants’ health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said Charles Wheeler, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group.

“You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable reads. “Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.”

About 10% of the world’s population has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe’s leading killer.

The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, like obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S.

“All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.

Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government.

“Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?” the cable reads.

The cable’s language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department’s own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on “what if” scenarios, Wheeler said.

The guidance directs visa officers to develop “their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,” he said. “That’s troubling because they’re not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn’t be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.”

The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents.

“Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?” the cable asks.

Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. embassy.

They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against infectious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis B.

But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants’ medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history.

“Taking into consideration one’s diabetic history or heart health history — that’s quite expansive,” Genovese said. “There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite expansive as opining over, ‘What if someone goes into diabetic shock?’ If this change is going to happen immediately, that’s obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ce7ec1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+29/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc4%2F8e%2Fd83c9dd244aea617f198727f1930%2Fap-25027517785383-resized.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 16:05:20.959981

When ICE reached out to Indianapolis Public Schools for help, the agency “faced significant obstacles — caused by IPS policies and actions,” according to the filing.
With the lawsuit, Rokita wants the court to compel the school district’s employees to fully cooperate with immigration enforcement.
But the school district said that it has been upholding the law and will continue to do so.","Indiana’s attorney general is suing the state’s largest public school district, arguing policies at Indianapolis Public Schools are “thwarting” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation efforts.

A lawsuit filed Nov. 6 by Attorney General Todd Rokita says the school district is restricting ICE’s access to school grounds, in violation of state law, through policies that don’t allow agents to enter non-public school areas unless they have a judicial warrant or in the case of an emergency.

The district’s policies also illegally prevent school employees, according to a complaint, from helping ICE with enforcement actions.

Under what the attorney general’s office describes as the state’s “anti-sanctuary law,” the lawsuit says public employees are not to be prevented from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement measures.

“Schools across the country are vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens — it’s happened in many other states — and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe,” Rokita said in a news release .

The school district responds

In a statement critical of Rokita’s lawsuit that was shared with McClatchy News, Indianapolis Public Schools said it is “deeply offended” by the attorney general “dehumanizing our children and their families by labeling them as ‘aliens.’”

The district said it is dedicated to providing a safe environment for all students, characterizing the lawsuit as a “silly” measure motivated by a desire for “political gain.”

“While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families, and taxpayers,” the district said.

The lawsuit, which is also represented by America First Policy Institute, a conservative nonprofit foundation, mentions a specific example in which school employees were said to have gotten in the way of ICE deporting a student’s father, leading the attorney general’s office to investigate.

The father had agreed to self-deport and was scheduled to leave the U.S. on a flight on Jan. 8, according to the filing. ICE, however, did not want to force him to leave the country without his son.

ICE reported to the attorney general’s office that the man’s child “had gone to school on the morning of January 8 in apparent disregard of his father’s wish that they depart the country together that afternoon,” the complaint says.

“ICE did not wish to separate the family and therefore sought to reunite the Honduran national with his son so that they could leave the United States together,” the complaint continues.

When ICE reached out to Indianapolis Public Schools for help, the agency “faced significant obstacles — caused by IPS policies and actions,” according to the filing.

The school district said that ICE needed a judicial warrant to assist the man in taking custody of his son for deportation unless agents could show an emergency allowed for the measure, the complaint says.

Instead of working with ICE, the school’s employees are accused of connecting the child with an immigration attorney to help him stay in the U.S.

“Ultimately, IPS — instead of releasing the son to the father’s custody so that the father and son could depart the country together — released the minor to the immigration attorney at the end of the school day,” the complaint says.

The filing argues the school district’s policies caused the father to remain in the U.S. illegally because he missed his deportation flight since he was not reunited with his son.

With the lawsuit, Rokita wants the court to compel the school district’s employees to fully cooperate with immigration enforcement.

But the school district said that it has been upholding the law and will continue to do so.

Warrant needed for private areas of schools

During the start of President Donald Trump’s second presidential term in January, Trump rolled back regulations that barred immigration authorities from schools and other “sensitive” areas, McClatchy News previously reported.

Some states issued guidelines to schools in response, advising employees that ICE isn’t allowed inside school facilities unless they have a specific type of warrant.

Under federal law, for ICE to enter areas of a school that are private — such as classrooms, fenced-in school yards and administrative offices — agents need a judicial warrant, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.

The center notes that the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution “protects school administration personnel, teachers, and students from unreasonable searches and seizures, regardless of their immigration status.”

Due to Trump rolling back protections for schools and sensitive locations in January, agents can, however, visit public school areas, like parking lots or lobbies, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",https://www.mcclatchy-newsroom.com/public/l6dl7a/picture275517266/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/RTT-CourtGavel,N,,2025-11-10 17:01:59.063491

In a post on X Monday, DHS announced an undocumented immigrant from Mexico was arrested in connection with a shooting ""targeting Border Patrol agents in Chicago."" No identity was released as of Monday afternoon.

DHS said the suspect had previous convictions for unlawful use of a weapon.

""He is currently marked as a violator of the Laken Riley Act, pending charges related to assaulting officer,"" the post read.

The incident unfolded Saturday in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood.

Cell phone video taken at around noon along West 26th Street showed federal agents clashing with neighbors and what appears to be tear gas being deployed. Video showed Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on the scene, holding what appears to be a canister of tear gas.

Authorities said the incident began near West 26th Street & South Kedzie Avenue. Border Patrol agents were conducting enforcement operations when DHS said a man driving in a black Jeep fired shots at them and took off.

DHS in a statement said ""an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at border patrol’s vehicles"" and ""Chicago Police Department was called for assistance and cleared the scene, calling it a ""dynamic situation.""

The incident later spilled over to West 23rd Street and Sawyer Avenue. Chicago police officers could be seen trying to disperse the crowd. Neighbors said they heard the commotion and went outside to check and saw federal agents walking a young girl in the alley.

One woman who didn't want to show her face on camera said agents were trying to get ahold of the girl's family.

""I just stood in front of the little girl,"" one neighbor said. ""I wrapped my hands around her, I grabbed onto the fence, and I just stayed there and kept telling the agents they couldn’t grab her, she’s a minor. She doesn’t have an adult with her. I don’t know her, I'm just her neighbor.""

The girl's family told Telemundo Chicago that federal agents were looking for her father. The girl's grandmother and another neighbor said, at one point, they tried to search their building.

""They tried to come into my house...trying to say I was hiding someone, which there was no one in my house but my kids, and they insisted,"" the neighbor said. ""They got scared once I told them, 'Show me your warrant, show me your face. Why masks?'""

The girl's grandmother said her son is believed to be at the center of the investigation. He told her he was on his way to her house when the incident unfolded with federal agents.

""He said he didn’t do nothing to them,"" the grandmother said. ""He was coming out of the alley, they rammed him and they shot at him.""

As of Saturday evening, DHS said they were still looking for the alleged shooter. Chicago police said they responded to a call of shots fired at federal agents to secure the area - and that there were no reports of anyone being struck by gunfire.

Montpelier, Vt. – Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund(link is external)","New grants increase capacity of organizations providing due process to those involved in defense removal proceedings at a critical time

Vermont Business Magazine The Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund(link is external) (VILDF) today announced that it has raised more than $500,000 from over 1250 donors across the state since its launch on May 8, 2025. The organization has a goal to raise $1 million to create a sustainable immigration legal defense system in Vermont. The rapid rate of fundraising is because of a groundswell of support all over Vermont. The funds raised are from not just planned events, but also spontaneous gatherings – concerts, parties, art auctions, church gatherings – by people motivated to uphold the right to due process for all persons as it is enshrined in the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution.

VILDF is also announcing a second round of awards to four organizations providing direct legal and interpretation services to those involved in defense removal proceedings: The Vermont Asylum Assistance Project ($100,000), the Vermont Afghan Alliance ($35,900), the Association of Africans Living in Vermont ($82,875), and the Family Room ($12,000).

“Vermonters understand the right to due process isn’t a privilege – it’s a fundamental promise of our democracy. Across our state, from concerts to community suppers, people are raising their voices and contributing their hard-earned dollars to defend that promise,” said State Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who founded VILDF in his personal capacity in May. “When we look out for our neighbors, we strengthen our communities and our country. That spirit of fairness and compassion is what makes me proud to call Vermont home.”

VILDF’s Advisory Committee approved the slate of awards in early November. The Advisory Committee focused on non-profit organizations providing direct legal and interpretation services to those involved in removal proceedings. The United Way of Northwest Vermont, which manages the funds for VILDF, will make the awards.

“Vermont is leading the way in showing how we can come together,” said Senator Kesha Ram Hinsdale, who helped launch VILDF. “The newest awards are investments in the greatest needs our system faces and will help uphold the rights to which every person in our state is entitled.”

The second slate of awards will specifically support additional attorneys and other support for immigrant legal defense.

As a result of these grants, the Vermont Afghan Alliance (VAA) is shifting a significant portion of its in-house attorney time to direct legal defense cases as members of that community legally in the United States contend with removal proceedings despite their status.

The Association of Africans Living in Vermont (AALV) will be able to add to their in-house attorney case load, bring on three legal interns to support case documentation and follow up, and train a new cohort of pro bono attorney volunteers able to more sustainably provide due process during removal proceedings. Based on current activity, AALV anticipates 100 or more removal detention cases in 2025 alone.

The Family Room, which often partners with AALV, will use their grant for interpretation services when necessary for those in different stages of defense removal proceedings. This is especially critical when an attorney is not available.

VAAP’s award is its second $100,000 award from VILDF. VAAP’s first award this past summer funded the deployment of community legal support workers accessible to rural immigrant communities across Vermont, the hiring of 3 new attorney positions and one new executive coordination position (all of whom will be in place by next month), and nearly 100 pro-bono attorneys, paralegals, and interpreters trained. This translated to VAAP’s engagement in 62 removal defense cases with the VAAP attorney as the attorney of record, 27 additional detained clients assisted with at least limited scope representation, and the litigation of 10 bond hearings and 5 habeas/temporary restraining (TRO) actions.

VAAP’s actions mean individuals are less likely to face detention or deportation alone. VILDF’s Advisory Committee has confidence that VAAP’s actions will help Vermont move toward a more sustainable system of legal defense. As a condition of these awards, all grantees are committing to consult with VAAP as Vermont builds a stronger community of practice for immigrant legal defense. For more information about VAAP, please see https://www.vaapvt.org(link is external)

As VAAP executive director, Jill Martin Diaz reflects, “When we walk into Vermont facilities for legal intake, we still see the basics denied: a single landline for multiple volunteer lawyers is not language access, and removal orders entered ‘in absentia’ because custodians fail to produce detainees for remote hearings is not due process. With historic support from the Vermont Immigrant Legal Defense Fund (VILDF), VAAP is mobilizing supervised volunteers inside these facilities to course-correct in real time for people at immediate risk and to maintain the precedent of democratic rule of law for all.”

“For more than a decade, AALV has been proud to serve Vermont’s diverse community by supporting vulnerable noncitizens and ensuring they have access to essential services,” said Nathan Virag, Immigration Attorney at AALV. “With the generous support of the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, we continue our work providing direct legal defense and representation for individuals facing removal proceedings, as well as advocacy in federal court for the release of detainees. As the needs of our community evolve, AALV remains committed to standing alongside those impacted by changing immigration policies and working with our partners throughout Vermont to ensure that every member of our community is treated with dignity and fairness.”

""What we've witnessed over the last year has been absolutely heartbreaking. Some Afghan allies who risked their lives in support of U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Afghanistan, detained by ICE and a government meant to protect them,” said Molly Gray, Executive Director of the VAA. “The VT Afghan Alliance is grateful to the Fund's founders, and to all Vermonters who have contributed to this effort. With the Fund's support, the Alliance will help protect the due process rights of our new neighbors and try to prevent deportation and ultimately persecution at the hands of the Taliban.""

“United Way exists to meet the needs our community tells us matter most – and Vermonters have spoken clearly,” said United Way of Northwest Vermont CEO Jesse Bridges. “As fiscal sponsor of the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund, we’re proud to leverage our capacity to help raise resources and partner with trusted organizations to impact our community. This is trust-based philanthropy in action, and it’s how we meet the moment with responsiveness and dignity.”

“As I read this MOU and the executive order I do believe that they are consistent,” said James Benjamin, who is the attorney for Baltimore County.
But there are sharp differences of opinion about whether that executive order and the MOU with ICE can coexist.
Don Mohler, who was Kamenetz’s chief of staff when he signed the executive order in 2017, said the MOU approved by County Executive Kathy Klausmeier’s administration remains true to Kamenetz’s order.
Mohler said, “All of the approaches taken by County Executive Kamenetz, County Executive Olszewski, County Executive Klausmeier, have all been designed to be constitutionally solid and common sense approaches to public safety.” At last week’s protest there was anger that the county would cut any kind of deal with ICE.","In 2017, then-Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz signed an executive order, in part to protect immigrants who are in the county jail from federal authorities.

That order remains in place.

But there are those who believe that executive order is threatened by a recently signed agreement between the county and Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE.

The order states that no one in the county jail will be detained beyond their court-ordered release date unless there is a criminal warrant signed by a judicial official.

During the 2017 signing ceremony for the order Kamenetz said that “the existence of a written executive order is going to give people in the community assurances and security.”

Fast forward to 2025 and Baltimore County says there is nothing new here. The Memorandum of Understanding or MOU with ICE puts on paper what they’ve been doing at the county jail since last year.

“As I read this MOU and the executive order I do believe that they are consistent,” said James Benjamin, who is the attorney for Baltimore County.

The MOU says the county must contact ICE before someone with a federal immigration detainer or a judicial warrant is released. Then ICE will decide whether it will take custody of the inmate.

But there are sharp differences of opinion about whether that executive order and the MOU with ICE can coexist.

David Rocah, senior staff attorney with the Maryland American Civil Liberties Union, said the 2024 policy that the MOU is tied to states that the county can hold inmates for ICE beyond their release date, either up to four hours or two days depending on the type of detainer.

Speaking at a rally against the MOU in Towson last week, Rocah called it a betrayal of Kamenetz’s executive order.

“Baltimore County has no authority, none, to detain people for ICE after a judge or a jury orders their release,” Rocah said. “That’s unconstitutional.”

A county spokesman said as a practice no one is being held in the county jail beyond their release date.

Rocah said another problem with the MOU is that the county is making promises with ICE it can’t keep about notification of inmate release dates because they often are not known in advance.

“They may be released on conditions, or released on their own recognizance, or the charges may be dismissed or they may have a trial and are acquitted,"" Rocah said in an interview.

Cori Alonso-Yoder, assistant professor of law and the director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland’s Carey School of Law, said the people most likely to get snagged by the county’s MOU with ICE aren’t the ones who are living in the U.S. without permission, but those who are playing by the rules, and therefore are on ICE’s radar screen.

“I think that’s part of the trouble with the way this policy is being laid out is there’s this diffusion of individual enforcement against folks who are likely not the ones who are most dangerous to the community,” Alonso-Yoder said.

Kamenetz died in 2018. Don Mohler, who was Kamenetz’s chief of staff when he signed the executive order in 2017, said the MOU approved by County Executive Kathy Klausmeier’s administration remains true to Kamenetz’s order.

Mohler said, “All of the approaches taken by County Executive Kamenetz, County Executive Olszewski, County Executive Klausmeier, have all been designed to be constitutionally solid and common sense approaches to public safety.”

At last week’s protest there was anger that the county would cut any kind of deal with ICE. There were signs that said things like “Democracy Not Dictatorship” and “Neighbors Not Targets.”

“We should not encourage masked individuals with heavy weapons to enter our public buildings, our schools, our faith-based institutions, our places or worship,” said Baltimore County Councilman Izzy Patoka, a Democrat. “That is not what we ought to be agreeing to. But folks I think that's what we agreed to.""

But the county says that is not what was agreed to.

Klausmeier’s press secretary, Dakarai Turner, said Patoka is weaponizing misinformation for political purposes.

“The mere suggestion that this agreement invites masked and armed people into our schools or places of worship evokes disturbing imagery and stirs painful memories,” Turner said in a statement. “Spreading misinformation does nothing to make people safe, it is instead a disservice to the people of Baltimore County and a devaluation of responsible discourse.”

The county points out that the MOU is not a 287G agreement. That’s when local police officers are in essence deputized to help with federal immigration enforcement. That is not happening.

The driver for the county to sign the MOU is the threat of losing federal money, because earlier this year the county landed on the Justice Department’s list of sanctuary jurisdictions. It gets about $400 million a year from the feds, which makes up roughly nine percent of its revenue.

County attorney Benjamin said. “There was concern obviously about impacts to federal funding so we wanted to work and be able to memorialize what has already been in place so that way we’ll be able to get off the list.”

County Executive Klausmeier says it never should have been on the sanctuary jurisdiction list. Officials say it happened because ICE thought the county was ignoring its immigration detainers when in fact ICE was sending them to the wrong agencies.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4ad810/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x924+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fc4%2F6265a48d465c96773cf9f4d24f73%2Fkamenetz.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 17:57:13.704868

According to a recent announcement, Baltimore County has been removed from a list of localities that were designated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as sanctuary jurisdictions. The press release from Baltimore County shares that a recent memorandum of understanding between the county and DHS clarifies county procedures that have been in place since before the current federal administration took over.

As previously covered on Conduit Street, DHS published an initial list in August that included eight counties and Baltimore City but that list was quickly removed following backlash from a number of associations including the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA). Since that time the list was revised leaving just Baltimore County as the only location in Maryland, but has now been removed.

Following the original DHS announcement, members of the NSA – many of whom manage local law enforcement and corrections in the listed jurisdictions – responded immediately in a statement reiterating their disappointment and a need for better coordination and communication from DHS:

This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label. The completion and publication of this list has not only violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement, but it also has the potential to strain the relationship between Sheriffs and the White House administration. This is an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement and the enforcement of the rule of law at a time when that unity is needed most.

Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, is home to some 650,000 people, roughly 1 in 9 of whom were born outside the United States.
He confirmed to Bolts after his victory that he intends to terminate the 287(g) agreement once he enters office.
Partnerships with ICE, and 287(g) agreements in particular, have been a flashpoint in sheriff’s elections since the first Trump administration.
“I don’t know anybody that has called the police since this 287(g) has passed,” Lawton told Bolts.","Angela Staffareni, an organizer and immigrant advocate in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, became a citizen in October and promptly registered to vote for the first time. She awoke Wednesday “full of hope and happiness” because Sheriff Fred Harran, a Republican who has closely partnered with ICE, had been defeated, thanks in part to her vote.

“We finally have a little change,” Staffareni told Bolts. “I know ICE will still be here, but at least in our community we get some sense of peace. People haven’t wanted to go church, to concerts, to public events, because everybody is thinking they’re going to be taken.”

Many in this county were outraged when Harran in April signed an agreement to assist federal immigration authorities through ICE’s 287(g) program. Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, is home to some 650,000 people, roughly 1 in 9 of whom were born outside the United States.

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, local and state agencies across the country have rushed in huge numbers to aid his deportation campaign by joining 287(g), which authorizes local law enforcement officers to act as federal immigration agents. The agreement in Bucks County granted Harran’s deputies the power to question the immigration status of people they encounter and to serve and execute arrest warrants on ICE’s behalf.

Harran faced pushback from his own county’s commissioners, who argued he had no authority to sign the contract. He also faced a lawsuit from the ACLU and protests from angry residents. And his Democratic challenger, Danny Ceisler, a 33-year-old attorney and Army veteran, spoke up against the ICE partnership, putting the issue at the center of his campaign.

Ceisler defeated Harran by 11 percentage points last week, a margin of roughly 25,000 votes. He confirmed to Bolts after his victory that he intends to terminate the 287(g) agreement once he enters office.

“It makes immigrant communities afraid to call the police,” Ceisler said. “You’re talking about some of the most vulnerable members of society, who not only need to be able to call the police for their own protection, but to report crime, which affects everybody.”

Ceisler hopes officials in other parts of the country are watching. “It sends a message to elected public safety leaders across the country that partnering with ICE is a loser in any district that’s remotely a swing district,” he said.

Bucks County is about as politically competitive as can be, with Trump carrying it by 274 votes out of nearly 400,000 last fall, but on Tuesday the local Democratic Party experienced a triumphant night beyond Ceisler. Amid high turnout for a municipal cycle, Democrats also won the district attorney election for the first time since the 1960s, flipped the controller’s office, and solidified their power on local school boards that as recently as 2023 were banning books and pride flags.

Bucks County stood out this fall as a rare sheriff’s race with immigration enforcement at the forefront. Partnerships with ICE, and 287(g) agreements in particular, have been a flashpoint in sheriff’s elections since the first Trump administration. In past cycles, Democrats who have promised to end these agreements have flipped sheriff’s offices from Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) and Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina, to Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

But that energy was largely absent this year, in part because relatively few sheriff’s offices were on the ballot across the country. (There’ll be hundreds of sheriff’s races next year, including in counties that contract with ICE.) Some GOP sheriffs who’ve helped ICE did stand for re-election this year in competitive counties but faced no Democratic opponents, frustrating immigrants’ rights advocates, including in Erie County (Buffalo), New York, and Chesapeake, Virginia.

Sheriffs in Pennsylvania have limited powers compared to those in other states, so Bucks County was an unlikely host for the year’s sheriff election most defined by immigration enforcement.

In most of the rest of the country, sheriffs run jails and very often perform at least some patrol work. The 287(g) program empowers law enforcement officers to conduct tasks associated with immigration enforcement in those settings, during everyday police work or when people are booked in jail, which makes the program pipeline to deportation.

But the Bucks County sheriff’s office does not run the local jail. It also doesn’t run regular patrols, as daily police work here is conducted by 39 town and city departments. (The Trump administration has revived a 287(g) model that empowers local police to stop and question people about immigration status during patrols; no department in Bucks County participates in this program.) The office’s main responsibilities include staffing local courts, conducting evictions, serving warrants, and transporting incarcerated people to and from their court appearances.

Ceisler said the 287(g) agreement in Bucks County had the greatest potential for impact in the execution of bench warrants, more than 5,000 of which are outstanding there today.

“The reality is I can’t stop ICE itself from coming into the county,” Ceisler said. “What I can do is prevent the 17 deputies who were trained to be de facto ICE agents from doing that work.”

Immigrant advocates say Ceisler’s win is significant for reasons beyond the details of the current 287(g) arrangement.

“Harran saying he was going to collaborate was more than enough to create this fear in the community,” said Andrea Lawton, an activist originally from Guatemala, who runs a 600-member WhatsApp group in Doylestown, the seat of Bucks County.

She said that many who are vulnerable to immigration enforcement do not distinguish among local agencies. Just knowing that the sheriff’s office was involved with ICE in this way, she said, made people in her network distrustful of all police—even though the sheriff’s office is the only law enforcement agency in Bucks County currently involved in the 287(g) program.

“I don’t know anybody that has called the police since this 287(g) has passed,” Lawton told Bolts. “Because they don’t trust them. Domestic violence and labor abuse and all kinds of things are happening and nobody’s going to help.”

In part out of fear of Harran’s office, people in Lawton’s WhatsApp network have lately reported not wanting to go to work, take kids to school, or appear in court. Trump’s re-election fundamentally changed daily life in the county for many, she said, and the sheriff’s willing collaboration only heightened the concern. Lawton has been a citizen since 2006, but even she moves more carefully these days.

“We are the workforce of this county and they’ve been after all of us,” Lawton said.

“Everybody in kitchens in Doylestown are Latinos,” she added, “mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico. All the pizzerias here, all the restaurants, landscaping, cleaning, construction. People are posting on the group that they don’t want to leave their houses, they don’t want to attend activities, because they’re afraid.” She continued in Spanish, “Es un ambiente de miedo.”

Ceisler told Bolts that he has appointed Heidi Roux, director of a local legal aid group called Immigrant Rights Action, to his transition team, and he promised to meet with affected groups as he shapes plans before being sworn into office in January.

Lawton feels encouraged by this. “One person doesn’t have all the power,” she said. “The community has to be united because things are going to continue the way they were. We’re still under the Trump administration, but at least we have hope. Just give us hope.”",https://boltsmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image-from-iOS-scaled-e1762801257284.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 18:57:18.141519

“The American people want us to stand and fight for health care,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Federal workers get a reprieve The package seeks to roll back some of the Trump administration’s shutdown-related hits to the federal workforce.
“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits” Jeffries said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track Monday after a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to break the impasse in what has become a deepening disruption of federal programs and services, the longest in history.

What’s in and out of the bipartisan deal drew sharp criticism and leaves few senators fully satisfied. The legislation provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs, while also ensuring backpay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt.

But notably lacking is any clear resolution to expiring health care subsidies that Democrats have been fighting for as millions of Americans stare down rising insurance premiums. That debate was pushed off for a vote next month, weeks before the subsidies are set to expire.

President Donald Trump noted the deal as he arrived at the White House after watching the Washington Commanders’ game on Sunday evening against the Detroit Lions, on the 40th day of the funding lapse. “It looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending,” he said.

The Senate could wrap up passage as soon as Monday. The bill cleared a procedural hurdle, 60-40, late Sunday, with eight Democrats joining most Republicans. In a rare dissent, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against because it failed to fully address the health care funds.

It would next go to the House, where lawmakers have been away since September but were being told to prepare to return to Washington this week. Then, it’s to Trump’s desk for his signature.

Here’s a look at the deal as it’s moving through Congress:

Funding to reopen the government, for now

Included is funding to keep much of the federal government running for the next couple of months, to Jan. 30, with a stopgap measure. It largely funds government operations at their current rates.

Yet in a breakthrough for what’s considered a more normal appropriations process, the package also includes several bills to fully fund other government operations including agricultural programs and military construction along with veterans’ affairs for the full fiscal year, through September 2026.

Additionally, the package ensures states would be reimbursed for money they spent to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, running during the shutdown.

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said she was “relieved.”

“This shutdown has gone on far too long,” she said. “And I also think it’s highly significant that we’ll have three yearlong appropriations bills attached. Veterans Day is coming very soon, and it would be wonderful if we get the full-year Veterans Affairs bill signed into law.”

Health care funding still up for debate

The Democrats failed to secure their main demand during the shutdown, which was an extension of the health care subsidies that many of the 24 million people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act rely on to help defray costs.

Instead, the package guarantees a vote on the issue in December — which was not enough for most of the Democrats, who rejected the deal and voted against it.

“The American people want us to stand and fight for health care,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Federal workers get a reprieve

The package seeks to roll back some of the Trump administration’s shutdown-related hits to the federal workforce. Employees have faced repeated threats of firings and mass layoffs this year.

The stopgap measure reinstates federal workers who had received reductions in force, or layoff, notices and protects against such future actions.

It also would provide back pay for federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown — something that’s traditionally provided but that the Trump administration had threatened was not guaranteed.

Getting the bill to the president’s desk

Political and procedural hurdles remain as Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, slogs through more voting and the shutdown entered its 41st day Monday.

Senators hope to skip past a series of steps that could drag voting out all week if the dissenters put up a prolonged fight.

One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against advancing the package Sunday, and he is said to have concerns over a hemp industry provision. And three ultra-conservative GOP senators held up voting for more than two hours as they demanded consideration of their ideas. It is unclear if any of them plans to stage further protests.

Democrats, who have fought for the past month in their hopes of preserving the health care subsidies, also could delay final passage, and their next steps are uncertain.

And the package faces fresh scrutiny once it goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana holds a slim GOP majority and would likely need almost all Republicans to support the bill in the face of objections from Democrats who are holding out for the health care funds.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the party will fight the bill, forcing the Republicans in the House to pass it largely on their own.

“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits” Jeffries said. “Donald Trump and the Republican Party own the toxic mess they have created.”

It leaves one of his biggest policy initiatives hanging in the balance.

While upholding the tariffs would mark a vast expansion of presidential power, striking them down could unleash a host of dilemmas for Trump — from mass payouts to finding new legal authority to push his priorities across the line.

What would await the administration, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, is “a mess.”

Refunds for companies

The Trump administration has acknowledged that a Supreme Court loss would mean refunds of the billions in tariff revenue already collected.

It convinced lower courts to pause their rulings invalidating the tariffs in part because of concerns the refunds could be issued, only for the Supreme Court to potentially declare the tariffs legal and make it difficult to claw back the cash.

Refunds for the group of small businesses challenging Trump’s tariffs at the high court would be the most straightforward; the administration already agreed to pay them back if it loses.

As for the others, Neal Katyal, who represented the businesses at the argument, told Barrett “it’s a very complicated thing” that involves formal protests and administrative procedures.

“So, a mess?” Barrett responded.

Katyal replied, “So, it’s difficult, absolutely.”

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Fox News on Thursday that he’ll “hand that file” to the Treasury Department to process refunds if the court rules for the challengers.

“You’ll have all these importers and importing interests who are going to want that money back,” Greer said. “And so, we’ll have to figure out probably with the court what kind of a schedule might look like and what are the rights of these parties and what rights the government has to that money.”

Following the argument, businesses have already piled on new lawsuits in the Court of International Trade to ensure they’re in place.

“This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief,” Turn5, an auto parts e-commerce business, wrote in a lawsuit filed Thursday.

The government has confronted the problem before, after the Supreme Court in 1998 struck down a harbor maintenance tax as unconstitutional. It led to a new round of litigation that lasted roughly two years as companies fought for refunds.

But that battle involved only about $750 million, far less than the billions of dollars already collected under Trump’s new levies. Greer told Fox News the “reciprocal” tariffs are already more than $100 billion.

Trump has said a loss would turn the United States into a “third-world country” and casts the case as a life-or-death moment. He reiterated his concerns following the Supreme Court arguments, where justices appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments, when asked about his plans should the high court rule against the White House.

The president contended the government would have to pay back “trillions of dollars” because it’s taken in as much from the tariffs. A loss would also affect trade deals his administration made based on projected trade earnings, he said.

“I’m going to hope that we win,” Trump said Thursday. “I can’t imagine that anybody would do that kind of devastation to our country.”

Once resolved, the funds would go back into the companies’ coffers, because they were legally liable to front the costs. But Americans who paid inflated prices because of the tariffs would likely not see the money return to their pockets.

Seek out new tariff options

An adverse Supreme Court decision could bar Trump from invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement the bulk of his sweeping tariff agenda.

It would force the president to seek out other statutes to effectuate his overhaul of global trade.

“There is a whole host of statutes in the tariff architecture of Title 19, which both expressly confer the power to tariff and always impose clear limits,” Katyal said, referring to the section of law that deals with customs duties.

Katyal listed several options, including sections 122, 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Later in the argument, he referenced Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, as well.

Under Section 122 authority, Trump could impose tariffs up to 15 percent for up to 150 days over unbalanced trade, though it has not been used before.

The president could invoke Section 201 authority to impose duties if an increase in imports is causing or threatening “serious injury” to American manufacturers, after the U.S. International Trade Commission has investigated and made findings.

Using Section 232 authority, Trump could impose restrictions on imports if the U.S. secretary of Commerce determines, after an investigation, that some circumstance of those imports “threaten to impair” national security.

Trump could direct the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to impose tariffs as an enforcement measure of American rights under trade agreements and in response to certain foreign trade practices, following the office’s investigation, using Section 301 authority.

And by invoking Section 338 authority, the president could place tariffs on imports “whenever he shall find as a fact” that the foreign nations impose “unreasonable” charges or discriminate against U.S. commerce. Those levies may not exceed 50 percent. No president has used that measure, either.

“You can recreate some of what they want to do,” said John Yoo, a University of California, Berkeley professor and former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, at a panel during the Federalist Society’s annual conference.

Nazak Nikakhtar, partner and chair of the firm Wiley Rein’s national security practice, noted at the same event that every trade statute that allows the president to tariff “expressly says ‘duties’” and spells out a process.

“IEEPA looks very different, and I think based on textual [arguments], the president is likely to lose,” she said.

Justice Samuel Alito said during Wednesday’s argument that it’s a “realistic possibility” for the administration to try a new approach.

But Trump would then attempt to collect the tariffs under a new legal authority and, inevitably, the plaintiffs would take him back to court.

“And it would have to progress through those lower courts and come back to us when — a year from now? Six months from now? While the tariffs continue to be collected, and the amount that’s at stake mounts into the billions?” the conservative justice said.

“I mean, what are we at now, a hundred billion? We get up to — up to a trillion?” he continued. “That’s what you’re suggesting?”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/scotus_trump_tarrifs_110525gn05_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-10 17:02:04.219784

Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.
Despite Equatorial Guinea's oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty.
Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.""

Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country.

The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.

The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.

At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang, who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries.

The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang.

Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.

Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He's accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty.

Despite Equatorial Guinea's oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang's father, is Africa’s longest-serving president, holding power since 1979.

In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.

U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

I’m now trying to reopen my asylum case as part of new proceedings.
At the moment, I’m awaiting two rulings: one on my release from immigration detention, and another on my asylum case.
The biggest wave of Russians seeking political asylum in the U.S. came in 2022–2023, during the Biden administration.","In the 10 months since Donald Trump returned to the presidency, U.S. federal immigration agents have begun carrying out frequent raids of American cities in search of people to deport. Twice over the summer, large groups of Russian nationals were expelled from the country, and at least two of them were arrested immediately after returning to Russia. As of late August, about 200,000 people had been deported from the U.S. during Trump’s second term. Meduza spoke with three Russians who applied for asylum in the U.S. because they feared persecution at home, but whose applications were denied. They’re now living as undocumented immigrants, knowing they could be deported at any time.

Asylum application rejected after 11 years of waiting

In 2014, when [Ella] Pamfilova took over as Russia’s human rights commissioner, I was fired from that agency’s press service. Until then, all attempts by the security services to go after me for my [pro-democracy] activism had been fended off by [Vladimir] Lukin, who had been my boss for 10 years. Before my dismissal, the new head of HR put together a file of compromising material on me — including all the police reports from my detentions at protests and the corresponding court rulings. He told me he would hand everything over to his colleagues at the Federal Security Service (FSB), where he himself had worked until recently, to “check for extremism.” That could have landed me in prison for up to five years. So I decided to leave quickly.

I believed that America was the one country that could guarantee my safety. I had no dream of buying a villa or a yacht — I just wanted to save my life. My English wasn’t great, I had never been to the U.S., and I didn’t have any family there. Still, I took the risk: I came on a tourist visa and later applied for political asylum.

Back in 2014, I had to start my life from scratch. In Russia, I held a PhD in history and worked in an office. Here, I worked at a gas station, as a waiter, and as a cab driver. Now I’m a long-haul trucker — the best-paying of all the jobs I’ve had, and one of the few open to me. But I’m about to lose even that: under a new regulation, only U.S. citizens or green card holders are allowed to drive large trucks. At the same time, I need money to pay a lawyer — around $20,000. Considering I also have to cover rent, the situation is tough.

By law, the period between applying for asylum and being called in for an interview with an immigration officer is supposed to be 45 days at most. But I had to wait 11 years. The authorities say these kinds of delays are due to a personnel shortage, but I suspect the real reason is that they’re waiting for applicants to give up and move elsewhere — or for the regimes they fled to change, so that their asylum claims no longer have grounds.

In early October 2025, my asylum claim was denied. I got the sense that the officer interviewing me had already decided to reject my case before we even spoke. He was extremely biased during the interview, and he refused to consider a report detailing the current situation in Russia, an expert statement about my case, and other evidence. He asked a lot of irrelevant questions but never the most important one: why I left Russia.

I told him about my dismissal and the threats of criminal prosecution only in my closing statement — the only opportunity I had after the interview. The officer also ignored the fact that because of my posts on Facebook and VKontakte, Roskomnadzor had repeatedly sent me letters accusing me of “discrediting” the Russian army and spreading “fake news” about it, promoting terrorism and extremism, destabilizing the public order, and personally “discrediting” Comrade Putin.

I watched justice die right before my eyes. All the immigration officers and judges [who handle asylum cases] are just bureaucrats forced to follow orders from above. In closed Facebook groups for immigrants, people often share reports about judges being fired for approving more than half of asylum applications. They’re replaced by more “disciplined” military lawyers who are instructed to follow directives and deny people residency.

I came to the U.S. before Donald Trump became president. Under [Barack] Obama and [Joe] Biden, there were no plans to deport a million migrants a year. It’s immigrants who make America great — and now the country is undermining the foundation of its own economy.

The situation has gotten even worse now, because ICE has begun patrolling highways and specifically targeting truckers. If I get caught in one of these raids, I’ll be sent to detention, which would make working with my lawyer much harder. They’ll take away my phone, and I won’t be able to make calls without special permission. And prison guards treat detainees far worse than the police do. In practice, if I’m stopped on the road, deportation will be inevitable.

After I went public about my situation this fall, human rights organizations from Poland and France reached out to me. They’re now reviewing my application for a humanitarian visa.

Many [immigrants in situations like mine] prefer to stay silent, hoping for a favorable court decision. I’ve chosen to speak out — to warn anyone planning to leave Russia to think very carefully before seeking asylum in America under the current administration.

Vladislav Krasnov

Spent more than a year and a half in detention before having his asylum application denied in spring 2025

In Russia, I volunteered with [late opposition leader Alexey Navalny’s] Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and was one of the organizers of the “indefinite protest” [against pension reform in 2018]. For obvious reasons, my family and I didn’t want to have anything to do with the war in Ukraine — not even indirectly, by paying taxes. So we decided to leave the country. Besides, my colleague Dima Ivanov had just been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison, and I didn’t want to share his fate. I decided to move to the U.S. — I believed asylum cases there were reviewed impartially and that officials actually looked at the evidence.

At first, I tried to apply for a student visa — my plan was to improve my English and get a degree. But my application was rejected. I felt unsafe in the country where I was staying at the time, so I decided to try reaching the U.S. through Mexico. I went alone; my family stayed behind. I downloaded the CBP One app in advance — it had been introduced by the Biden administration to help asylum seekers avoid crossing the border illegally. Through the app, I notified U.S. border officials of my intention to apply for asylum, and I was assigned a specific time to cross.

As far as I know, everyone who crossed that way was processed properly: they submitted fingerprints, filled out the necessary paperwork, and awaited their asylum hearings while free. But by August 2023, when I reached the border, Biden had apparently issued informal instructions for some migrants to be detained for “extra screening.”

After I crossed the U.S. border I was sent to a holding cell — a 20-square-meter room packed with 25 people. We slept on yoga mats and covered ourselves with foil blankets. A week later, I was inexplicably transferred to Mississippi — a different state, meaning a different jurisdiction. I had been headed to California, where I had a sponsor and friends, and where asylum cases are approved much more often than in Republican-run Mississippi or Louisiana. In those states, the statistics are grim: judges approve barely two percent of asylum claims.

I went through my interview, but I wasn’t released from detention. Officers were letting maybe one person out of every 50 go free, even though our cases and evidence were practically identical. I ended up stuck in detention for three weeks, in a barracks with 75 beds for 150 people. The routine was absurd: breakfast at 4:00 a.m., lunch at 10:00, dinner at 4:00 p.m. Communication was another problem — some people couldn’t reach their families for weeks. It was, in a word, absurd.

I spent more than six months in detention. After my interview, I was scheduled for a court hearing in Los Angeles in 2024 — but a few days later I received a letter saying my case had been transferred to Louisiana. It’s a Republican state, and some lawyers call it a “deportation hub.”

On March 1 — the day of Navalny’s funeral — I was brought before the court. I presented evidence showing I faced persecution in Russia: court records, letters from [human rights activist] Lev Ponomaryov, TV Rain, and [human rights organization] OVD-Info confirming that I had volunteered with FBK, that they knew me personally, and that I was in real danger. But it wasn’t enough. Instead of discussing my case, the judge fixated on the fact that I had been an election observer, and we spent an hour talking about the Russian electoral system.

My lawyer made several mistakes that affected the outcome — for example, he failed to submit my full persecution history. As a result, the case materials contained inconsistencies.

Later, I obtained additional evidence: a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights confirming that my detentions in Russia had been unlawful; interviews I’d given to media outlets like The Guardian; and new letters of support from Memorial, [Russian opposition politician Ilya] Yashin, and many other public figures.

After the hearing, I filed an appeal — and while it was pending, I learned that my lawyer had lost his license. In July, I found a new attorney, but in August I was put in cuffs — on both my hands and feet, like in a movie — and transferred from Louisiana to New Jersey for deportation.

At the airport, I managed to talk to the officers out of putting me on the plane. I gave them my appeal number and insisted they take me back to detention. I’ve heard that in cases like this, people are sometimes literally shoved onto planes, kicked inside, and sent to Russia via Dubai, Cairo, Istanbul, or Qatar.

When I was brought back to Louisiana, I was released from detention under a pre-trial agreement, thanks to the fact that I had joined a lawsuit against former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In late October, after 14.5 months in custody, I finally left Louisiana and went to California, where a friend who had agreed to sponsor me took me in.

I’m now trying to reopen my asylum case as part of new proceedings. Appeals don’t take new evidence into account — which is why I had to rely on the limited documents my first lawyer filed. Now I’m determined to see this case through.

At the same time, I can’t leave the U.S. After my release, I had no documents — they were taken when I crossed the border. I don’t know where they are now, and after so many transfers, I doubt they’ve survived.

These days, I’ve found a kind of calm — a “zen” about it all. It was hard at first, especially being away from my family, and particularly in detention. I was there when detainees were still given 500 free phone minutes, but that program ended in June 2024, and now every call costs money.

A lot of people break down in immigration detention. There are no clear timelines for legalization, and in Republican states, under Trump’s current policies, getting asylum is practically impossible. In the end, many simply give up and ask to be sent back.

Spent more than two years in migration detention and has appealed his deportation ruling

Russia’s armed attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, was a shock unlike anything I had ever experienced. Comparable only to losing someone close to you. Over the next couple of months, as reports of war crimes mounted and most Russians remained indifferent, it became clear to me that I couldn’t go on living in that kind of environment.

I staged a one-man protest in my city and was given a jail sentence for it. Afterward, security officers came to warn me — along with my 83-year-old, seriously ill mother — that if I didn’t stop, I would end up in prison. My mother was in tears, begging me not to go out again.

But I wanted to protest constantly — almost every time I read the news from Ukraine. I promised my mother I would stop and started preparing to leave the country. I wrapped up work projects, sold some property, and began the process of getting my passport for foreign travel.

After the announcement of Russia’s “partial mobilization,” I bought a ticket to Yerevan. During my first months abroad, I realized I needed to move on — Armenia wasn’t my culture, even though it’s a democratic country and generally friendly to Russians.

I hadn’t planned to seek asylum anywhere. I considered applying for a German work visa, but at 45, I was told by an integration center that health insurance becomes significantly more expensive at that age and that employers rarely hire “older” applicants.

Europe also felt closer to me than the U.S., but by 2023, I couldn’t find a way to get there from Armenia. Meanwhile, several of my acquaintances had gone to the United States. After crossing the border from Mexico, they received local driver’s licenses, work permits and waited for their asylum hearings while living freely.

One of them advised me to do the same. He didn’t regret his choice — and still doesn’t — and I respected him enough to follow his example. It never occurred to me that I might end up in immigration detention. There was the CBP One app, which seemed like a perfectly legal way to enter the U.S. All the online reviews I found were positive: people waited for their assigned date, crossed the border, received a “Form I-94,” and lived legally in the U.S. while awaiting their court date. There was no mention of arrests or detention.

I flew to Mexico City in July 2023 and registered in the CBP One app the same day. At the end of August, I was told to appear at a specific location and time for an appointment with a border officer at the San Ysidro Pedestrian Crossing.

My asylum request was denied in May 2024 — because I had traveled back to Russia few times from Armenia to wrap up personal affairs. The judge decided my encounters with the police didn’t amount to persecution. I was dissatisfied with the ruling and felt I hadn’t been given a full chance to present my arguments in court.

I appealed to a higher authority, but the appeal was rejected, fully upholding the immigration judge’s decision. At first, I resigned myself to it and began preparing for deportation. (Immigration authorities had ruled to send me to Russia, even though I asked to be deported to Armenia.) But when I reread the decision, I realized how superficial it was — it failed to address key arguments I had raised on appeal, such as my involvement in Navalny-linked organizations and my financial support for them. On top of that, I could face prosecution in Russia for donations I made from Armenia to Ukrainian charities.

So without much hope, I filed a second appeal while continuing to prepare for deportation. To my surprise, the federal appellate court was sympathetic: it appointed a pro bono lawyer for me and issued an order halting my deportation. Now I’m waiting for the final decision, which could come any day.

In addition, in June I filed a motion in a federal district court in Pennsylvania, arguing that my detention had dragged on too long. During the hearing, the federal judge sided with me and criticized ICE for keeping me locked up without sufficient justification.

At the moment, I’m awaiting two rulings: one on my release from immigration detention, and another on my asylum case. If deportation does happen, I’ll try to escape during a flight transfer — to avoid being sent back to Russia. I know of cases where deportees managed to pull that off. Much will depend on the country the layover is in — and, of course, on luck. So far, I haven’t had much of that.

A human rights advocate’s take

Anna Shumova, chair of the board of directors of Russian Seattle for Freedom, which helps Russian immigrants in the U.S.

The biggest wave of Russians seeking political asylum in the U.S. came in 2022–2023, during the Biden administration. For those crossing the U.S.–Mexico border through the CBP One app, wait times varied widely: at first, it might take just a couple of weeks, but by 2023–2024, people were waiting up to ten months.

Things started to change in June 2024, when a memo directed immigration officials to keep all Russian nationals in detention until their court hearings. It’s hard to say how fairly U.S. immigration courts evaluate cases from other countries — I only work with Russians — but it seems clear the current crackdown affects asylum seekers across the board.

With Trump’s return to the White House, one major thing shifted: deportations became large-scale and routine. Multiple flights to Russia now leave each month. Many immigration judges have been dismissed, and the rest, in my view, are trying to adapt to the new reality to keep their jobs.

Another telling sign came in August, when the Trump administration released the State Department’s annual report on human rights in Russia. This year’s edition was almost three times shorter than the previous one — 41 pages instead of 110. The section on LGBTQ+ rights was cut entirely, and political repression was described as something that affects only prominent journalists, activists, and public figures — not ordinary citizens.

For Russians whose asylum requests and appeals have been denied, finding another way to legalize their status in the U.S. is extremely difficult. Marriage to an American citizen is technically an option, but in practice, most people try to reopen their cases instead. After that first hearing, asylum seekers usually understand what the court was looking for and where their case was weak. If they get another chance, they do everything they can to strengthen their evidence and collect more testimony.

The reality in detention centers doesn’t vary much between conservative and liberal states. ICE — the federal agency that runs all of them — sets the tone nationwide. And the U.S. prison system has never been known for its compassion. The problems are the same everywhere: no medical care, constant psychological pressure, no sense of what’s ahead, limited access to lawyers or family, no documents, computers, or phones, bad food, and filthy conditions.

Once the U.S. denies your asylum claim, getting protection elsewhere is nearly impossible. That’s why Russians have to explore any possible route — work or student visas, or residency through investment programs. The only relatively safe way to leave the U.S. after losing a case is if you weren’t in detention at the time of the decision. Otherwise, deportation to Russia is almost guaranteed.

In terms of anxiety levels, life for Russians waiting for a decision from the immigration court feels a lot like life in Russia. You’re constantly expecting that you might be thrown in jail, and you never know where you’ll run into law enforcement. On top of that, you don’t have a work permit or any rights.",https://meduza.io/imgly/share/1762798330/en/feature/2025/11/10/thousands-of-russians-have-applied-for-asylum-in-the-u-s-since-2022-trump-s-ice-raids-could-land-many-of-them-in-putin-s-prisons,N,,2025-11-10 17:57:04.570830

While the U.S. Department of Homeland security is once again justifying their actions, the question becomes whether the judge overseeing the preliminary injunction will agree as even her orders are now being appealed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Cellphone video showed the moment Saturday morning Rafael Veraza says he and his family were pepper sprayed by Border Patrol agents in the parking lot of a Sam's Club in Cicero, just over the city border from Chicago's Little Village neighborhood.

""He started spraying from the front of the car towards the back. Basically I got sprayed all over my face,"" Veraza said.

He says the effect was immediate.

""I'm asthmatic. I've been with asthma since I was a little kid,"" Veraza said. ""So the moment that it hit me, I couldn't breathe.""

He said his 1-year-old daughter Arianna, who was riding in the back of the car, also breathed in the gas. Both were briefly hospitalized.

""My daughter was trying to open her eyes,"" Veraza said. ""She was struggling to breathe.""

Homeland Security says Border Patrol agents had entered the Sam's parking lot shortly after deploying crowd control measures on the residents of Little Village. It happened in the aftermath of what they said were gunshots fired from a black Jeep Wrangler aimed directly at them.

""Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol's vehicle,"" a DHS statement read in part. ""After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window.""

Images showing the damage were also released by DHS. However, there was no explanation as to why Veraza and his family, who had decided to abort their shopping trip after seeing the agents' presence, were pepper sprayed.

""I'm not even doing a thing,"" Veraza. ""I'm trying to exit.""

On Sunday, surrounded by elected officials and other community members, Veraza came forward with his story. He and others expressing outrage at the way in which they say agents lashed out at the entire community in the aftermath of shots allegedly being fired. With tear gas and other chemical agents that were deployed at those that had come out to protest the agents presence in Little Village.

""There were ten cars in front of me. There were neighbors all around. People were upset. All of the agents popped out of the car, guns drawn. Did not hear a single warning,"" said Pastor Matt DeMateo with New Life Community Church. ""I thought my van was going to get hit from behind... I turned to my left. Hadn't noticed he was there. There was Bovino with the grenade. Pulls the pin. Holds it, carries it, has an interaction with neighbors and then hops into his van.""

Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García called out what he calls the federal government's ""campaign of terror"" against Chicago, but also imploring for peace to prevail even while encouraging people to continue documenting what they see.

""I recognize the anger. I recognize how so many people feel. however if we succumb to violence we will lose our battle,"" Rep. García said. ""If we succumb to violence our message will get lost.""

Forced migration is at the root of the modern migration crisis.
While it does not cancel the right to migrate—long upheld by Catholic social teaching—it calls attention to a prior moral obligation: to create the conditions where migration is not a necessity born of hardship, but a free and dignified choice.","For our Sounding Board column, U.S. Catholic asks authors to argue one side of a many-sided issue of importance to Catholics around the country. We also invite readers to submit their responses to these opinion essays—whether agreement or disagreement—in the survey that follows. A selection of the survey results appear below, as well as in the October 2025 issue of U.S. Catholic. You can participate in our current survey here.

As Pope Leo XIV begins his pontificate, many people expect him to continue Pope Francis’ focus on migrants’ rights, a cause he has already promoted in several public statements. In fact, even his choice of name—Leo—appears to signal a deeper commitment to this issue. His namesake, Pope Leo XIII, was the first pope to promote part of migrants’ rights that is often over-looked: the right not to migrate.

In the midst of massive deportations and growing attention to border crises in the United States, the church’s teaching not only affirms people’s right to migrate but also emphasizes the freedom people have to remain in their homeland. This “right to stay” refers to individual’s and families’ right to live securely and with dignity in their homelands, rather than being driven to leave by violence, poverty, or political instability. It places a moral obligation on the international community and local governments to address the root causes that force migration in the first place.

The migration crisis is not only a political or economic issue—it is a moral challenge that tests our commitment to human dignity and the common good. Catholic social teaching insists that true justice in migration policy must uphold both the right to migrate and the right to remain in one’s homeland. This means confronting the injustices—such as war, poverty, environmental degradation, and political oppression—that compel people to relocate in search for a better life.

A just response requires more than managing borders. It demands international solidarity, development policies that respect human dignity and foster the common good, and a renewed commitment to building conditions in which people are truly free to stay and flourish.

The idea of the “right to stay” first appeared in Pope Leo XIII’s 1888 encyclical Quam Aerumnosa (On Italian Immigrants), which addressed the challenges faced by Italian migrants to the United States. The pope expressed sorrow that many people had left Italy in search of a better life only to face poverty and harsh conditions in their new home. Worse still, many people lost access to the sacraments and the life of the church. In response, Leo sent missionary priests to minister to migrants in their own language—an early example of papal advocacy for migrants’ spiritual and material support.

Three years later, in Rerum Novarum (On Capital and Labor), Leo took this advocacy a step further, addressing the material struggle of migrants. He argued that governments and civil society should help workers build enough stability and property in their home countries to support their families. In other words, people should not have to migrate simply to survive—they should be able to flourish where they are.

These two insights form the core of what we now call the right not to migrate. First, people should not be compelled to leave their homelands due to unmet material needs or fear of violence and persecution. And second, societies should actively promote the conditions that allow people to remain—conditions like peace, security, and economic opportunity. In other words, migration should be a free choice, not a desperate necessity.

This idea has deep roots in the Catholic tradition. In 567, the Second Council of Tours called on local communities to care for the poor in the area so people would not be forced to travel to foreign cities in search of help. The council states:

Each and every city should provide its poor and needy inhabitants with sufficient nourishment in accordance with its own ability. Both priests and citizens should take care of feeding the poor in their own region. In this manner, the poor will not have to engage in tiresome traveling and dwell in foreign cities.

According to the Council, public officials and members of society ought to support the poor so that they are not constrained to move away to foreign lands.

A 16th-century Dominican theologian, Domingo de Soto, professor at the University of Salamanca and one of the main voices at the Council of Trent, mentions the right to stay when talking about foreign beggars in his book Deliberation on the Cause of the Poor. This book was written in response to laws in Europe that forbade public begging, especially of foreign beggars.

Soto defended people’s right to migrate to other countries based on natural law, hospitality, and the universal destination of goods. Some people objected to his argument, saying that the Second Council of Tours dismissed the right to migrate by promoting a right to stay. Soto, however, replied that the right to stay, as expressed in the Council, did not impede the right to migrate to other countries. Instead, people still have the right to migrate when they deem it necessary, and it is essential to support the poor so they are not compelled to leave their homeland if it can be avoided.

Modern popes have continued teaching the right to stay. In Exsul Familia (On the Spiritual Care of Immigrants), inspired by Leo XIII, Pius XII argues that the principle of the universal destination of goods ensures that people have a right for a living space, a place to develop themselves and their families, especially in their own homelands.

The universal destination of goods is an ancient Christian principle rooted in the theology of creation. God created the universe for the good of all people, and no one should be kept from the basic goods they need for their flourishing on account of nationality, wealth, race, or belief. While the church respects and defends private property and national sovereignty as pillars of society, these are not absolute principles and should not override people’s basic rights to survive and thrive.

After the horrors of World War II and the experiences of totalitarian regimes, John XXIII grounded the right to stay in the dignity of the human person in the encyclical Pacem in Terris (On Peace), affirming everyone’s right to live and move freely within their own country—and to return if they leave.

The dignity of the human person is a key principle of Catholic social teaching. Every individual is created in the image and likeness of God and redeemed by Christ, and therefore must be protected and cared for, regardless of nationality, religion, or ethnicity. St. Pope John Paul II continued to emphasized this right, referring to the “right not to migrate” in his 2004 message for the World Day of Migrants and Refugees. He talked about the dysfunctional migration of our times as the “migration of the desperate” and urged governments and society as a whole to take an active role in eliminating the root causes of forced migration.

Given the long history of Catholic teaching on the right to stay, Catholics should be aware that besides the right to migrate, the church teaches that people should have the freedom to choose to stay in their homeland. Forced migration is at the root of the modern migration crisis.

Catholic social teaching maintains that a local society and the international community should work to build the common good by promoting peace, rule of law, justice, and security while ensuring access to health care, education, housing, decent work, political stability, and human rights so people are not compelled to leave their homes.

In communities where the common good is in decline, people often feel compelled to leave their homeland and migrate abroad in pursuit of conditions more conducive to human flourishing. In a simple way, Catholics should work for justice and solidarity internationally, especially with those that live in vulnerable communities.

This right does not imply that migration should be obstructed. On the contrary, every pope since Pius XII has strongly affirmed the right to migrate while acknowledging the need for legitimate regulation of migration. However, the freedom to remain in one’s homeland calls for efforts to address the root causes of forced and dysfunctional migration, ensuring that people are free to stay where they are, even as migration remains a legitimate and protected option.

As Pope Francis reminded the church in one of his final messages for the World Day of Migrants, the right not to migrate safeguards the freedom to choose whether to stay or leave and calls for the responsibility of governments and civil societies. This is designed specially against forced and dysfunctional migration. While it does not cancel the right to migrate—long upheld by Catholic social teaching—it calls attention to a prior moral obligation: to create the conditions where migration is not a necessity born of hardship, but a free and dignified choice.

Thune said that, per the deal under consideration, the Senate would agree to hold a separate vote later on the subsidies.
“The Senate might get a vote” on the health insurance credits, Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico Democrat, said.
Two leading progressives in the Senate Democratic caucus were even more dismissive of the emerging compromise.
“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.","The US Senate on Sunday took a key vote on a bill that would end the record-setting federal government shutdown without extending the healthcare subsidies that Democrats have demanded.

Senators began voting on Sunday night to advance House-passed stopgap funding legislation that the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said would be amended to combine another short-term spending measure with a package of three full-year appropriations bills.

The package would still have to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to Donald Trump for his signature, a process that could take several days.

Senate Democrats so far have resisted efforts to reopen the government, aiming to pressure Republicans into agreeing to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, which expire at the end of the year. Thune said that, per the deal under consideration, the Senate would agree to hold a separate vote later on the subsidies.

Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator for Connecticut, told reporters that he would vote against the funding measure but suggested there could be enough Democratic support to pass it.

“I am unwilling to accept a vague promise of a vote at some indeterminate time, on some undefined measure that extends the healthcare tax credits,” Blumenthal said.

“The Senate might get a vote” on the health insurance credits, Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico Democrat, said. “I’ll emphasize ‘might’. But is Speaker Johnson gonna do anything? Is the president gonna do anything?”

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has previously said he would not hold a vote on a plan to extend the tax credits that make health insurance affordable for millions of Americans who are not insured through their employers.

Two leading progressives in the Senate Democratic caucus were even more dismissive of the emerging compromise. “It’s a mistake,” Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Punchbowl News. “It would be a policy and political disaster for Democrats to cave,” Bernie Sanders of Vermont said.

Democrats in the House expressed their dismay. Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, promised to fight the proposed legislation. “We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives,” Jeffries said in a statement.

“A deal that doesn’t reduce health care costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them”, Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who leads the House progressive caucus, wrote on X. “Republicans want health care cuts. Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn’t a compromise – it’s capitulation. Millions of families would pay the price.”

“Unacceptable,” the Florida congressman Maxwell Frost chimed in. “There are 189,000 people in my district who will be paying 50-300% more for the same, and in many cases worse, healthcare. I won’t do that to the people I represent. I’m a NO on this ‘deal’.”

Democrats outside Washington denounced the compromise as well. “Pathetic. This isn’t a deal. It’s a surrender. Don’t bend the knee!” California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, wrote on social media.

Sunday marked the 40th day of the shutdown, which has sidelined federal workers and affected food aid, parks and travel, while air traffic control staffing shortages threaten to derail travel during the busy Thanksgiving holiday season late this month. Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina, said the mounting effects of the shutdown have pushed the chamber toward an agreement. He said the final piece, a new resolution that would fund government operations into late January, would also reverse at least some of the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of federal workers.

“Temperatures cool, the atmospheric pressure increases outside and all of a sudden it looks like things will come together,” Tillis told reporters. Should the government remain closed for much longer, economic growth could turn negative in the fourth quarter, especially if air travel does not return to normal levels by Thanksgiving, the White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett warned on the CBS Face the Nation show. Thanksgiving falls on 27 November this year.

Americans shopping for 2026 Obamacare health insurance plans are facing a more than doubling of monthly premiums on average, health experts estimate, with the pandemic-era subsidies due to expire at the end of the year. Republicans rejected a proposal on Friday by the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, to vote to reopen the government in exchange for a one-year extension of tax credits that lower costs for plans under the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.

Adam Schiff, a Democratic California senator, said on Sunday he believed Trump’s healthcare proposal was aimed at gutting the ACA and allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.

“So the same insurance companies he’s railing against in those tweets, he is saying: ‘I’m going to give you more power to cancel people’s policies and not cover them if they have a pre-existing condition,’” Schiff said on ABC’s This Week program.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4fb516e98952f4688c2cd23cb9bb52f6674c0f/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0e07f7d63ed6007f4fd2124849b6760",N,,2025-11-10 18:57:11.079632

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens.
Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.
Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty.
Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”

Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country.

The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.

The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.

At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang, who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries.

The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang.

Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.

Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He’s accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty.

Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang’s father, is Africa’s longest-serving president, holding power since 1979.

In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.

U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

The workshop, entitled ‘Litigation before the European Court of Human Rights: Immigration detention and alternatives to the detention of children,’ brought together lawyers, human rights advocates, and civil society actors from across Europe.

Organised within the framework of the RELEASE Project, the event provided an important collaborative learning space. Its goal was to strengthen our collective understanding of the procedural and strategic dimensions of litigating cases involving the rights of children in, and alternatives to, immigration detention before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

Through case studies and expert-led discussions, we explored the challenges of representing migrant children in detention contexts, the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, and innovative litigation and advocacy strategies to protect their rights.

Understanding Litigation Before the ECtHR

We began by examining the procedural steps required to bring a case before the ECtHR – from admissibility requirements and communication with the Court’s Registry, to navigating the different stages of proceedings. Understanding these mechanisms is fundamental, not just for lawyers, but for all those involved in safeguarding children’s rights across borders.

Discussions then moved toward substantive rights: the protection of migrant children under the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly in relation to Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) and Article 5 (right to liberty and security). We also analysed the use of interim measures, urgent procedural tools available to prevent irreparable harm to children facing imminent risk of detention or deportation.

These sessions were both technical and human. They reminded us that behind every application to the Court are children; individuals whose experiences of fear, uncertainty, and confinement demand urgent legal and moral attention.

The EU Pact on Migration and Asylum: Between Progress and Peril

One of the most critical and timely discussions during the workshop concerned the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum. While the Pact introduces certain safeguards for children’s rights, it also raises serious human rights concerns.

By embedding detention into border and screening procedures, the Pact risks normalising the detention of children – a practice that international law and child rights bodies have repeatedly declared to be never in a child’s best interests.

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and numerous child rights organisations have rightly called for a complete ban on the immigration detention of children, urging Member States to enshrine such prohibitions in national legislation.

At the heart of this issue lies a fundamental question: Do we treat children in migration as rights-holders, or as instruments of migration control?

Implementation will be the true test. States must ensure that all safeguards under international human rights law are not only codified but applied in practice. The best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in every decision. Detention cannot be justified on grounds of migration management.

Instead, States should invest in community-based alternatives – models that prioritise care, protection, and dignity. True alternatives to detention are not merely procedural mechanisms; they are reflections of a society’s values.

Sharing the Maltese Context

What struck me most deeply during the workshop was the reaction of other participants when we shared the Maltese context. Many were visibly shocked to learn how, in Malta, migrant children are too often treated as migrants first and children second.

It was difficult to describe how some minors, despite being visibly underage, are handcuffed during transfers; or how access to education is sometimes denied, leading to severe consequences for their mental health and development.

These are not isolated instances. They reflect systemic failures to uphold the most basic standards of child protection.

International monitoring bodies have raised these concerns time and again. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture(CPT), in several reports, has found that facilities such as Safi Detention Centre are unsuitable for children. The CPT has repeatedly urged the Maltese authorities to establish alternative accommodation and ensure that children are never detained in such conditions.

Yet, progress remains painfully slow.

Law, Accountability, and the Role of Litigation

One of the workshop’s central aims was to examine how the law itself permits the immigration detention of children and how it can be challenged.

Participants discussed the different legal avenues available to contest such practices:

arguing that detention breaches constitutional protections;

demonstrating violations of EU law;

invoking breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights (particularly Articles 3 and 5);

highlighting non-compliance with the European Social Charter; and

asserting violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which explicitly requires that the detention of children be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.

However, legal frameworks alone are not enough. We must ask the difficult, uncomfortable questions:

Are breaches of children’s right to liberty isolated or systemic?

What alternatives to detention exist in practice?

Are these alternatives being considered, and if so, why are they being rejected?

Accountability demands that these questions not remain rhetorical.

The CPT’s Findings: Persistent Concerns

In its recent report, published just a few months ago, the CPT expressed continued concern about the conditions in Malta’s immigration detention facilities. The Committee noted that detained children “had no access to regular purposeful activities, education or even the exercise yard for more than one to two hours per day.”

The report reaffirmed the CPT’s longstanding position: “Every effort should be made to avoid resorting to the deprivation of liberty of a foreign national who is a child.”

This is not a recommendation; it is a reminder of our legal and moral obligation.

Leaving Athens, I felt a mix of emotions.

Disheartened, because the stories shared across Europe revealed a persistent pattern: migrant children being detained, separated, and dehumanised in the name of border control.

Determined, because despite these realities, there is a growing movement of lawyers, advocates, and organisations pushing for change – challenging policies, litigating cases, and giving voice to those who are too often silenced.

Every policy decision, every piece of legislation, and every court ruling affects real children. Behind the legal arguments are faces, names, and futures.

At aditus foundation, we remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting and promoting the rights and dignity of migrant children in Malta and beyond.

Through legal support, we assist children and families in navigating complex procedures, challenging unlawful detention, and ensuring access to essential services such as education and healthcare.

Looking Ahead

Workshops like these are invaluable reminders that while progress can be slow, it is possible. Each shared strategy, each successful case, and each act of solidarity brings us closer to a future where no child is ever deprived of liberty simply for seeking safety.

Our collective challenge is to ensure that Europe lives up to its ideals of human rights, justice, and dignity for all.

They visited an ICE facility to verify conditions and interview a detainee while maintaining anonymity for safety and journalistic integrity.

According to a Facebook post by Victor Galvan on March 20th, political prisoner and long-time Colorado community member Jeanette Vizguerra told friends and family that she was receiving two pieces of bread, some jam and an apple per day at the Geo ICE Detention Center in Aurora, Colorado. As ICE activity has exponentially increased locally and nationally, this claim raised critical concerns about the physical well-being of detainees, among a litany of concerns about human rights violations.

Journalists are not permitted in the Geo ICE Center, so with the help of community organizers, I was able to visit with a detainee as a “friend” and further investigate claims. For their safety, the interviewee’s name will be omitted.

Visiting a detainee requires navigating strict scheduling and security protocols. Visitors must bring the detainee’s “A-number,” valid ID, and adhere to strict dress codes.

After around three hours of delays, intensive security screening, and sitting in a lobby with an American-flag-backdropped picture of Trump looming over it, visitors were ushered into a prison-like visitation booth, complete with white-cast cement walls, fluorescent lights, and shoddy phones to communicate through. My subject is an immigrant who told me they had been detained for over a year at the Aurora ICE Center. Despite willingly submitting themself to detention and deportation, the latter process had been continually delayed, subjecting them to further mistreatment in detention.

In 2012, my interviewee was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease, a set of persistent symptoms following Lyme infection. Its clinical recognition remains debated, similar to “Long COVID” following coronavirus infection. According to accredited medical resource LymeDisease.org, “An LDo published survey of over 3,000 patients with chronic Lyme disease found that patients suffer a worse quality of life than most other chronic illnesses, including congestive heart failure, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and arthritis. Over 70% of patients with chronic Lyme disease reported fair or poor health.” The interviewee had been able to manage their symptoms to much success before imprisonment, but lack of proper care in the facility allowed the disease to progress to a debilitating degree.

Considering that proper nutrition is central to treating Lyme Disease Persistent Symptoms (LDPS), my interviewee had a keen investment in the claims I was investigating. Since the visitation with Jeanette Vizguerra in March, ostensibly, the meals have improved for the wider detainee population in the GEO ICE Center. It was reported that three meals a day are served, typically consisting of a silver-dollar-sized portion of salad, small portions of beans (or other protein), rice, potato, cornbread, and fruit. Multiple doctors in the past advised that this detainee cut out gluten and sugar from their diet, so they are generally restricted to salad, beans, and rice.

“It isn’t enough food to ever feel full from,” they told me. “I will often eat the food they give me, even if I’m not supposed to for my health, just because I’m so hungry.” Whether all detainees, including political prisoners or those under punishment, receive similar meals is unclear.

Another troubling aspect of the detainee’s treatment is the handling of their medication. Correct timing and dosing are crucial for treating. “It’s important that my medications are spread out over the day, especially around meals,” the interviewee told me. “But staff usually give me all the medications at once to save time, which makes me sick.”

Since imprisonment, the subject’s overall health has taken a sharp decline. They report a chronic fatigue, which makes any physical activity next to impossible; trouble focusing, so extreme it prevents them from reading (one of their favorite activities and one of few activities afforded to detainees), and other impairing psychological problems, including schizoaffective symptoms.

My interviewee’s experience at the Aurora Geo ICE Center illustrates the severe consequences of inadequate care, consequences that are being felt by the tens of thousands of detainees reported across the United States. The need for oversight and accountability for detainees, particularly those with chronic and medically complex conditions, is incredibly urgent. If GEO and ICE continue to operate with little transparency and no meaningful accountability, it is likely that Aurora and the nation will continue to see worsening reports of abuse, neglect, and death in these facilities. Organizations such as CO Stands Together and many others are advocating for such transparency and accountability from Geo and Colorado leaders. Such organizations are also providing a wealth of opportunities for Colorado residents to stay informed and get involved, such as attending the weekly vigil in honor of Jeanette Vizguerra held at the Aurora ICE center, supporting detainees with donations for commissary, and much more.",https://yellowscene.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Handcuffs-Prison-Image-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 17:01:50.234888

Ahead of a hearing in that case, scheduled for later Monday, many state officials sharply rebuked the Trump administration for continuing the fight.
But the Trump administration refused to back down, turning first to an appeals court, which denied its first request, before escalating the fight to the Supreme Court.
There, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay, to buy the appeals court more time to review the matter.
“For low-income Americans, SNAP is a vital bulwark against hunger and food insecurity,” the appellate court said.","The Trump administration on Monday said that it would return to the Supreme Court in yet another attempt to halt full federal funding for food stamps, signifying the latest twist in a winding saga that has imperiled the nation’s largest anti-hunger program.

The administration revealed its intentions just hours after an appeals court refused to block the decision of a lower court judge, who had previously ordered the government to finance benefits completely this month for the roughly 42 million people who receive aid to buy groceries.

The move came as Congress inched closer to reopening the government, offering a glimmer of hope that lawmakers might finally put an end to the wrangling over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The program has faced extensive disruption and delay in recent weeks as a result of President Trump’s refusal to fully finance the program.

If the government reopens, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said the administration’s emergency request to the Supreme Court would not be needed. Otherwise, he said, the government “still intends to pursue a stay” to halt the order requiring full SNAP payments.

For all of the persistent legal uncertainty, the developments on Monday offered a pathway to resolving the weekslong battle waged by cities, states, religious groups and nonprofits, which have been trying to spare low-income Americans from severe financial hardship while much of Washington remains largely inoperative.

Despite having ample funds in reserve, the Trump administration has refused to supply the money required to help roughly one in eight Americans purchase groceries. Its position has offered a stark contrast with the other ways that Mr. Trump has rearranged the budget during the shutdown, including his work to reprogram billions of dollars to pay the officers conducting mass deportations.

In doing so, the Trump administration has even sought to threaten and penalize some states that have tried to furnish benefits to residents in full. At one point over the weekend, the government demanded that these states needed to immediately “undo” that work and threatened them with financial punishment if they did not, prompting a broad outcry.

On Monday, a judge in Massachusetts granted a request by more than two dozen states to temporarily block the federal government from carrying out that directive. Ahead of a hearing in that case, scheduled for later Monday, many state officials sharply rebuked the Trump administration for continuing the fight. They said the decision to appeal — on a day when the Senate was making progress on a funding deal — was especially punitive and harmful.

Letitia James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, said in a news conference that states would use “every legal pathway to ensure families get the benefits they are entitled to.”

“It is a moral imperative,” she said, “and no one should go hungry because their own government is refusing to feed them.”

Ms. James was joined by other state attorneys general, including Matthew J. Platkin of New Jersey, who described the federal government’s attempts to slash food stamps as “the most heinous thing” he had seen in office.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The legal saga began late last month, after a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the administration to explore ways to furnish food stamp payments for November. When the government failed to comply quickly — and as some families faced the prospect they might not receive any aid at all — the judge instructed the government to tap all of its available funds to pay benefits in full.

Shortly after that ruling, many states began to provide those benefits to some of the Americans who receive SNAP and had been waiting days for aid. But the Trump administration refused to back down, turning first to an appeals court, which denied its first request, before escalating the fight to the Supreme Court.

There, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay, to buy the appeals court more time to review the matter. That scrambled the work underway to ship payments to low-income Americans, and by the weekend, created vast uncertainty and disruption felt by families around the country.

By late Sunday, though, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit handed down its latest decision: It denied the administration’s request in a scathing, 29-page opinion that also severely faulted its tactics during the shutdown.

“For low-income Americans, SNAP is a vital bulwark against hunger and food insecurity,” the appellate court said. “Access to food is, of course, a basic human need.”

The appellate judges said the government “knew full well” that its original plan — making only partial SNAP payments — “would be technically difficult.” And the opinion acknowledged that the Trump administration had “proceeded to do nothing to attempt to solve that problem” in ways that would have preserved the food stamp program and spared it from significant delays.

Diane Yentel, the president of the National Council of Nonprofits, one of the organizations that had sued the government over SNAP, praised the appeals decision in a statement on Monday. “The administration’s callous and cruel use of hungry Americans as a political tool must end,” she said.

Many who seek to limit immigration to the United States argue that social cohesion is impossible when any state absorbs too many newcomers at once.
Immigrants are woven into American life as our neighbors, our fellow worshipers, our friends and family.","“States have the right and the duty to protect their borders.” These words came not from President Trump, or any other American politician, but from Pope Leo XIV on Oct. 23. That recognition provides the rationale for nations to protect the basic rights and way of life of their citizens—and also recognizes the enormous stresses on social and physical infrastructure that open borders can produce. But the assertion of that standard was followed by an appeal to human conscience that every American needs to hear. This right of every nation to secure its borders, Pope Leo said, “should be balanced by the moral obligation to provide refuge.”

The pope said that many nations are ignoring this moral obligation: “Ever more inhuman measures are being adopted—even celebrated politically—that treat these ‘undesirables’ as if they were garbage and not human beings.”

It was a clear reference to the migration policies of the developed nations of the world, including the United States, a nation that still displays on its most revered monument words that our ancestors—refugees—saw as a balm and a promise: “Give me your tired, your poor,/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

The pope’s words came during yet another day of violence and confrontation on the streets of the United States, where the masked agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency continue a crusade of intimidation, terrorizing residents in cities across the country. On Oct. 8, millions of Americans saw the image of an ICE agent firing a pepper-spray projectile directly into the face of a Christian pastor who was advocating for those bearing the brunt of ICE actions in Chicago, a city recently singled out by Mr. Trump as “a hellhole” in need of federal intervention. And on Oct. 27, ICE agents dragged a 67-year-old Chicago resident—a U.S. citizen—from his car, breaking six of his ribs and causing internal bleeding. The incident occurred during an ICE raid on a children’s Halloween parade.

Those recorded acts of violence have been accompanied over the past few months by many more unseen and completely unnecessary violations of human dignity and American law by agents of ICE and other government agencies against both new migrants and longtime American citizens.

The words of Pope Leo—and the fundamental promise of America inscribed at the feet of the Statue of Liberty—are also under attack in that violence. So, too, are two traditions. First is the centuries-old compact in the United States that people deserve due process, the right to protest and the protection of the rule of law. The second is the internationally recognized right stated in the United Nations Global Compact on Migration (from which the United States withdrew during the first Trump administration) that migrants “are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, which must be respected, protected and fulfilled at all times.”

They are not “garbage”; they are not vermin to be eradicated; they are not the enemy. They are here in the United States seeking the same rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” with which we are all endowed by our creator.

Where did we go wrong?

When did the notion that we should protect our borders and regulate immigration devolve into a determination to unleash anonymous masked agents pulling people from cars, and to publicly celebrate the creation of true hellholes like the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility?

The Trump administration would have us believe that migrants are here to steal American jobs, to commit crime, to pollute our unique way of life. These are in some cases the same tropes used by Nazi criminals whom Americans died to overthrow in World War II. They are also an echo of the ugliest instincts of human nature. And they are, at their core, sentiments that are un-American, ones that betray our heritage as they also betray the words of the Gospel.

Americans now hear and see stories on a daily basis about people detained by ICE, both residents and visitors to the United States, who are held without a charge for weeks, and stories of those who have sought to obey American jurisprudence being seized outside the very courtrooms they were summoned to in observance of the law.

The positive contributions of immigrants to the United States are being deliberately denigrated, even as citizens reap the bounty of their work in industries where Americans simply will not toil under current conditions: agriculture, manual labor and in the many other industries that contribute to our national economic output and the necessities of daily life. No one, for example, has offered an alternative to the current economic system that orders our nation’s farm life, from the breadbaskets of California to the processing plants of the Midwest. Far from compensating our agricultural workers (42 percent of whom are undocumented) with a living wage and a chance at upward mobility, our politicians are terrorizing them, telling them they are not welcome while pretending the sweat of their brows is not what keeps our economy and society robust.

People of faith across the country have stood up for these least in the past few months, often with admirable tenacity and courage, but we need to do more. The Gospel mandates it, to say nothing of history and economic reality.

On a practical level, we have also created a situation in many cities where the supposed forces of law and order are creating chaos, a classic example of setting fires to claim credit for putting them out. The public scenes provoked by ICE agents have been used in several cases by Mr. Trump to justify the deployment of National Guard troops to cities to restore order—actions that have been opposed in almost every case by the governors and mayors tasked with local governance.

Many who seek to limit immigration to the United States argue that social cohesion is impossible when any state absorbs too many newcomers at once. The response of terrorizing communities with inhumane immigration enforcement, however, demonstrates the moral blindness of this claim. It is not undocumented immigrants who threaten social cohesion in our cities, but rather the tactic of forcing them to choose between self-deportation or living in fear of arrest and detention.

Immigrants are woven into American life as our neighbors, our fellow worshipers, our friends and family. As the past months have amply demonstrated, it is not possible to target immigrants en masse without also targeting the communities of which they are an integral part. In that sense, the immoral and violent tactics presently being used for immigration enforcement are a true reflection of the goals at which they aim. They are also a compelling argument for why such goals are a betrayal of not only American values but also of the Gospel.

WASHINGTON – Earlier this month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested a criminal illegal alien who is a confirmed member of the 18th Street Gang, a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), and was on El Salvador’s most wanted gang members’ list.

Antonio Israel Lazo-Quintanilla was arrested by ICE in October. While technically his only crime in the United States is driving without a license, this illegal alien is wanted in El Salvador for aggravated homicide, extortion, possession of drugs, and a litany of other felonies.

70% of the illegal aliens arrested by ICE have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. But this statistic doesn’t even count gang members, terrorists, human rights abusers, and foreign fugitives who lack a rap sheet in the U.S.

“70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the United States,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This gang member on El Salvador’s most wanted list is a perfect example of ICE targeting the worst of the worst. He may lack a violent rap sheet in the U.S. but this criminal illegal alien is clearly a public safety threat. The media’s false claims that ICE is not arresting the worst of the worst simply has no grounding. In reality, ICE is arresting criminal illegal aliens BEFORE they can victimize Americans.”

Despite the clear and present danger posed by criminal illegal aliens, the mainstream media continues to whip up violence against ICE and DHS law enforcement by falsely claiming DHS is not targeting the worst of the worst. Below are some examples of the most egregious headlines:

Please note that the views of outside contributors do not reflect the official opinions of SCOTUSblog or its staff.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to revive President Donald Trump’s attempt to narrow access to birthright citizenship. As the justices consider the administration’s request, three important briefs submitted to the court hint at an even more significant departure from the broad access to citizenship that has defined U.S. law since the late 19th century. The Justice Department’s petition requesting review, backed up by an amicus brief submitted by Republican members of the House of Representatives and another by Republican Senators, suggest that the Trump administration may be preparing to deny U.S. citizenship to children whose parents are U.S. citizens if the parents, or the children, are also citizens of another country.

The 14th Amendment citizenship clause provides U.S. citizenship to everyone “born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Since 1898, courts and executive branch agencies have interpreted the amendment’s citizenship clause broadly. Almost everyone born in the United States since then has been treated as a U.S. citizen from birth. On his first day back in the White House, the president issued an executive order directing executive branch agencies to deny U.S. citizenship to certain children born in the United States based on the citizenship and immigration status of their parents. Trump’s order does not target the children of U.S. citizens or permanent resident fathers.

The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to review a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit blocking implementation of the president’s directive. The justices have not yet issued a decision about the government’s request.

In the Justice Department’s petition requesting Supreme Court review, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the federal government’s lead Supreme Court lawyer, defends the president’s executive order by analyzing the citizenship clause’s language regarding jurisdiction. He argues that the citizenship clause excludes the children of people who do not owe “allegiance” to the United States. Relying on the court’s 1873 decision in the Slaughter-House Cases – the court’s “first case interpreting the Citizenship Clause” – Sauer argues that the citizenship clause excludes from U.S. citizenship children born to “citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States.” Although it is not made explicit in the brief, dual citizens are also citizens of a foreign government and so Sauer’s sweeping argument could deny citizenship to their children. And indeed, Sauer does not limit this broad claim anywhere in the government’s written arguments.

A few pages later, Sauer claims that a proper reading of the citizenship clause demands measuring the “allegiance” of a child born in the United States. Sauer quotes a speech by Senator Lyman Trumbull in 1866 appearing to support the view that the citizenship clause should not apply to children who are citizens of another country. “What do we mean by ‘subject to the jurisdiction of the United States?’ Not owing allegiance to anybody else,” Trumbull said in a passage that Sauer quotes. Since dual citizens owe allegiance to another country as much as the United States, they wouldn’t satisfy Trumbull’s test. Trumbull’s view of the citizenship clause should matter, according to Sauer, because he was “the principal sponsor in the Senate” of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, a federal law that contained language regarding citizenship that was similar to what would later appear in the 14th Amendment.

The briefs by Republican elected officials echo Sauer’s arguments. The 18 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 9 U.S. Senators, whose briefs are identical except for the parties, are represented by the America First Legal Foundation, the non-governmental organization founded by Trump’s immigration advisor Stephen Miller. The briefs repeatedly argue that the jurisdiction required by the citizenship clause excludes citizens of another country. In the opening paragraph of their argument, the elected officials claim that the only people who are “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,” as the 14th Amendment requires, are those who “owe direct and exclusive allegiance to the sovereign.” Later, they claim that “no one can have two countries.” Discussing the Slaughter-House Cases, they argue that the citizenship clause excludes “children whose parents remained citizens of another country,” as “they lacked total allegiance to the United States.”

Following Sauer, the politicians contend that their restrictive view of the citizenship clause is bolstered by debates surrounding the Civil Rights Act of 1866. According to their brief, Senator John Bingham – who they describe as “a principal author of the future Fourteenth Amendment” – said that the act’s citizenship provision applied to the children “of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty,” italicizing the text for emphasis. “This invoked the concept of total allegiance to the United States,” the politicians add in the next sentence. Quoting the same statement by Trumbull that Sauer quotes, the elected officials’ briefs argue, “Any divided loyalty meant no citizenship.” Leaving no doubt that they believe that the citizenship clause excludes people based on their citizenship status as well as that of their parents, the elected officials note, “If the parents or child had divided allegiances, the child would not be a U.S. citizen under the Jurisdiction Clause.”

Applied literally, these arguments would deny U.S. citizenship to children if either they or their parents were citizens of another country when the child was born. President Trump’s executive order does not go that far, so it is unlikely that the court would either at this point. Still, the fact that the briefs reach more broadly than the president’s order suggests that advocates for narrowing access to U.S. citizenship have already thought of another target.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 16:05:43.347251

SENATE SHUTDOWN DEAL: Senators have reached a tentative bipartisan agreement to end the government shutdown, sources with knowledge of the details said. The proposal would advance three full-year spending bills for certain agencies and a short-term measure to fund the rest of the government at current spending levels through Jan. 30.

TRUMP ISSUES 2020 PARDONS: President Donald Trump pardoned Rudy Giuliani and dozens of others involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, Ed Marin, said late last night. The pardons are largely symbolic, as none of the people listed were convicted of federal crimes, which the presidential pardon covers.

Jeffries vows to continue fight over health care costs when the House receives the bill to reopen government from the Senate

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.,said House Democrats will “continue to wage this fight” over health care costs when the Senate sends the amended short-term government spending bill back to the House, adding that the eight Democratic senators who voted with Republicans last night to take up the measure owe their constituents an explanation.

“I’m not going to explain what a handful of Senate Democrats have decided to do, that’s their explanation to offer to the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. “What we’re going to continue to do as House Democrats, partnered with our allies throughout America, is to wage the fight.”

Jeffries also referred to House Republicans who in recent weeks have said, like Democrats have, that Affordable Care Act tax credits need to be extended, saying “now is their chance.”

Jeffries stood by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after some House Democrats called for new leadership following yesterday’s vote. When asked if he thinks Schumer is effective and should keep his job, Jeffries said “yes and yes.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders endorses Minnesota Lt. Gov Peggy Flanagan for Senate

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan for retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith's seat.

Flanagan, who serves as lieutenant governor under Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, wrote in a post on X, ""@BernieSanders has fought for working families since Day One. He’s built a movement that is taking on special interests and fighting for an economy that works for everyone. I’m honored to have earned his endorsement of my campaign for US Senate.""

The independent senator reposted Flanagan's message on Instagram.

Sanders said in a statement provided to The New York Times that Flanagan has “the guts to stand up for working people against the billionaires and the corporate interests.”

Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., is the other candidate running in the Democratic Senate primary in Minnesota next year.

Sanders' endorsement of Flanagan came as he has expressed opposition to a deal to end the government shutdown that a group of Senate Democrats decided to advance last night.

In a post on X yesterday, Craig slammed the agreement as well because it doesn't guarantee any extensions to expiring Obamacare subsidies and said she plans to vote against it.

Supreme Court skeptical of Rastafarian man’s religious rights claim

The Supreme Court appeared unlikely this morning to allow a devout Rastafarian to bring a damages claim against Louisiana prison officials who cut his dreadlocks in violation of his religious rights.

Based on the morning argument, a majority of the justices did not appear to think Congress specifically allowed for state officials to be sued under a federal law called the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is often solicitous toward religious claims, although the bulk of recent cases have involved cases brought by conservative Christians.

Johnson tells lawmakers the House could vote on a bill to reopen government on Wednesday

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., laid out a potential timetable for the House schedule this week, including a vote on a government funding bill, during a conference call with House Republicans this morning, four sources on the call said.

Johnson said he’s hoping to vote as soon as Wednesday on the Senate’s deal to re-open the government, although that will depend on how quickly the Senate is able to move, the sources said. Although the vote timing is fluid, members were encouraged on the call to start getting back to Washington as soon as possible given the air travel delays.

The speaker also vowed that before the House votes, he will swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., who won a special election on Sept. 23. Following her swearing-in, the House will then vote on a rule for the Senate deal, followed by final passage, and then the House will leave town again, Johnson told members on the call.

While the vote is expected to be tight, and leadership is still in the process of doing a whip check, Johnson expressed confidence that they would be able to pass the Senate’s government funding package, the sources said.

Christine Pelosi to run for California state Senate instead of her mother's House seat

Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced today that she is running for a state Senate seat, ending speculation that she might run for her mother's seat in the House.

""I'm running to represent you, San Francisco, in Sacramento,"" she said in her announcement video. ""Fighting for consumer rights, women's rights, gun violence survivors, immigrants and our most vulnerable communities against the threat we face.""

Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she would not seek re-election. Her daughter is a Democratic strategist and attorney and is running for the seat currently held by state Sen. Scott Wiener, who is seeking Pelosi's congressional seat.

N.Y. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani selects key aide and de Blasio alum for 2 top posts

Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani named his appointments for key administration roles this morning, tapping campaign manager Elle Bisgaard-Church as chief of staff and public service veteran Dean Fuleihan for deputy mayor.

Fuleihan, who has decades of experience in New York politics, is a more conventional choice for a top post. He was director of New York City's Office of Management and Budget under Mayor Bill de Blasio and served as de Blasio's first deputy mayor from 2018 to 2021.

""I will turn to Dean for council, not only for his wealth of managerial experience, but also because of the similarity between our visions for this city,"" Mamdani said.

Bisgaard-Church managed Mamdani's primary and general election campaigns. She also worked as his chief of staff during his time as a state representative in Albany, N.Y.

""Few have played a more central role in this movement, or in every victory we achieved together in the assembly than Elle,"" Mamdani said. ""Together, alongside Dean, she will be responsible for ensuring that our commitment to excellence remains inviolable.""

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman will not run for re-election

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., announced she will not run for re-election in 2026 after her sixth term concludes.

Watson Coleman, 80, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2014 making her the first African American woman from New Jersey to do so, her office noted in a news release. Before being elected to Congress, she served as majority leader of the New Jersey General Assembly.

In a statement, Watson Coleman said she made the decision after much reflection and conversations with her family.

""I have always stood on the frontlines in the fight for principled progressive policies and my work has centered on the belief that there must be a floor below which we should never allow any child, family, or person to fall,"" she said, adding that her legislative record on issues such as criminal justice, health care, poverty and the economy reflected those priorities.

""I hope we will see, in this district and districts across the nation, representatives who, in the words of my dear former colleague and friend, Congressman John Lewis, stand ready to, 'Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America,'” she said.

Trump criticizes air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown

In a post to Truth Social, Trump slammed air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown and also recommended bonuses for those who stayed on the job.

""For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn’t take ANY TIME OFF for the 'Democrat Shutdown Hoax,' I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country,"" Trump said in a post.

""For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,"" he added.

Trump said those who took days off ""will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record,"" and encouraged those who might want to leave their jobs, saying, ""please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind.""

The Federal Aviation Administration had a shortage of air traffic controllers before the shutdown, which has caused flight delays and cancellations across the nation.

Johnson urges House members to travel to D.C. for a shutdown vote

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., this morning urged House members to begin traveling back to D.C. to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Johnson said he would issue an official 36-hour notice before votes in the House.

“There’ll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” Johnson said of the work to be done when the House returns.

The House could have stayed in session during the shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, but he chose to designate every week since Sept. 19 a district work period.

Senators reached a bipartisan agreement yesterday to advance a bill that would end the shutdown, NBC has reported.

6 killed in U.S. strikes on 2 more alleged drug boats in eastern Pacific

U.S. forces struck two more boats allegedly operated by drug cartels in the eastern Pacific yesterday, killing six people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement.

The latest in a string of similar operations against what the U.S. government calls “designated terrorist organizations,” the two strikes were carried out in international waters and three men were aboard each vessel, Hegseth said.

“These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said on X.

China suspends port fees on U.S. ships as tensions ease

China announced today that it has dropped countermeasures on U.S.-linked vessels for a year as trade tensions ease between Washington and Beijing.

Effective at 12:01 ET today, the Chinese Transport Ministry suspended its port fees and investigations related to American ships following the U.S. move to pause investigations into China’s maritime industry.

The suspension was part of a consensus reached by U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in Kuala Lumpur last month, the ministry said.

Beijing also dropped sanctions targeting five U.S. subsidiaries of the South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean.

Trump's attorneys demand BBC issue a retraction, threaten to sue

Trump's attorneys sent a letter to the British Broadcasting Corp. over the weekend demanding a retraction and threatening to seek $1 billion in damages from the broadcaster.

The move comes amid a growing controversy over edits to the president’s infamous Jan. 6 ellipse speech in a documentary that aired on the BBC. Two top BBC executives have already resigned.

The White House referred NBC News' request for comment to an outside legal team.

“The BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election,” a spokesman for the president’s outside legal team told NBC News. “President Trump will continue to hold accountable those who traffic in lies, deception, and fake news.”

A BBC spokesperson told NBC News, “We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”

Critics have framed the BBC's edits of Trump's Jan. 6 speech as misleading and criticized the decision to cut a portion of the president's speech when he told supporters to protest peacefully.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness left the company.

Turness said in a letter to staff members that she was stepping down because ""leaders need to be fully accountable.""

""While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,"" Turness said.

Supreme Court to weigh imposing new limits on mail-in ballots in a major election case

Taking up a contentious election issue with nationwide implications, the Supreme Court this morning agreed to consider whether federal law bars states from counting mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day.

The case pits Republican-led Mississippi, defending its election law that allows for mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted, against the Republican National Committee and the state’s own Republican Party. The Libertarian Party of Mississippi also joined the challenge in opposing the law.

If the RNC’s argument were applied nationwide, it would upend election law in many states, which count ballots that come in after an election as long as they were postmarked on time. Many of those laws were designed to ensure that overseas military members who submit ballots from afar have their votes counted.

Supreme Court rejects long-shot effort to overturn same-sex marriage ruling

The Supreme Court this morning turned away a long-shot attempt to overturn the landmark 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

Without comment, the justices rejected an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who was sued in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her opposition to same-sex marriage based on her religious beliefs.

Her latest appeal in the case, brought a decade later, had attracted considerable attention amid fears that the court could overturn the 2015 same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, in the aftermath of the 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade.

Democrats seek investigation into agency messages blaming Democrats for the shutdown

A group of Senate Democrats is pushing for an investigation into the Trump administration’s use of federal agency websites and emails to post partisan messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.

In a letter obtained by NBC News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other Democrats are asking the Government Accountability Office to open a probe into whether the political messages violated federal appropriations laws.

The lawmakers point specifically to a rule that prohibits the executive branch from using funds for “purely partisan” purposes. They are asking for more information from the GAO to see if several agencies violated laws that pertain to ethics and partisan political activity.

Senators advance tentative deal to end the government shutdown

Senators struck an agreement Sunday, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News.

The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government.

Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer confirmed to the justices that the federal government intends to ask the high court to pause orders from lower courts to maintain full SNAP payments, which provide federal food assistance to families in need.

His notice comes after a federal appeals court late Sunday rejected the administration’s bid to halt U.S. District Judge John McConnell’s order, which directed the government to fund November SNAP payments by transferring some $4 billion in child nutrition funds.

Though those payments remain frozen under a Friday night ruling from Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the appeals court’s decision starts a 48-hour clock for it to expire.

It also comes as Congress moves closer to reopening the government, which Sauer noted in his letter to the court.

He flagged for the justices that the Senate on Sunday voted to begin the process for funding the government, which would include full funding for SNAP through the end of the fiscal year.

“That proposal, if ultimately adopted by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President, would end the shutdown and moot this application,” Sauer wrote.

The solicitor general also noted that a federal judge issued another temporary injunction Monday morning tied to the SNAP payments.

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani temporarily paused a U.S. Department of Agriculture memorandum that said states that sent full SNAP payment files for November must “immediately undo any steps taken to issue” full benefits.

Sauer said the government would file a supplemental brief by 4 p.m. EST.

The Trump administration first appealed to the Supreme Court after McConnell ruled that the administration needed to provide full SNAP payments for November by last Friday, after finding it was acting arbitrarily and capriciously by not transferring the child nutrition funds to fully fund SNAP during the shutdown. He had previously ruled that the administration needed to deplete a $5 billion SNAP emergency fund, at minimum, to ensure benefits went to families and people with no or limited incomes.

Justice Department lawyers argued that such a move would unacceptably put those programs at risk, and Sauer contended it would “sow further shutdown chaos.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP25311542469710-e1762721157989.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-10 16:05:34.854976

Nonprofit civil rights organization Faith in Action East Bay, based in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, organized the afternoon march to denounce what they see as illegal and immoral racial profiling, separation of families, and violation of detention rights. They advocated for the departure of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents from the Bay Area.

Marchers gathered outside the federal San Francisco Immigration Court before walking half a mile to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services building.

The steady beat of a drum played while the group continuously sang a hymn that switched between the names of different deities, demonstrating the presence of several faith groups.

Rabbi Allan Berkowitz helped organize the walk and spoke about what he believes is a gross violation of human rights and dignity.

“Every single faith tradition represented today carries values and messages that people matter,” said Berkowitz. “What unites us is the commitment to preserve the sanctity of every human being.”

Berkowitz likened the actions of today’s clergy against President Donald Trump’s administration as a similar action by previous faith leaders, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

“Very often it’s clergy who show the moral courage and show the moral leadership to stand up to dictators and stand up to oppression,” said Berkowitz.

After arriving outside of the USCIS building, the group set up a vigil across the street. Organizers and San Francisco police shut down half the street to accommodate the large crowd.

The Rev. Deborah Lee, co-executive director of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, denounced the activities going on within the federal building.

“Today, this is a place of arrest, of kidnappings, family separation. This is a point of captivity, a point of no return into the web of detention centers, exile and deportation, sometimes to third-party countries,” said Lee.

Growing numbers of detainees

The Migration Policy Institute, an independent nonprofit that tracks immigration data and policies, estimated over 60,000 people were being detained by the Trump administration as of late August. In comparison, there were nearly 40,000 people detained when former President Joe Biden left office in January.

According to the Deportation Data Project, a team made up of professors and students across the University of California system, over 2,000 individuals in the San Francisco area alone have been detained by ICE since the start of the Trump administration.

The project noted, however, they do not expect new data to be released during the government shutdown, potentially drastically undercounting the number of detentions.

The Rev. Katie Choy-Wong spoke to the crowd about her grandparents’ experiences as undocumented Chinese migrants who faced prejudice and bias when arriving to the Bay Area. She offered a prayer to all people involved in the immigration enforcement system, including the officials, in a hope their minds would change.

“Help us to support our brothers and sisters being detained, deported, dehumanized, demoralized, not only support them in our prayers, but in a tangible way,” said Choy-Wong. “We pray that (government officials) look into their own conscience. We pray, oh God, that they treat people with respect, decency and nonviolence. We pray that they use their capacity to fight injustice from within.”

When asked whether he had glimmers of hope for the future, Berkowitz said the results of Tuesday’s elections in favor of Democratic policies was something that gave him hope.

“I think Tuesday was a sign, a reminder that there is reason to hope and that there are good people out there, and there are people taking a stand and saying, ‘We can do better, and we must do better as a society,’” said Berkowitz.",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LNM-20251107-ICEWALK-02.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:56.009964

As the Trump administration adds federal law enforcement focus to Portland, Oregon, local officials in neighboring areas are pushing back on the Department of Homeland Security and investigating their own police forces for alleged collaboration.

Unrest in the Portland area grabbed President Donald Trump’s attention over the summer – and by late September – he announced deployment of troops to the ""war-ravaged"" city – an effort that Trump-appointed Judge Karin Immergut blocked in October.

Washington County, an area home to about 600,000 people immediately west of Portland, declared a state of emergency last week in response to DHS’ increased enforcement in the area.

The move opens up $200,000 in emergency funding to help community organizations that serve impacted residents, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB).

An immigrations rights group official was one of several residents to complain about ICE ramping up enforcement, telling OPB that her organization was receiving 100 phone calls on the matter daily and that broken glass is ""everywhere"" from ICE officers breaking car windows to detain occupants.

County Commissioner Nafisa Fai told the outlet that residents may benefit from moratoriums on evictions and having their electricity shut off over nonpayment if breadwinners in their family are taken away by ICE.

Effective October 30, 2025, most employment authorization document (EAD) renewal applications that previously qualified for the 540-day automatic extension will no longer receive this benefit. However, applications filed before October 30, 2025, will remain unaffected by this change.

This policy shift marks a significant departure from previous DHS practices and could impact thousands of workers and employers who rely on extended work authorization during processing delays.

Background

Under prior policy guidance, certain foreign nationals who timely filed to renew their employment authorization were eligible for an automatic extension of up to 540 days. This policy helped eligible foreign nationals avoid disruptions in their employment authorization amid increasingly lengthy U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processing times.

DHS asserts that this policy change is consistent with several of the Trump administration’s executive orders and the administration’s overarching immigration policy.

Impacted Categories

Several commonly impacted employment eligibility categories include:

A-3: Refugee

A-5: Asylee

A-17: Spouse of a principal E nonimmigrant

A-18: Spouse of a principal L nonimmigrant

C-8: Pending Asylum

C-9: Pending Adjustment of Status under Section 245 of the INA

C-26: Spouses of certain H-1B principal nonimmigrants

It is important to note that this interim final rule does not affect the 180-day automatic extension available to F-1 students applying for STEM OPT extensions. The STEM OPT extension is authorized under a separate regulatory framework and therefore remains outside the scope of the recent IFR. USCIS has previously confirmed that 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) does not apply to F-1 STEM OPT extensions. While the IFR does not expressly state that STEM OPT is excluded, it acknowledges that its provisions do not alter other regulatory authorities, such as those governing Temporary Protected Status.

Best Practices for Foreign Nationals and Employers

Foreign nationals in the affected categories can no longer rely on automatic extensions once their EAD expires. As a result, depending on USCIS processing times, foreign nationals and employers should be prepared for potential gaps in employment authorization. To minimize disruptions, employers should continue to monitor EAD expiration dates and encourage employees to file renewal applications as early as possible – up to 180 days before the current EAD expires. Early filing is critical to reducing the risk of work authorization interruptions due to delayed adjudication.

The increased risk for federal contractors and recipients of federal funds takes several forms.

E-Verify. Two noteworthy FCA cases this year reflect a crackdown on federal contractors’ failure to use E-Verify to confirm that their employees were eligible to work in the United States. DOJ announced in September that Bayonne Drydock and Repair Corporation agreed to pay more than $4 million to resolve allegations that it violated the FCA by employing immigrants lacking work authorization for work under two federal contracts. This settlement follows an announcement in January — during the final days of the Biden administration — that a different federal contractor had agreed to pay just over $1 million to resolve similar allegations. Both cases alleged that the contractors failed to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-54, which requires employers to electronically confirm employees’ employment eligibility in the federal E-Verify database. These settlements underscore the importance of government contractors monitoring their compliance — and their subcontractors’ compliance — with E-Verify requirements.

PRWORA. Potential FCA exposure also might arise from the Trump administration’s July announcement that it was effectively rescinding longstanding guidance under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). PRWORA provides that an organization that administers a “federal public benefit” is required to verify an applicant’s immigration status before issuing benefits (with limited exceptions for charitable organizations in certain circumstances). The Trump administration’s interpretation of the law significantly expands the number of federal benefit programs that are subject to the immigration-status restrictions — including Head Start programs, Title X family planning clinics, community services block grant programs, and community health centers. Although many of these policy changes are currently enjoined in a number of states and as to Head Start nationwide, other aspects are in effect and could give rise to potential FCA liability.

“Sanctuary Cities.” Many federal agencies — including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — have announced new conditions on federal grants requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. These conditions are often accompanied by conditions related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Although multiple jurisdictions have successfully obtained injunctions against these new conditions, where they apply, the terms could create additional FCA risk for jurisdictions that accept the federal funds but are later deemed uncooperative by federal immigration officials.

These are just three examples of how the Trump administration could continue to advance its immigration policy priorities through FCA enforcement. Government contractors and grant recipients should take proactive steps, including by carefully reviewing their agreements with and certifications to the government, as well as their immigration-verification compliance mechanisms. Early attention to these issues can help mitigate risk and avoid costly investigations or enforcement actions.

How long will Wisconsin farmers continue to believe this administration is on their side?
Many hope the short-term pain of Trump’s tariffs will pay off in the long term, with a stronger and more stable U.S. economy.
Until recently, many Wisconsin dairy farmers and their workers hoped to remain under the radar, even as immigration raids have caused chaos in other states.
Wisconsin dairy farmers skated through the first Trump administration without any dairy farm raids.","President Donald Trump’s tariffs, trade wars and immigration crackdown are taking a toll on Wisconsin farmers. For almost six months, China refused to purchase U.S. soybeans in response to Trump’s escalating tariffs, leaving Wisconsin farmers with no customer for their bumper soybean crop this year. Commodity prices are low, due to high yields and depressed demand. And recently after a long period of quiet, federal immigration agents arrived in Wisconsin, targeting construction workers in Madison and farm hands in Manitowoc — bad news for Wisconsin’s dairy industry, where 60-90% of the workforce is comprised of undocumented immigrants.

It’s an anxious, uncertain time in rural areas of the state.

Yet on a recent drive from Madison to Reedsburg, I passed dozens of giant Trump signs planted among the corn and soybean fields and banners declaring “Take America Back!” on the sides of red barns.

How long will Wisconsin farmers continue to believe this administration is on their side?

National polls show rural support for the president remains strong, even as farmers say their own economic situation is weakening. Many hope the short-term pain of Trump’s tariffs will pay off in the long term, with a stronger and more stable U.S. economy. Ever since he first ran for president in 2016, Trump appealed to many farmers with his pitch that he would remember “the forgotten men and women of America” and, especially, with his criticism of global trade deals like NAFTA, which accelerated the “get big or get out” trend in agriculture that helped kill off more than half of family farms in our state since the early 2000s.

Year after year, Wisconsin was the No. 1 state for farm bankruptcies in the country, as the number of dairies dropped from 16,000 in 2004 to fewer than 7,000 today. Since 2023, we no longer lead the country in bankruptcies — consolidation and foreclosure have simply weeded out so many farms that there aren’t that many left to shut down.

When things have been as bad as they have been for as long as they have, it’s not surprising that Trump’s brash, anti-establishment message resonated with rural voters. Many hoped that he would throw a rock at the whole system and shake up what felt like an impossibly rigged economy. Alas, it turns out it’s possible for things to go from bad to even worse.

Recently, Trump promised to use some of the revenue generated by his chaotic tariffs on other countries’ products to make bailout payments to farmers, although the status of those payments is up in the air during the government shutdown. Even without the shutdown, converting tariff revenue into subsidies for U.S. farmers is “not even like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It’s like robbing Peter to pay Peter,” Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former senior adviser for rural development at USDA, told me. Tariffs are essentially a tax on domestic consumers, who have been paying much higher prices for goods like farm equipment and fertilizer. Taking that money and giving it back in the form of a handout to the same farmers who paid for the tariffs in the first place is no real solution.

Plus, getting another bailout “isn’t what farmers want. We want to receive our money from the marketplace and let that process work out,” Darin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, told the Green Bay Fox affiliate WLUK-TV.

Von Ruden recently hosted a listening session on his farm in Westby, part of a multistate tour by Farmers for Free Trade to dramatize the harm done by tariffs. The group hopes to pressure members of Congress to recognize the problem and vote to change course. But so far Republican members of Congress in Wisconsin seem determined to show how loyal they are to Trump, even if that means a whole lot of pain for their constituents.

Beyond the next bailout for farmers, whenever that might come, unstable markets caused by trade wars are a long-term problem. Soybean farmers say it will take years to regain a good trading relationship with China. And there is no thoughtful government effort underway to support smaller, local and regional food economies. Meanwhile the looming loss of health care and food assistance under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” also threatens lasting damage to rural Wisconsin.

And then there are the ICE raids. For decades, Wisconsin dairy farms have depended on an immigrant workforce that does not qualify for any form of work visa under current rules, since the U.S. government only offers visas for seasonal, not year-round farm work. More than half of the workers on Wisconsin dairy farms are undocumented immigrants. Until recently, many Wisconsin dairy farmers and their workers hoped to remain under the radar, even as immigration raids have caused chaos in other states. Across the country this year, half of farmers report contending with a serious labor shortage, according to Zach Rutledge, an ag researcher at Michigan State University.

Wisconsin dairy farmers skated through the first Trump administration without any dairy farm raids. This year, high-profile ICE crackdowns in Chicago and Los Angeles seemed far away and farmers could kid themselves that Trump was only trying to round up “bad” immigrants, not the hardworking people they employ. But then came the arrests in Manitowoc, a big dairy producing area of the state, and the startling roundup of seven construction workers who shared a house in Madison.

In late October, Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the Twin Cities and defended a raid that snatched a group of roofers off a work site in St. Paul.

The cruelty, the waste, the lack of any coherent plan by this administration is becoming clearer and clearer.

According to one dairy farmer I know, farmers have received mixed signals from the Trump administration, with the ag and labor secretaries assuring them they understand the importance of the immigrant workforce, while Stephen Miller continues to press for mass deportations, consequences be damned.

Trump, busy building his massive White House ballroom, remains distracted, unpredictable, unconcerned about the chaos he has unleashed. Sooner or later, even his core constituency, the people who put food on our tables and who are accustomed to enduring economic uncertainty and hardship year after year, are bound to get fed up.

This month we provide updates on the Crystallex sales process, Helms-Burton litigation, and developments in various cases of interest.

Crystallex

As we have previously discussed (here, here, here, and here), the United States District Court for the District of Delaware is presently holding a judicial sale of shares of Citgo's parent company, in order to satisfy tens of billions of dollars in debts owed to creditors by Venezuela and its state-owned oil company.

After holding a week of hearings in September, which we summarized in our October FTU (here), the parties conducted post-trial briefing and Judge Stark held another two days of hearings on October 20 and 21. These hearings concerned motions filed by Gold Reserve and Venezuela to disqualify the Special Master overseeing the sale process and the Special Master seeking approval of the Amber Energy bid for the PDVH shares (the entity which owns CITGO). No decision has been made by the court, which accepted post-trial briefs on October 28.

Previously, Judge Stark terminated the Gold Reserve SPA and permitted the Special Master to execute the Amber Energy SPA. However, Amber Energy's financing is only committed until December 1, 2025. Amber Energy's bid for Citgo has a total value of approximately $8.5 billion, with approximately $5.859 billion going to Venezuelan creditors, $500 million in additional consideration for creditors, and $2.125 billion in cash to settle bondholder claims against its parent company, PDVSA. (This represents a discount from the $2.8 billion judgment those bondholders recently received from the Southern District of New York; the bondholders have the right to terminate the settlement on December 1 if a sale order has not been signed.)

At the hearing, Gold Reserve argued that OFAC sanctions prevented the 2020 bondholders from taking any actions that would interfere with the merger that would be required for Gold Reserve's financing to close. Gold Reserve also argued that the court should favor price over certainty, and that the Special Master had failed to generate adequate competitive tension.

Venezuela impugned the Special Master's motives in its disqualification materials and leaned heavily on many of those same argument in its merits arguments, as well as emphasizing its previous arguments about the valuation and the price of the Amber bid. Accordingly, Venezuela argued that the proper valuation is $18.6 billion and any sale needs to be for at least 50% of that (and therefore the Amber bid is too low), and the Special Master should have done a host of things differently with respect to the sale to increase the competitive tension.

The parties who support the Amber bid, including the Special Master, Crystallex, ConocoPhillips, OIEG, Red Tree, and more, attacked Venezuela's valuation as significantly too high (relying on testimony from Venezuela's expert at the sale hearing that it was a theoretical valuation that didn't discount the litigation risk from the 2020 bonds). They also challenged Venezuela's position on the 50% rule and explained that they had found competitive tension in the sale process, which they believed was fair and in compliance with Delaware law. Many creditors challenged Gold Reserve for ignoring the fact that Judge Failla had not only found the 2020s to be valid but issued a $2.8 billion judgment, and also pointed out that because Gold Reserve lost its committed financing, it no longer has a conforming bid.

It is anticipated that a decision from Judge Stark will come out this month, in advance of the December 1, 2025 date when Amber's settlement agreement with the 2020 bondholders will terminate if a sale order has not been entered. Another issue looming over the proceedings is the necessity of obtaining a license from OFAC to allow the transaction to close.

Another Helms-Burton Case Reaches the Supreme Court

Last month, we reported on the Supreme Court's historic decision to grant certiorari in Exxon Mobil Corp. and Havana Docks—marking the first time the court has agreed to weigh in on the scope of the Helms-Burton Act (HBA). As those petitions were under consideration, a third certiorari petition concerning HBA was filed in Seaboard Marine Ltd. v. de Fernandez (No. 25-283).

The respondent-plaintiff in Seaboard, Odette Blanco de Fernandez, claims to be the surviving shareholder of two Cuban corporations that owned land and port development rights in Mariel Bay, Cuba. She alleges that a portion of the land formerly owned by one of the companies is now occupied by Cuba's principal container terminal. The defendant, Seaboard Marine, is an international shipping company that delivers goods to the terminal. De Fernandez filed suit in the Southern District of Florida, asserting that Seaboard's use of the port constitutes ""trafficking"" under the HBA. The district court granted summary judgment in Seaboard's favor, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, allowing certain claims to proceed. Seaboard's certiorari petition raises three key issues with the Eleventh Circuit's decision, which we lay out below.

Shareholder Standing to Sue for Corporate Property

Seaboard argues that the Eleventh Circuit erred in allowing de Fernandez to sue under the HBA based on her status as a shareholder. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the statute's reference to plaintiffs who ""own a claim"" reflects Congress's intent to expand the pool of eligible claimants beyond titleholders. Seaboard contends that this interpretation is overly broad, violates traditional principles of corporate separateness, and risks opening the floodgates to duplicative or competing claims from multiple shareholders of confiscated corporations.

This issue will undoubtedly be significant for future HBA cases. We expect—especially in view of the claims filed to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission—that a great number of the most valuable claims to property in Cuba are owned by corporations.

Breadth of the Definition of ""Trafficking""

The Eleventh Circuit interpreted ""trafficking"" under the HBA to include any commercial activity that ""benefits from"" confiscated property, even indirectly. Seaboard challenges this interpretation, arguing that the Act requires a more direct connection between the alleged trafficking and the property. Below, the district court found no evidence that Seaboard's freight was loaded, offloaded, or transported over the specific parcel of confiscated land. Nonetheless, the Eleventh Circuit held that Seaboard benefited from the land because the terminal's overall functionality depended on it. Seaboard argues that this reading is overly expansive and that ""benefits from"" should be limited to investment-like exploitation rather than routine commercial use.

Narrow Construction of the ""Lawful Travel"" Exception

Seaboard also argues that its shipments of agricultural goods to Cuba fall within the HBA's ""lawful travel"" exception, which exempts from liability transactions incident to lawful travel. Seaboard operated under federal regulations that authorize such exports, including humanitarian shipments. However, the Eleventh Circuit narrowly construed ""travel"" to mean only the movement of people, excluding trade-related activities. Seaboard contends that this interpretation conflicts with federal law and regulations, which explicitly link lawful travel to authorized trade.

De Fernandez initially waived her response to Seaboard's petition. However, following its November 7, 2025 conference, the Supreme Court ordered a response, which is due by December 1, 2025. We will continue to monitor developments in de Fernandez closely. Alongside Havana Docks, the Eleventh Circuit's decision in de Fernandez is among the first appellate rulings to meaningfully address the scope and application of the HBA. Unless the Supreme Court intervenes, the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation will remain a significant precedent for HBA litigants.

Other Important Developments

A variety of interesting cases in the cross-border/judgment enforcement/arbitration-adjacent areas are winding their way through the courts. Next month, we will report on a few of these in greater detail, but here are some highlights.

Petersen v. Argentina

The long-running dispute (commenced in 2015) over the Petersen plaintiffs' multibillion-dollar claim against Argentina arising out of the partial renationalization of YPF (the Argentine oil and gas company) moved into the Court of Appeals. Last week, the parties argued Argentina's appeal of a judgment entered against it by the New York federal district court. The three-judge panel was comprised of Judges Chin, Cabranes and Robinson of the US Circuit Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit. The issues on appeal include forum non conveniens, comity, whether Argentine law was properly applied, and damages methodology. Argentina's sovereign-immunity defense was rejected by the Second Circuit in 2018.

Litigation Against Spain and India

High profile sovereign litigation against Spain and India continues to proceed in US courts. Spain is seeking certiorari to the US Supreme Court over a DC Circuit decision allowing a path to enforce arbitral awards against it in favor of NextEra Energy, Inc. of approximately $386 million. Spain contends that it did not agree to arbitrate, while the claimants have prevailed on their argument that the ICSID Convention makes clear that the question of whether Spain agreed to arbitrate falls to the arbitral tribunal. Last month, the Supreme Court sought the position of the Solicitor General on the question presented.

As to India, Antrix Corp. Ltd., a state-owned commercial division of India's space agency, is urging the Ninth Circuit to once again refuse to enforce a decade-old $1.3 billion arbitral award issued to satellite communications company Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, arguing that the award has been set aside in India and that, in any case, jurisdictional obstacles stand in the litigation's way. You may recall we reported on this case previously at the Supreme Court last term, when the court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision that the FSIA required personal jurisdiction to be established over the sovereign in enforcing an arbitral award. See FTU here.

Is there a time Limit to Vacate a Void Judgment?

Today, the Supreme Court will hear challenges to President Trump's tariffs, but there is also another case being argued: whether there's a time limit for filing motions to vacate allegedly void judgments based on claims that the issuing court lacked personal jurisdiction over a party.

Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., has asked the justices to overrule a Sixth Circuit panel's refusal to vacate a 2015 default judgment against it. Coney Island Auto Parts claims the judgment was void when issued and is unenforceable now. Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited Inc. v. Burton, case number 24-808.

The Sixth Circuit (a 2-1 panel decision) held that Coney Island Auto Parts' motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), which allows motions to vacate void judgments, was untimely because it had failed to file the motion within a ""reasonable time,"" as required by Rule 60(c)(1).

Coney Island Auto Parts claims the Sixth Circuit's reading of Rule 60(c)(1) cannot be reconciled with its plain text and history or the practicality of void judgments. While the rule establishes a one-year deadline for motions to vacate based on mistakes, new evidence or fraud, it only states that motions based on other reasons should be filed in an undefined ""reasonable time."" Since void judgments are invalid from the very beginning and cannot become valid over time, the company argues they can be challenged at any time.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/MondaqThumb.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:02:48.760506

She was removed from the case last year after a judge determined she publicly leaked internal records from Dominion in violation of a court order.
“If you are wondering how it could be that people are claiming that the 2020 Election was stolen and Donald Trump was able to win in 2024, this is why,” he said.
“This is all I can say on this issue at this time.” Dominion Voting Systems was sold last month to Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican director of elections for St. Louis, Mo., and renamed Liberty Vote.
It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s sweeping pardon Sunday night for efforts to expose voting fraud would affect Lambert’s case.","The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the disqualification of an attorney accused of improperly accessing voting machines after the 2020 election as counsel in a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.

Michigan attorney Stefanie Lambert represented Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne in the defamation suit brought by Dominion, a voting technology company that conspiracists homed in on in the wake of President Trump’s 2020 election loss.

She was removed from the case last year after a judge determined she publicly leaked internal records from Dominion in violation of a court order.

A lawyer for Byrne contended to the justices that Lambert’s apparent expertise in “election fraud” has made her a threat to Dominion, prompting the company’s bid to disqualify her from representing him in the case, even as she represents him in other litigation.

“Here, Petitioner’s counsel of choice is the leading expert attorney and primary counsel in election related cases across the country and other matters involving Respondent, including a breach of contract action,” lawyer Peter Ticktin wrote in Byrne’s petition to the court.

“Respondent’s motives are evident, because it continues to engage in reactive actions and conduct demonstrating its fear that Petitioner’s counsel will be able to continue to represent Petitioner in litigation with and involving Respondent,” he said.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Dominion waived its right to respond to Byrne’s petition.

Lambert faces criminal charges in Michigan over an alleged scheme to access voting tabulators following the 2020 election, as Trump’s supporters sought evidence that he won instead of former President Biden. She was scheduled to go to trial last week, but a judge pushed the proceeding to March.

Ticktin told The Hill that the case remains open for appeal that Byrne did not have the assistance of the attorney of his choice in the Dominion litigation. He also defended Lambert’s actions, saying she gave Dominion’s discovery file to law enforcement “as she was required to do so by statute” and describing her as responsible for preventing foreign election interference in the 2024 race.

“If you are wondering how it could be that people are claiming that the 2020 Election was stolen and Donald Trump was able to win in 2024, this is why,” he said. “This is all I can say on this issue at this time.”

Dominion Voting Systems was sold last month to Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican director of elections for St. Louis, Mo., and renamed Liberty Vote. The Hill reached out for comment.

“Does Dominion even exist anymore?” Ticktin asked, attributing its apparent disappearance to Lambert.

It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s sweeping pardon Sunday night for efforts to expose voting fraud would affect Lambert’s case.

Though Lambert is not named in the pardon, it grants a “full, complete and unconditional pardon to all United States citizens” for conduct relating to both the so-called “fake electors” scheme and “any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 presidential election.”

However, presidential pardons are limited to federal offenses, not state offenses, so it is not likely that she would immediately be absolved.

“Meanwhile, US funding cuts have led to shortages in shelter, education services and aid in the Bangladesh camps, putting additional strain on communities and further compelling people to seek the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.
It is currently unclear whether the boat began its original journey in Myanmar or Bangladesh.
Malaysia has a record of pushing back migrant boats from Myanmar.
In January 2025, authorities said they had expelled two boats ferrying about 300 undocumented migrants from Myanmar from the country’s waters.","Responding to the deaths of refugees and migrants on a boat that sank off the coast of Malaysia, Amnesty International’s Myanmar Researcher Joe Freeman said:

“This latest tragedy at sea in Southeast Asia once again lays bare the deadly risks faced by Rohingya Muslims who attempt to flee conflict and persecution in Myanmar, plus deteriorating conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

“Those who were aboard a boat that sank off the coast of Malaysia had left a rapidly worsening situation both at home in Rakhine State and in overcrowded and underfunded camps over the border in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

“In Myanmar, Rohingya civilians face food shortages, forced labour, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on movement while they remain trapped in a conflict between the Myanmar junta and the Arakan Army that has driven more Rohingya into camps in Bangladesh.

“Meanwhile, US funding cuts have led to shortages in shelter, education services and aid in the Bangladesh camps, putting additional strain on communities and further compelling people to seek the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.

“The Malaysian and Thai governments must coordinate comprehensive search and rescue missions for survivors of this tragedy and provide them with humanitarian assistance and protection from forcible return to Myanmar.

“The unconscionable practice of pushing boats away from borders must end, and regional governments must ensure that any boats carrying refugees and migrants are allowed to land safely in the nearest country. ASEAN leaders must act decisively to address the long-standing issue of Rohingya boats at sea, as well as the ongoing conflict in Myanmar.”

Background to the Rohingya refugee crisis

At least 11 people are reported to have died after a boat carrying around 70 migrants and refugees sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.

The passengers were among a group of around 300 mostly Rohingya people who were originally on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats, according to Malaysian officials. It is currently unclear whether the boat began its original journey in Myanmar or Bangladesh.

Civilians in Rakhine State have been trapped in the armed conflict between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military, which has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid and carried out deadly indiscriminate air strikes. Amnesty International and other groups have also documented violations of international humanitarian law and mounting abuses against civilians by the Arakan Army, which now controls most of northern Rakhine State.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are internally displaced, and more than 150,000 Rohingya men, women and children have fled across the border to the Bangladesh camps since late 2023, bringing the total number of refugees to an estimated 1.2 million.

The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Trump administration as it attempts to crackdown on protests against immigration raids nationwide.","President Trump has issued sweeping and unconditional pardons to his top allies who aided him in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election–that’s according to the Justice Department’s pardon attorney. Among those pardoned were Rudy Giuliani, who tried to pressure state legislatures to reject Joe Biden’s victory in key swing states; Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff in 2020; John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, two attorneys who conspired to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results on Jan. 6; Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Trump; and Sidney Powell, who filed lawsuits challenging election results in key swing states. The pardons only apply to federal charges and don’t include state charges. Both Powell and Chesebro had pleaded guilty to state charges. Giuliani has been indicted in Georgia and Arizona. On Sunday, Trump also pardoned dozens of other Republicans who were involved in the plan to organize fake electors and promote conspiracies of alleged voter fraud during the 2020 election. Earlier this year, Trump had pardoned more than 1,000 Jan. 6 rioters.

The U.S. federal government shutdown has entered its 41st day. On Sunday night, seven Democratic senators broke away from their party to vote alongside Republicans on a key bill to end the shutdown and fund most government agencies until January 30. The Democratic senators include Tim Kaine of Virginia, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, as well as Maine’s Independent senator Angus King. The measure does not include an extension of the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The bill still needs to pass the House before the government can be reopened, and that would require Speaker Mike Johnson to call a House session and finally swear in Representative Elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona; she would be the final vote on a discharge petition to release the Epstein files.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that air travel would be “reduced to a trickle” if the shutdown continues. U.S. airlines canceled more than 3,500 flights over the weekend, impacting tens of thousands of travelers nationwide. Travelers expressed outrage over the delays.

bq.Traveler Delia Nau: “I’m shocked and I’m shocked. And I’m…it is definitely a Republican shutdown. It’s not the Democrats. I understand why they don’t want to take all those people off, you know, health and wellness and insurance. It’s just, it’s ridiculous.”

Israeli air raids and drone attacks continue in Gaza despite the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect a month ago. Al Jazeera reports 2 people, including a child, were killed in southern Gaza today. This is Nidal Abu Arqoub from Khan Younis.

bq.Nidal Abu Arqoub: “The future is bleak and uncertain. Given our current situation, things remain as they are. Truce, no truce, we do not see a truce. The war is ongoing, and the horizon is dark. We see the country’s situation as very difficult.”

Meanwhile, Hamas handed over the body of Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier who was killed in a 2014 war in Gaza. It comes as Reuters reports U.S. officials gathered intelligence that Israeli military lawyers warned there was evidence that war crimes charges could be brought against Israel for its war on Gaza. The former U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters said the material was not broadly circulated within the U.S. government until late in the Biden administration. Lawyers with the State Department also reportedly flagged to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel might be committing war crimes.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian man in the Far’a refugee camp. It comes as Israeli settlers attacked a group of Palestinian villagers, activists and journalists on Saturday who had gathered during an attempt to harvest olives near a settler outpost. Two Reuters journalists–including photographer Raneen Sawafta–were injured in the attack in an area close to the Palestinian village of Beita. This is Mohammed Al-Atrash, a journalist with Al Jazeera, who recounted the attack by Israeli settlers.

Mohammed Al-Atrash: “I found myself alone and all the farmers walked down, so I decided to leave the area, during that they hurled stones toward us, like nothing I have witnessed before.”

In Oregon, a federal judge has permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland. In her ruling U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointee, said the president “did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard” and that “there was neither 'a rebellion or danger of a rebellion'” in Portland, as claimed by the federal government. The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Trump administration as it attempts to crackdown on protests against immigration raids nationwide.

In Massachusetts, a video obtained by the Boston Globe shows a man having what appears to be a seizure after federal immigration agents pushed, hit and pressed on his neck when the man attempted to hold on to his wife and crying child after the agents ambushed their car. Carlos Zapata, who is from Ecuador, reportedly lost consciousness as a bystander is heard saying on the video, “They’re trying to rip the baby out of [his] hand.” His wife was taken into custody by federal agents in front of their daughter, who is 1 and a half years old.

The Homeland Security Department later mocked the video of Zapata and his family, saying he faked a seizure to try to stop his wife’s arrest. She now faces deportation.

Two top executives at the BBC on Sunday abruptly resigned following backlash over the public broadcaster’s edit of a speech made by President Trump on January 6, 2021, before a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The resignation of BBC director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness came just days after The Daily Telegraph published details of a leaked internal memo that said a BBC documentary edited Trump’s remarks in a way that it appeared he explicitly encouraged the Capitol insurrection. The BBC is reportedly planning to formally apologize to Trump, who celebrated the resignations saying on Truth Social: “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election…What a terrible thing for Democracy!”

Trump has repeatedly defended unfounded claims that his 2020 loss to Joe Biden was rigged.

And the UN Climate Summit opens today in Belém, Brazil where the United States will be notably absent after the Trump administration declined to send a high-level delegation. The U.S. is still expected to influence the climate talks as Trump officials use lobbyists and economic threats to attempt to sabotage environmental initiatives and efforts to cut emissions proposed by representatives from around the world. The United States is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, while Trump has called the climate crisis a “con job.” Meanwhile, representatives from the Alliance of Small Island States are again urging leaders of the Global North to commit to stronger action in order to prevent the worst impacts of global warming, including the phase-out of fossil fuels. This is Tuvalu’s Environmental Minister speaking in Belém Friday.

Tuvalu’s Environmental Minister Maina Vakafua Talia: “We had high hopes that this new agreement would give us the necessary legal measures to protect Tuvalu from the worst impacts of climate change related sea-level rise. Ten years on from Paris, we are gravely concerned about the slow progress in delivering significant emission reductions to ensure our survival.”

Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?” Since this meeting, the prevalence of aggressive collateral and warrantless ICE arrests has increased drastically, and their impact on communities is widespread.","Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January of this year, the total number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees has increased by over 20,000 people. As of September 2025, there were 59,762 people being held in immigration detention centers nationwide.

Due to such a rapid increase in detainees, detention centers are overcrowded, contributing to inhumane and troubling conditions. Many people have been given spoiled food and non-potable water, had no access to showers or clean clothes and face medical neglect for both physical and mental health concerns.

At least 23 deaths occurred in ICE detention during fiscal year 2025, an increase from 24 deaths in the prior four years combined. Several of these deaths were a result of apparent suicide due to the grueling conditions.

Although Trump and his administration promised to target “the worst of the worst,” 71.5% of those detained have no criminal convictions.

Many people have also been denied due process. The National Immigrant Justice Center states there must be probable cause that an individual is violating immigration laws and that they’re likely to escape before a warrant for arrest can be obtained. The agency’s policies list one of the most significant factors in determining the likelihood of escape is their ties to the community.

If these requirements are not met, the ICE agent is not legally permitted to make a warrantless arrest. Nonetheless, many long-term community members in the Chicago area were arrested without warrant by ICE and Border Patrol in early September during “Operation Midway Blitz.” The operation led to over 3,000 arrests by the end of October, many of these arrests being “collateral arrests” by ICE agents patrolling the streets.

A WBEZ Chicago interview with U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino revealed the collateral arrests in Downtown Chicago are partly based on “how they look.” Bovino has claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the unedited recording of the interview says otherwise.

Rather than seeking individuals who have raised legitimate suspicion of illegal activities, ICE is increasingly concerned with the appearance of arrestees.

While the arrests themselves are unjust, the violent methods used are even more so. In a “60 Minutes” interview with Trump, Norah O’Donnell described agents tackling young mothers, tear gassing in residential areas and smashing car windows during ICE arrests.

When asked if he felt ICE has gone too far with such tactics, Trump boldly states, “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”

It is this rhetoric that led ICE agents to detain pre-K teacher Diana Patricia Satillana Galeano on Nov. 5, following her into her place of work and dragging her out. Parents and children watched as this took place during one of the busiest hours of drop-off, according to Chris Widen, whose 4-month-old son is taught by Galeano.

DHS has disputed this narrative, claiming they attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop prior to arriving at the learning center, and that they did not enter the building.

However, numerous eyewitnesses, including U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, stated the ICE agents entered the facility and went room to room looking for teachers while young children watched. Ramirez and other elected officials are calling for a federal review of the agents’ actions.

The Trump administration pushes the narrative that detainees are dangerous, and that ICE is protecting the “American way of life.” ICE admitted in court that they identify people with pending charges or whose charges were dismissed as criminals, dismissing the right to a fair trial.

Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who served during Trump’s first term as senior advisor and speechwriter, has been one of the most active ICE proponents.

At a meeting between Miller and ICE’s top 50 field agents, Miller “eviscerated” everyone for not detaining more people who aren’t criminals. Miller’s desire to have everyone arrested with or without a basis for arrest is very clear, asking the field agents, “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?”

Since this meeting, the prevalence of aggressive collateral and warrantless ICE arrests has increased drastically, and their impact on communities is widespread.

Miller told Fox News that ICE is looking to arrest at least 3,000 people a day, proudly stating Trump is going to continuously raise that number. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also emphasized the administration’s determination to “aggressively and efficiently” deport undocumented immigrants.

As of April, the University Police Department and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office signed a 287(g) agreement allowing ICE to intervene on UF’s campus. This followed the detainment of UF student Felipe Zapata Velásquez, despite no previous criminal record.

Since then, students have been speaking out for others that can’t speak out for themselves. A recent protest on Nov. 5 shows their continuous effort to protect students and the community.

Regardless of your stance on immigration, needless aggression for the sake of efficiency is unacceptable. This blatant lack of empathy is not just impacting immigrants — it’s impacting entire communities nationwide.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ufa/ef41c3ee-b912-4c7e-b673-acd2368cb3e6.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&dpr=2&ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=faces,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:18.203822

USDA’s latest memo, sent Saturday to state directors of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, instructed states to deliver just 65 percent of benefits during the government shutdown and required those who already sent full payments to claw back that money.

“To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,” the memo notes.

The department threatened to take various actions if states don’t comply, including cancelling federal funds that go toward administrative costs for the program or holding states liable for “overissuances.”

The Saturday memo is the latest in a string of moves from the Trump administration that has altered federal guidance on SNAP on a near daily basis, first directing states to pay partial benefits, then saying USDA would comply with full benefits, then filing an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed late Friday to lift a deadline imposed by a Rhode Island judge, who ordered officials to tap into a separate USDA nutrition account to deliver full SNAP payments this month.

Nearly 42 million Americans rely on the anti-hunger program, which went dark for the first time on Nov. 1 during the record-breaking shutdown.

Several states have rushed to redirect their own funds to support food banks and benefits for families, but the back-and-forth in court has caused significant confusion across the country.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.","More than 99% of the world's 7.7 billion people have one or more of their environmental rights threatened, according to new research.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations' annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

""Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,"" said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Studies. ""We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can't be dismissed as isolated problems.""

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on Earth has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution without borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and 1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

""The numbers are heartbreaking,"" said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

""A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,"" said Mehrabi. ""But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can't play outside.""

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world's population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

""No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,"" Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

""An unstable environment destabilizes our society,"" Mehrabi said. ""There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.""

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don't tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

""There are many solutions to these environmental problems we're facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,"" Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

""By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes. This can be a critical tool for pushing for policy changes,"" Ormaza-Zulueta said.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/billions-live-in-envir.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:03:01.813455

TOP TALKER

TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS: A group of business and civic leaders published an open letter in the Chicago Tribune on Sunday to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration-enforcement actions.

“We are united in opposing these extreme enforcement methods that cause long term harm to our city. While immigration policy is complex and opinions differ, we agree on this: these tactics are not welcome in our city,” they wrote in the full-page ad.

Most of the signatories are familiar names in Democratic circles — Chicago is a Democratic town, after all. Among them: John Atkinson, head of the Illinois Economic Development Corporation and an ally of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Ariel Investments Co-CEO and Democratic donor John Rogers Jr.

But also signing the letter was Craig Duchossois, chair emeritus of the Duchossois Group, which recently secured a $5 billion investment from Blackstone Inc. Duchossois is also a major Republican donor, contributing more than $18 million to GOP candidates and causes in the last election cycle. Duchossois’ daughter, Ashley Joyce, who chairs the family company, also signed the letter in the Tribune. Neither returned our request for comment.

What it means: Duchossois speaking up signals that Democrats aren’t the only ones opposed to tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. We hear other Illinois Republicans in the business community have also, quietly, voiced their concerns to friends within Trump’s circle.

The White House defended its actions, saying, Operation Midway Blitz has taken “dangerous criminal illegals” off Chicago’s streets. “Making Chicago communities safer will create an environment where all businesses can thrive in the long-term and their customers can feel safe. Chicago leaders should’ve never made their city a sanctuary for these dangerous criminal illegals to begin with.” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Playbook.

On Friday, some of those who signed the public letter stood together at a press briefing to express their concern that immigration enforcement is hurting the economy.

“We know the president listens to business leaders,” said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition. “He’s extremely motivated by what the business community has to say.”

Shi said revenues for some businesses have declined by 50 percent. “Immigrants, along with undocumented immigrants, contribute $22 billion in taxes and local spending every year,” Shi said. “They’re not just part of our economy. They drive it.”

And Jack Lavin, CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the ramped up immigration enforcement has “scared people away” from restaurants, cultural events and downtown “the heart of Chicago’s economic engine.” More from ABC 7’s Sarah Schulte

At least for now.

[Read: Immigrant Aid in Orange County Poised to Expand]

On the Prop. 50 election night, city council members voted 3-2 to table proposals for a $100,000 immigrant legal defense fund and a $100,000 rent and food assistance program amid budget concerns as officials are projected to face a $10 million deficit at the end of the decade.

Councilman Nick Dunlap said the city can’t afford to fund the aid programs.

“We’ve got parts of our city where entire neighborhoods are without street lights. We’ve got neighborhoods where the roads and streets are so bad that kids and adults can’t ride their bikes and can’t play without worrying about tripping or hurting their feet,” he said.

Dunlap also said people reached out to him and raised concerns that the aid programs were divisive because of their limited funds.

“It seems extra divisive because if there were additional funds available, they should be going to serve our entire community and not a particular group of our community,” he said.

Council members Ahmad Zahra, who spearheaded the proposals, and Shana Charles were the dissenting votes.

“If fiscal responsibility is the goal then I think we should go and reconsider a lot of votes that we’ve taken in the past,” Zahra said at Tuesday’s meeting.

“Maybe we should reconsider firing our city manager back a few years ago, that cost us to pay two city managers at the same time because we had a nine months severance package.”

Charles called the widespread deportation sweeps a public health emergency and said federal immigration agencies are disregarding the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S, Constitution.

“I hope you find it within your heart to have compassion for our neighbors who are experiencing terrifying persecution because of their skin color or spoken language. This is how we show that our city stands up for human rights and the U.S. Constitution,” she said at Tuesday’s meeting.

Charles said she worries about her own family including her children who are Guatemalan American.

“I would be worried that my kids would say to me, ‘Mom, I’m now ashamed of what you did’ if I said to them, yeah, we have $30 million in the bank, and we’re just going to leave $200,000 of it sitting there instead of doing something real that could help real families,” she said.

“This $200,000 is not going to break us, but it could absolutely do some real good right now.”

The council’s aid fund rejection comes as immigrant advocates warn that the roving deportation sweeps that kicked off in June are ramping up again as food bank leaders warn of a sharp increase in hunger amid the longest government shutdown in history.

According to the USC Equity Research Institute, about 16% of Fullerton residents are undocumented or live with an undocumented family member in a city of roughly 137,000 people.

Fullerton’s Financial Woes

Funding for both programs would have come from the roughly $27 million left in the city’s general fund reserve after officials allocated roughly $3.8 million from that pot of money to balance their budget earlier this year.

Fullerton is also facing a projected $9.3 million deficit next fiscal year that, if left unchecked, could go up to $10 million by the end of the decade, according to the city budget.

Councilwoman Jamie Valencia, who had previously voted to bring back proposals on the immigration aid funds, did not directly speak to why she voted against the proposals this time but asked a couple of questions on the budget.

“We have such a huge deficit that we need for critical infrastructure for our city. That’s what cities focus on,” she said.

“When we brought this two weeks ago to council, my main concern was that I would love city staff to come back to the table and explain, does our city and can our city financially support without getting away from our critical infrastructure bank and to keep our city going?”

The proposed amount for the programs – $200,000 – is less than 1% of the city’s reserves.

Like Valencia, Mayor Fred Jung didn’t speak to his vote directly, but asked about the budget.

Zahra said the programs were about helping residents in need and the amount wouldn’t break the bank.

“This is not going to impact us. We can weather this. It’s a small amount of money,

and these are what reserve funds are for,” Zahra said.

Charles said the city is expected to discuss two separate proposed sales tax increase measures before next year’s November election that could bring in $15 million for infrastructure like road repairs and $15 million for public safety.

Sounding Off on Immigration Aid Funds in Fullerton

Dozens of people came out to speak in favor of the aid funds in Fullerton Tuesday, arguing officials need to step up to protect and support local immigrant families during a time when they are struggling and fear their loved ones being deported.

A majority of Fullerton School Board members, including Vanessa Estrella, Miguel Alvarez and Ruthi Hancett, were among the speakers in favor of the proposals arguing that it was necessary to keep families together.

“Fullerton School District has already lost some of our students when their parents were deported suddenly,” Hancett said.

“Other families are living in constant fear and have restricted their movements because of the risk of being deported, not because they’re criminals, but because of the illegal ways that immigration is being enforced.”

Some of the speakers wore t-shirts with monarch butterflies – a longtime symbol of immigration for the insect’s migration pattern between Mexico and the U.S.

Others wore white.

Aliya Yousufi, senior policy and advocacy manager at the Council on Islamic-American Relations in Anaheim, said the legal aid fund is necessary because immigrants aren’t always guaranteed a public defender.

“Without access to legal representation, many residents, including those who worship, work and study right here in Fullerton, are forced to face the system alone,” she said at Tuesday’s meeting.

“A legal defense fund would ensure that every Fullerton resident, regardless of status, has fair representation and a chance to stay with their family.”

Some of the speakers spoke directly to Councilwoman Valencia saying she represented a predominantly Latino district and urged her to support local families.

Tanya Leon, a resident and program manager with the OC Justice Fund, said without city support Fullerton residents in detention will have no place to turn for help.

“I just don’t see what the point of fixing critical infrastructure is if Fullertonians are no longer here to use it,” Leon said. “Our residents are district four residents. They are being removed. It makes no difference to me if my streets are better, if my neighbors can’t use them.”

Two people on Zoom spoke out against the proposals, arguing private nonprofits should be the ones supporting immigrants, not the taxpayers.

Jack Dean, a Fullerton resident who served on the city’s fiscal sustainability committee, said the city doesn’t have the money and taxpayers shouldn’t fund a partisan cause.

“I would urge you to work with existing organizations to assist undocumented immigrants begin collecting donations,” he said.

“If you truly believe in this cause, all of you in attendance tonight should be among the first to contribute. Let’s use city funds on services and projects that are needed here and that benefit all city taxpayers.”

Another speaker on Zoom who identified himself solely as Tony agreed.

“It’s not the job of the government to help people with legal aid,” he said.

“I’m willing to help them. I mean, everybody that was here tonight, if they all pitched in, we’d probably have $200,000. We don’t need the government to help community members.”

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.
Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

“Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,” said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a postdoctoral researcher in the Better Planet Lab at CU Boulder. “We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can’t be dismissed as isolated problems.”

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on the planet has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution without borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

“The numbers are heartbreaking,” said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars, and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

“A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,” said Mehrabi. “But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can’t play outside.”

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world’s population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

“No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,” Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

“An unstable environment destabilizes our society,” Mehrabi said. “There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.”

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don’t tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

“There are many solutions to these environmental problems we’re facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,” Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

“By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes. This can be a critical tool for pushing for policy changes,” Ormaza-Zulueta said.",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/1ced1b58-b9ce-4992-ac00-e2831fdf48d9/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-11-10 12:03:07.241751

Sample of Portland, Ore., declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.
“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample.
“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample.
“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.
“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.","Human dignity comes “not from government, but from our loving God,” Archbishop Alexander K. Sample of Portland, Ore., declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.

“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample. “They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.”

The archbishop’s statement — posted in both English and Spanish on the archdiocesan website and the archbishop’s social media platforms, along with a video version of the message — follows months of immigration raids and arrests under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the U.S., a group known to be majority Catholic Christians.

“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample. “This is due to the increased ICE activity within our communities, even now in the vicinity of some of our parishes.”

Oregon has become one of several flashpoints for tensions over the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, with regular protests taking place outside the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“I want to assure our Hispanic brothers and sisters that the shepherds of the church in the United States are working diligently to advocate for their humane and respectful treatment. We are doing all that we can to alleviate this suffering,” said Archbishop Sample, who noted he is currently attending the annual U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ fall plenary meeting in Baltimore.

Both Portland, Oregon’s largest city, and the state government have codified their sanctuary status, prohibiting their respective law enforcement personnel from assisting any federal agency with immigration enforcement.

In September, Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the building. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon sued, with U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — temporarily blocking the deployment of the troops in an October order made permanent Nov. 7.

More than 200 individuals residing in Oregon have been detained by ICE officers since Trump took office, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the farmworker advocacy organization PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), during an Oct. 31 press conference in Portland.

Several North Portland public schools have implemented “secure the perimeter” protocols — locking all exterior doors while continuing learning activities — in response to reported ICE activity. On Nov. 6, some 100 community members surrounded César Chávez School an hour ahead of dismissal to watch out for ICE officers during student pickup.

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) — both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

He underscored their moral severity in “Veritatis Splendor” by calling them examples of “intrinsic evil,” explaining that, no matter the motives, these acts are “not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person.”

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80 percent of all of those at risk of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief.

The report found one in six Catholics (18 percent) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to a Pew Research Center data analysis from March 2025, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29 percent) or the children of immigrants (14 percent). But eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58 percent) or are the children of an immigrant (22 percent), while 92 percent of Asian Catholics are either immigrants (78 percent) or are the children of an immigrant (14 percent). Far fewer white Catholics — just 15 percent — share this immigrant experience: only 6 percent were born outside the U.S., with another 9 percent born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent.

“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.

The archbishop assured them he was “deeply concerned over what you are experiencing right now, along with all of your local parish priests. I know this is a great burden for them as well, because they feel helpless to take this cross from you. … Please know that I and your pastors stand with you in solidarity during this difficult time.”

Archbishop Sample also addressed priests “who are caring for people during these difficult times,” promising his “support and prayers.

“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.

“He alone is our hope, and in him alone do we trust. He is with you always and will never abandon you,” said the archbishop. “Place yourselves in his hands.”

Archbishop Sample concluded his message with “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Jesus Christ!”) — the battle cry of the Cristeros, who defied the anti-Catholic, secular government of Mexico during the Cristero War of 1926-1929. The Cristeros’ defiant cry was made famous in particular by Blessed Miguel Pro. The Mexican martyr and Jesuit priest extended his arms in the form of a cross and shouted those words before he was executed by firing squad in 1927.

In 2000, St. John Paul II canonized 25 martyrs from the Cristero War. In 2016, Pope Francis canonized the most recent Cristero martyr, St. José Sánchez del Río, a teenager remembered for repeating “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” many times before his own public martyrdom in 1928.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Senate voted 60-40 on Sunday to move forward toward passing legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire on January 1. The agreement is a step toward ending the government shutdown, but does not guarantee that the health care subsidies will be extended. Mary Clare Jalonick and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

Federal judge Mark L. Wolf warned yesterday of the “existential threat to democracy” posed by the Trump administration, in an essay published in the Atlantic. The essay came two days after an announcement by the Federal District Court for Massachusetts that Wolf was leaving his post. Mattathias Schwartz reports for the New York Times.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told young lawyers on Friday that Justice Department lawyers are “bouncing around this country fighting these activist judges,” adding “we need you, because it is a war, and it’s something we will not win unless we keep on fighting.” Avery Lotz and Andrew Pantazi report for Axios.

Far-right influencers have hinted online that U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Reding Quiñones will pursue charges of a “grand conspiracy” against Trump’s adversaries. The investigation appears to focus in part on a January 2017 intelligence community assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 election, looking particularly at the role played by former CIA director John O. Brennan. Quiñones last week issued more than two dozen subpoenas, according to sources. Glenn Thrush, Alan Feuer, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Department of Agriculture on Saturday told states to only move ahead with partial SNAP payments following the Supreme Court decision on Friday, according to a USDA memo. The memo instructed states to deliver just 65 percent of benefits during the government shutdown. “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,” the memo says. Rachel Shin reports for POLITICO.

Trump has pardoned several allies who backed his efforts to subvert the 2020 election, according to Justice Department Pardon Attorney Ed Martin who shared the documents on Sunday night. The pardons are largely symbolic as none of those who were identified in Martin’s post were charged with federal crimes. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Trump has also approved a pardon for former police officer Michael McMahon who was convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, conspiracy, and interstate stalking of a family living in New Jersey. Kenneth P. Vogel reports for the New York Times.

Ghislaine Maxwell is preparing a commutation application to be reviewed by the Trump administration, according to a document obtained by the House Judiciary Committee Democrats. If approved, Maxwell’s sentence could be significantly reduced. The Supreme Court already rejected Maxwell’s appeal to her conviction; Trump has not ruled out granting her a pardon. Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

Cornell University agreed to pay $30 million to the Trump administration to immediately restore millions in federal funding and settle investigations into Cornell’s response to antisemitic incidents on campus. The school has also agreed to invest $30 million on agricultural and farming technology programs; submit undergraduate admissions data to the administration; and comply with foreign funding reporting requirements. Bianca Quilantan reports for POLITICO.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

A 3-year old child died as a boat, carrying 21 migrants, capsized off Panama’s Caribbean coast on Sunday, according to Panamanian officials. An official confirmed that the boat was not traveling northward to the United States but in the direction of Colombia. This is the second known case of a child drowning this year on this ‘new migrant route,’ whereby individuals are returning to South America since the Trump administration closed the U.S. border. Panamanian officials say that since late September 14,000 people have travelled in small boats along the coast to avoid passing through the Darien Gap. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

Naomi Seibt, a prominent far-right German activist, has applied for political asylum in the United States. Kate Brady and Aaron Wiener report for the Washington Post.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday that it would suspend export controls for a year on five critical minerals needed for the manufacture of certain semi-conductors and explosives. On Friday, the Ministry of Commerce suspended export control regulations on rare earth materials as agreed between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of October. Keith Bradsher reports for the New York Times.

U.S. government officials will not attend this year’s G20 summit in South Africa, Trump said on Friday. “Afrikaners… are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,” Trump posted on Social Media, adding that “no U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.” Faith Wardwell reports for POLITICO.

More than $5 billion worth of U.S. weapon exports to support NATO allies and Ukraine have been delayed by the government shutdown, according to a State Department estimate shared with Axios. “This is actually really harming both our allies and partners and US industry to actually deliver a lot of these critical capabilities overseas,” a senior official said. Stef W. Kight reports.

The United States on Friday opted out of a regular review of its human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Council. AP News reports.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday condemned the COP30 summit as “essentially a hoax,” adding “It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives.” A White House spokesperson said regarding COP30 that “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.” Derek Gatopoulos, Theodora Tongas, and Mauricio Savarese report for AP News.

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

Thailand today threatened to suspend the ceasefire agreement with Cambodia following the explosion of a land mine in the border area that injured two Thai soldiers. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that the “hostility towards our national security has not decreased as we thought it would,” adding that all action under the U.S.-brokered truce agreement will be halted until Thailand’s demands are met. There was no immediate response from the Cambodian government. Jintamas Saksornchai reports for AP News.

Malaysian authorities said today that hundreds of migrants who left western Myanmar about two weeks ago were missing at sea, including dozens who were on a boat that capsized over the weekend. The migrants had initially set off in a wooden boat carrying about 300 people, according to the Langkawi District Police, adding that the passengers were then transferred to two other boats on Thursday. One boat, carrying 70 people, capsized on Saturday. The police have recovered seven bodies and 13 survivors. The other boat, carrying about 230 others, is still missing at the time of writing. Zunaira Saieed and Ashley Ahn report for the New York Times.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and CEO Deborah Turness resigned yesterday following a report in the Telegraph last week that the public broadcaster had misleadingly edited a speech by Trump prior to the Jan 6. Capital riot. The Telegraph leaked a BBC internal memo arguing that a BBC Panorama documentary had juxtaposed Trump’s comments in a way that made it sound as though he had explicitly encouraged the attack. Stephen Castle reports for the New York Times.

The Saudi Arabian government has disclosed at least 320 executions so far this year. According to human rights group Reprieve, two-thirds of the executions this year have been related to drug offenses. In court documents reviewed by the New York Times, some of those facing the death penalty are low-level smugglers who say they were coerced into carrying drugs. Ismaeel Naar and Vivian Nereim report.

A Paris appeal court is considering the request for release of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Nicholas from prison. The ruling is expected this afternoon. The appeal trial is expected to take place in several months, possibly in spring. Vaux-Montagny and Sylvie Corbet report for AP News.

The Serbian Parliament on Friday approved a new law to tear down the former General Staff military complex in Belgrade which was bombed by NATO in 1999 and to replace it with a Trump-branded hotel and apartments. The plans had previously been stalled after Serbian government officials who had endorsed it were charged with fraud. Lara Jakes and Alisa Dogramadzieva report for the New York Times.

Syria carried out nationwide operations targeting Islamic State cells, which involved 61 raids and 71 arrests, a Syrian Interior Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday. Timour Azhari reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, Gaza health officials said on Saturday. The death toll includes bodies recovered from the rubble in Gaza and Palestinians killed by the Israeli army since the ceasefire began on October 10. Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians on Saturday who approached troops, the Israeli army said in a statement. Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, a day after Hamas returned the remains of the deceased hostage, Lior Rudaeff. Wafaa Shurafa, Sally Abou Aljoud, and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

The U.S.-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre in southern Israel replaced Israel as the overseer of humanitarian aid to Gaza on Friday, but the Israelis are still “part of the conversation,” a U.S. official said. The United States has not yet said which of the Israeli restrictions on aid might be lifted or how the CMCC plans to manage aid operations. A statement from COGAT, the unit within the IDF responsible for facilitating aid to Gaza, said that while “the Americans will take the lead…It should be emphasized that this does not constitute a transfer of authority or responsibility from COGAT.” Karen DeYoung, Claire Parker, Alex Horton, and Cate Brown report for the Washington Post.

The World Bank supports the U.S.-drafted U.N Security Council resolution on Gaza that would authorize a two-year mandate for a ‘Board of Peace’ transitional governance administration, according to a letter, dated Saturday, seen by Reuters. Michelle Nichols reports.

Hamas fighters in Rafah, within the Israeli-controlled area of Gaza, will not surrender to Israel, Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades said yesterday, adding that “the enemy must know that the concept of surrender and handing oneself over does not exist in the dictionary of the Al-Qassam Brigades.” Hamas did not comment directly on continuing U.S.-led talks over the fighters in Rafah. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

The Biden administration last year gathered intelligence that Israeli military lawyers were concerned about the legality of the tactics being used by Israel’s army in the war in Gaza, which could support charges of war crimes against Israel, according to five former U.S. officials. The intelligence prompted an interagency meeting at the National Security Council in late 2024 where officials and lawyers debated how to respond. Three former officials said that U.S.-lawyers concluded that it was still legal for the U.S. to continue supporting Israel with weapons and intelligence because the U.S. had not gathered its own evidence that Israel was violating the law of armed conflict. Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay, and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday that Israeli settlers carried out at least 264 attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in October. OCHA added that this amounts to an average of eight incidents per day and marks the biggest monthly total since the U.N. began tracking such incidents in 2006. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Donald Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil, following a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House on Friday. Hungary also agreed to buy liquefied natural gas from the United States, according to a State Department fact sheet. Erica L. Green reports for the New York Times.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

Last week, the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the United States, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The Sudanese government’s ambassador to South Africa said on Friday it was too early for his country to agree to the plan, adding “we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from the [RSF].” Residents in Khartoum told AFP News Agency that they heard the sounds of drones and explosions early on Friday morning. Barbara Plett Usher and Mayeni Jones report for BBC News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily halted a lower court order that would have required the Trump administration to fund SNAP payments in full. Tony Romm and Abbie VanSickle report for the New York Times.

A federal appeals court on Sunday night declined to block an order from a district court judge requiring the Trump administration from paying SNAP payments in full for November. The ruling is on hold due to an earlier order from the Supreme Court on Friday. Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority when he sought to deploy the National Guard troops to Portland for the stated purpose of protecting the ICE office, issuing a permanent block on troop deployment. Anna Griffin reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Education Department had violated the First Amendment rights of furloughed workers by using their work email accounts to send partisan messages blaming Democratic lawmakers for the government shutdown. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.

,Litigation,2025-11-10 13:15:03+00:00,The Denver Post,Supreme Court to hear arguments in Aurora detention center lawsuit - The Denver Post,Seth Klamann,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/11/10/supreme-court-colorado-case-detention-center-geo/,"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in a class-action lawsuit against Aurora’s immigration detention center, considering a legal question in the more-than-decade-old case that accuses the facility of enacting a system of forced labor.
That’s the question that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider: whether Geo can appeal now.
The Geo Group has filed multiple appeals — including an earlier request to the Supreme Court that was rejected.
The state Supreme Court and a federal appellate court both sided with the detainees.
In an earnings call Thursday, George Zoley, the executive chairman of Geo’s board, said the company had also appealed that decision to the U.S Supreme Court.","The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in a class-action lawsuit against Aurora’s immigration detention center, considering a legal question in the more-than-decade-old case that accuses the facility of enacting a system of forced labor.

Filed on behalf of nine now-former detainees, the 2014 lawsuit accuses the private prison company that runs the facility of forcing random detainees to clean parts of the facility for free. If they refused, the lawsuit alleges, detainees — meaning immigrants without proper legal status — faced solitary confinement.

But the high court’s justices aren’t set to weigh in on the primary allegations in the suit when they convene Monday morning. Instead, they’ll consider a denser legal question. The company that owns the facility, the Geo Group, has tried to argue that it has immunity from the litigation as a government contractor. But a federal judge rejected that defense.

Geo then appealed, but in late 2024, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — the federal appellate court overseeing Colorado — declined to overturn the lower court’s ruling. Its judges wrote that Geo couldn’t appeal the ruling while the broader lawsuit was still underway.

That’s the question that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider: whether Geo can appeal now.

The Geo Group asked the high court to intervene earlier this year, citing conflicting rulings from judges across the country on similar questions. If the Supreme Court sides with the company, the justices then would likely tell the 10th Circuit’s judges to circle back to the immunity question and decide if Geo can argue that it’s innoculated against facing the allegations.

Though complex, Monday’s arguments represent the latest incremental step in an 11-year-old legal saga. So old is the case that four of the Supreme Court’s current justices hadn’t been appointed when it was filed. Nearly 40 attorneys have filed to represent one party or another while the case has been pending. The Geo Group has filed multiple appeals — including an earlier request to the Supreme Court that was rejected.

“We’re looking forward to the opportunity to argue before the Supreme Court,” said David Seligman, a Denver attorney who is one of the lawyers representing detainees. “This case has been going on since 2014, and we and our clients are deeply frustrated by Geo’s efforts to continue delaying this litigation. All we want is the opportunity to have our claims vindicated in court.”

The Geo Group did not respond to an email seeking comment late last week, but its attorneys wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court: “The Tenth Circuit’s decision is the latest addition to a deep division in the circuit courts as to whether a denial of derivative sovereign immunity is an appealable collateral order.”

The Trump administration has asked to participate in the Supreme Court case and will argue on the same side as the detainees’ attorneys, against Geo’s appeal claims.

Immigration policy — and its enforcement — has undergone radical shifts in the country during the course of the litigation. Amid President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation efforts, the Aurora facility’s capacity has expanded to its full potential of more than 1,500 detainees. The Trump administration is also planning to expand its capacity in the state by reopening a private prison northeast of Denver for immigration detention. That facility was previously operated by Geo.

The work policy that the lawsuit challenges is still in place, said Andrea Loya, the executive director of Casa De Paz, a nonprofit group that works with detainees and their families.

“Unfortunately, that is still the same,” she said, adding that some current detainees protested the policy earlier this year.

According to the lawsuit and subsequent legal filings, officers in the Aurora facility have randomly selected six detainees from each of its housing pods every day. Those people have been required to clean the entire pod. If they repeatedly refuse, they “face a range of possible sanctions, including disciplinary transfer, solitary confinement for up to seventy-two hours, suspension of privileges, reprimand, and warning,” Chief Judge Jerome A. Holmes wrote in the 10th Circuit’s ruling last year.

When the case was first filed, the detainees’ lawyers also challenged Geo’s voluntary work program, in which detainees cook, clean, do laundry and maintain the facility’s landscaping for $1 a day. The attorneys argued that the practice violated minimum wage laws.

But U.S. District Court Judge John L. Kane rejected that claim, finding that the detainees weren’t employees and that Geo wasn’t their employer.

Other courts have ruled otherwise. In a separate lawsuit filed in Washington state against another Geo-run immigration detention center, a jury awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages to detainees who participated in the voluntary work program, and a judge added nearly $6 million more in penalties, according to the Washington State Standard. The state Supreme Court and a federal appellate court both sided with the detainees.

In an earnings call Thursday, George Zoley, the executive chairman of Geo’s board, said the company had also appealed that decision to the U.S Supreme Court.

“No company has ever paid state minimum wages to individuals working in confinement facilities,” he said.

Universal healthcare has been a rallying call of rank-and-file workers — healthcare workers among them — for years.","Twelve days into the government shutdown, Vice President JD Vance threatened federal workers that they would feel the pain if Democrats did not agree to Republicans’ plan: “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be. To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.” Beneath his usual grimace of performative empathy, Vance exposed the callous truth of this face off between the Democratic Party and Trump’s GOP: workers’ lives are nothing but a bargaining chip for the two imperialist parties.

Left out in the cold by the Democrats and Republicans, the working class and poor are left to sort it out for ourselves. All workers, public sector and private alike, must demand that our unions take the side — not of the representatives of the bosses — but of the workers and oppressed, using their might to force an end to the shutdown, an end to layoffs and full backpay for all those furloughed, full employment and a living wage for all to feed their families, universal healthcare, and an independent, combative plan of action to fight all of Trump’s attacks on the working class.

Trump Is on the Offense Against Workers

Over a month into the longest government shutdown in history, over 700 thousand federal workers have been furloughed without pay since September; another 700 thousand workers deemed “essential” are working without pay. Though the courts have intervened to block permanent layoffs for now, the Trump administration continues to set its sights on cutting the federal workforce, especially in the departments of Education, Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The administration is again signaling that it intends to refuse backpay for workers furloughed during the shutdown, flouting a 2019 law that is meant to ensure workers are paid back after a shutdown.

42 million people have not received their SNAP benefits, as tens of thousands of federal workers flock to food pantries and rely on mutual aid to feed their families. Of course banks have been quick to profit off of working people’s hardship, offering short-term loans to workers unable to pay their bills and without the savings to make it through the shutdown.

Flights across the country are being disrupted as airport workers are forced to continue working with severe staffing shortages. Behind the disruption in service and dangerous chaos at airports are the over 11,000 air traffic controllers and other workers who are being forced to work without pay. Many of them are faced with the choice of not showing up to work (risking their jobs), or being exhausted by working additional hours at other jobs just to make ends meet.

The shutdown has been the perfect opportunity for the Trump administration to continue its mission of cutting the federal workforce, forcing hundreds of thousands of people out of their jobs in a second wave of cuts since Elon Musk departed from DOGE. According to some estimations, around two hundred thousand jobs had been cut in the federal administration as of September 23. Those targeted for layoffs during the shutdown show that Trump is not concerned about making the government more “efficient,” but in advancing its chainsaw agenda, dissolving the remaining frayed threads of America’s social safety net and consolidating executive power to attack his enemies.

After all, the shutdown itself is the Democrats’ response to Trump’s attempts to eradicate the limited provisions of Obamacare. The funding package put forward by the Republican Party would send health insurance premiums skyrocketing, effectively cutting off the 24 million people who do not get insurance from a job from access to healthcare. It would also keep in place the cuts to healthcare programs for working and poor people established in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

The Right is using the shutdown to punish its enemies while rewarding its allies. While the administration throws up its hands and once again claims there’s no money to pay federal workers or deliver SNAP benefits, it continues to pay politicians, as well as the military, ICE, and police. Trump enlisted billionaire Timothy Mellon to donate $130 million to the government to pay the military; the administration dipped into emergency funding to continue to pay ICE. And military deployments to the border continue apace to make sure no squabble in Congress affects Trump’s xenophobic war on immigrants. These extraordinary measures are of course due to the essential role these agents play in enforcing Trump’s agenda both domestically in the form of internal repression of immigrants and dissent, and internationally in the form of increasingly aggressive military and federal intervention at the U.S. border and in Venezuela and Latin America.

And as millions more people and families across the country face the fact that they don’t know where their next meal is going to come from, Trump is showing just who he represents. While Trump claims to be on the side of working people, his administration is threatening to starve workers and their families in order to make further cuts to social programs. Of course there is all the money in the world for Gatsby-themed Halloween parties for the ultra-wealthy and political elite, all the money in the world for a corrupt endeavor to construct a vanity wing of the White House with billionaire money in exchange for settled lawsuits.

So far the administration has been able to weather the storm of the shutdown. While federal courts were quick to intervene to cling to some semblance of stability as approval ratings for the government plummet and the capitalists gripe about lost profits, the Supreme Court once again ruled in Trump’s favor on the question of withholding SNAP benefits. It seems likely that the Democratic Party will cave and vote for Trump and the GOP’s funding bill to end the shutdown and stop the potential fallout from a shutdown that proves just how precarious most working-class people are in the richest country in the world.

Nevertheless there are signs that the shutdown may be accelerating anti-Trump sentiment, putting him in a weaker position. Despite divisions in the GOP over healthcare, the fact that the GOP is refusing to cede any ground to Democrats — no matter how much it takes a toll on the administration’s approval ratings — shows that this is Trump’s party through and through. Now Republicans are seeing that this comes at a cost, especially after the rebuke that Trump received at the polls in the most recent national elections and in the streets during the No Kings protest in October.

Democrats Are Mobilizing for the Next Election, Not to Protect Workers

The Democrats refused to fund the government supposedly in an attempt to protect healthcare for millions of working-class people in the United States and stand up to Trump. But this too-little, too-late maneuver is nothing but a play to capitalize on a narrow part of the most unpopular of Trump’s proposals to boost their own decrepit image and improve their chances in the 2026 elections.

The fact that they were ready to cave to the Republicans and accept a year-long extension of healthcare subsidies shows that this was never about ensuring that working people have access to medical care. Now that they have been the beneficiaries of anti-Trump sentiment during November’s elections, the Democrats are seeing this as a moment to project strength. As Senator Bernie Sanders said, Democrats “have got to remain strong” on extending Obamacare provisions, including “a commitment from the speaker of the House that he will support the legislation, and that the president will sign.” But while Democrats remain strong up on Capitol Hill, working people below are suffering each day that the shutdown continues.

But the shutdown is only useful to them until it starts to hurt their approval ratings. And despite their success in the elections, the Democratic Party remains deeply divided even on the question of just how much to stand up to Trump. It is likely that the right-wing of the party will cave without getting anything in return, while the progressive wing is betting that taking a stand now will improve Democrats’ standing in the view of the public. But this political oscillation between two dead end strategies makes clear that the Democrats will not be the ones to stand up to Trump. Until now, they have played by the rules, allowing Trump to move ahead with every single one of his attacks on working people, trans people, people of color, and immigrants. Democrats did not shut down the government to protest Trump’s rampant authoritarianism or attacks on immigrants and working people, but instead chose a safe political battle to score points against republicans toward the midterm elections. Ultimately the shutdown is part of a policy of normalizing Trump’s attacks on democratic rights, including attacks on workers rights and the right to protest.

The Democrats will not be the ones to stand up against Trump’s policies. In fact, they stand in the way of the working class and oppressed, uniting to fight back. Ultimately they have more in common with Trump and the Republicans than they have differences. That’s been true of their support for Genocide in Palestine and war in the Middle East, deportation of immigrants, and economic exploitation of billions of working people across the world. They will end the shutdown on their terms, not in the interests of the working class.

Workers Can Unite to End These Attacks. Unions Need to Take the Lead, Not Bow to Either Party of Capital

The Democrats and Republicans are weaponizing — often and publicly — the suffering of our class during the shutdown. They claim to act in our interest, but this shutdown is about nothing other than their own political jockeying. They may end the shutdown, but this does not repair the damage done to working people or prepare them for the hardships to come after Trump and the GOP’s cuts to social services and what limited government healthcare programs still exist.

The only ones shouldering the burden of this shutdown — even after it ends — are working and poor people. A continuing shutdown means further economic hardship; accepting Republicans’ funding bill means further economic hardship. Workers need to find their own solution, uniting across sectors and organized and unorganized workers to demand better living conditions and an end to Trump’s attacks without anchoring their struggle to either party.

That means a fight by rank-and-file workers with the leaders of the labor movement to carve an independent path. Union leaders have entered the fray of the government shutdown, only to take the side of Republicans or Democrats. Federal workers unions were initially supportive of Democrats’ move to refuse to approve the government funding bill, ready to put up this fight for the entire working class to have access to healthcare. Now as they feel the burden of the shutdown, it’s becoming clear that no politician is coming to save them, including their leaders tied to the Democrats. Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, has called on Republicans to cede to Democrats’ demands and “extend the subsidies and open the government.” Throwing their lot in with the Democratic Party, they tie the futures of working-class people to a losing strategy that will not guarantee anyone healthcare.

Meanwhile, Teamsters president Sean O’Brien continues to throw his support behind Trump. He appeared alongside union leaders and bosses alike in a video for the White House denouncing the shutdown. O’Brien called on Democrats “to make the deal they should have made a long time ago” — a deal that would cut benefits for workers across the country without a real plan to fight to win healthcare and higher wages.

This is not a union leader doing everything in their power to end a shutdown that is harmful to workers; this is a bureaucrat vying for a better seat at the table to negotiate the terms of exploitation for the workers he represents, tying workers’ futures to the political power of a far-right politician who has done nothing in his second term other than fire workers, attack immigrant and Black and Brown workers, and give benefit after benefit to the capitalists and ultra-wealthy. O’Brien is stepping aside to let Trump go on the offense against workers.

The labor movement must organize across the country to demand that their unions mobilize so that workers do not pay the price of this government shutdown or Trump’s attacks. This must go beyond federal workers’ unions to include all organized workers. Millions of workers rely on Medicare and food stamps — this is their fight too; but millions more still struggle to access healthcare. Universal healthcare has been a rallying call of rank-and-file workers — healthcare workers among them — for years. This cannot be a fight to simply extend a healthcare system that doesn’t work, to fight for the devil we know; rather it presents an opportunity to build an independent fight to win universal healthcare for all. We need high quality, state-funded universal health care for everyone living in the country that can’t be taken or negotiated away by the two parties of capital.

But the force to win these kinds of demands is built by uniting the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the Trump administration. From the No Kings march to Trump’s beating in the elections and the resistance to his immigration agenda in Chicago, its clear that there exists deep discontent with Trump and his policies — policies that are not only denying basic rights to immigrants, but also increasing the cost of living and making life harsher for people of color, women, the LGBTQI+ community and all exploited and oppressed people in the United States.

To stop Trump we need working class independence. Labor must join the fight, as did workers in Italy and the Spanish State to demand an end to the genocide in Gaza. Rather than waiting for the Democrats and Republicans to end the shutdown, the labor movement and social movements need to organize the fightback. That means working people taking to the streets, shutting down their workplaces and schools until social services are re-established and every single worker is rehired with full backpay. But it can’t stop there. The Democrats and Republicans are likely to pass this latest funding bill, one that spells disaster for working people. We must unite our struggles to fight for full employment and a living wage for all people regardless of their immigration status, and an independent, combative plan of action to fight all of Trump’s attacks on the working class. This must be united with the struggles against ICE and the National Guard, against the genocide in Gaza, and against Trump’s repressive and Bonapartist policies and his occupations of major cities.",https://www.leftvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aedb15ec7b8d9057f76beda942cf0b3df299802a-1500x1000-1-e1762736817407.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:02:50.454404

Whether it’s more because of his economic or immigration policies, the fact is that Trump has been bad news for Latino workers.
Once in office, his dumbfounding policies have instead stalled hiring, including prominently in the industries most populated by Latino workers.","Because of historic discrimination and language barriers, Latino workers are more heavily represented in certain industries than in others. Those industries — which include construction, healthcare and hospitality — are also ones that have seen a dramatic slump in hiring in the early Trump administration compared to the last year of Joe Biden’s term.

That’s the finding of a recent report from my organization, Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), which has been taking a closer look at the impact of tax and other fiscal policies on the nation’s Latino community.

ATF estimated in another report last May, for example, that Latino workers would on average lose around $1,500 in 2026 from the combination of Republican tax and service cuts, plus the impact of President Trump’s erratic tariffs.

Our more recent report found that nearly 300,000 net fewer jobs were created in Latino-heavy industries in the first eight months of 2025 — under Trump — than in the first eight months of 2024, under Biden. That steep falloff in hiring included 76,000 fewer new jobs created in transportation and warehousing, 100,000 fewer in private education and health services, and 115,000 fewer in construction.

Businesses are naturally cautious to expand employment amidst the chaos of the Trump administration, which includes a record-long government shutdown, a huge increase in public debt, and an inscrutable tariff policy. And a lot of the kinds of jobs Latino workers are more likely to seek — especially in construction — are the first to disappear in an economic slowdown.

Not considered in the ATF report — since it’s outside our sphere of economics — is another crucial factor in the slowed growth of jobs traditionally and disproportionately held by Latino workers: the Trump administration’s harsh crackdown on immigration. But other reports have found a link.

A study conducted by a California university showed that increased immigration enforcement correlates with a decline in Latino employment in that state — which given its heavy Latino population and the focus it has received from ICE seems like a reasonable proxy for many parts of the country. This report found that over 360,000 fewer Latinos Californians were on the job between May and June of this year, a drop that corresponds to heightened immigration enforcement activity in the state.

A paper published in August noted a decline nationally in employment in agriculture, construction and hospitality — three of the Latino-intensive industries we note in our report — and blamed those losses on Trump’s aggressive deportations.

Whether it’s more because of his economic or immigration policies, the fact is that Trump has been bad news for Latino workers. And few Latinos occupy the rarified income levels that have been most helped by the presidential agenda.

The millions of Latinos making less than $53,000 will actually see their costs increasenext year thanks to GOP fiscal policies. To come out ahead next year after the combination of Republican tax cuts and healthcare-cost increases (caused by the GOP’s refusal to extend ACA premium subsidies), families have to be at least in the middle-income range of $53,000 to $91,000. But those folks on average get only about a dollar a day — a dollar easily swallowed by Trump tariff price hikes.

The real money will flow to those with higher incomes. Households with incomes between roughly $360,000 and $920,000 will pocket a net $5,000 or so on average next year. Households with income of about a million dollars and more will on average net out a $28,000 tax-cut bonanza — with those at the very top sopping up the most gravy per household.

Trump campaigned on creating a strong economy and bringing down costs for average Americans, including Latino families. Once in office, his dumbfounding policies have instead stalled hiring, including prominently in the industries most populated by Latino workers. His harsh immigration policies have made the general economic malaise even worse for Latinos. And his tax-and-spending agenda promises to raise costs for the lowest income 40 percent of households, where almost half of all Latino families can be found.

Polling shows Latino voters, who demonstrated a shift towards the Republican party in 2024, are shifting back towards the Democrats, a phenomenon demonstrated in the recent off-year elections. That makes sense since Donald Trump has delivered the opposite of what he promised.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cp-default-share.png,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:51.220275

While Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of using the government shutdown as leverage to ensure health care access for unauthorized immigrants, such immigrants were never eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.
Connecticut’s state-run Obamacare exchange, for example, is among those that ramped up in-person outreach to immigrants, according to its CEO, James Michel.
While the U.S. has long imposed restrictions on immigrants considered a burden on taxpayers, the Trump administration was the first to designate public health insurance as a form of welfare.
“When you take health care away from one person in a family, the rest of the family is less likely to get the care they need even if they still qualify,” said Cadena.","Democrats, who are preoccupied with getting an extension of the enhanced subsidies, say it will be hard to undo measures in the megabill.

“Once we get the government open maybe we can get them to negotiate on that, but I am not optimistic,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) on Friday.

Immigration advocates worry that the impact of the loss is being underestimated and predict that entire families could lose access, including U.S. citizen spouses and children. The policy could also raise insurance prices for everyone, said Arturo Bustamante, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, since immigrants tend to be younger and use fewer health services than the general population.

“This could potentially trigger some local markets to go into death spirals,” said Bustamante, who focuses on the health impacts of immigration policy. “If you only keep unhealthy people insured, who are expected to have high utilization of services, that essentially makes insurance really expensive.”

The 2010 Affordable Care Act offered insurance subsidies in the form of tax credits to lawfully-present immigrants who earned less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level — roughly $15,000 a year. The policy made it easier for green card holders, asylum seekers and refugees to qualify — some of whom are barred by law from Medicaid coverage for at least 5 years after arriving in the U.S.

The Obamacare tax credits, meant to fill this gap in coverage, will disappear starting next year due to a provision in Republicans’ One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. And in 2027, lawfully-present immigrants who earn more than 100 percent of the poverty level will lose discounted Obamacare rates available to citizens, based on income.

While Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of using the government shutdown as leverage to ensure health care access for unauthorized immigrants, such immigrants were never eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.

State action

States and advocacy groups are scrambling to warn immigrants about the impending change and get the word out about their options.

Connecticut’s state-run Obamacare exchange, for example, is among those that ramped up in-person outreach to immigrants, according to its CEO, James Michel.

Advocates are stressing immigrants need to pay attention to the fine print of this open enrollment, which kicked off on Saturday for most states.

“They need to make sure they accurately represent their income, particularly if their income might be higher than the poverty line this year [because] that would make them eligible for tax credits,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior strategist for the National Immigration Law Center.

Some states have stepped in to provide Medicaid coverage for immigrants who don’t qualify yet for the program.

The 2009 Immigrant Children’s Health Improvement Act allows states to waive the five-year waiting period for children and pregnant women. As of April 2025, 37 states and the District of Columbia have taken up this option for children and another 31 for pregnant women, according to an analysis from the health policy research group KFF.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia offer coverage for children regardless of their immigration status, including unauthorized immigrants, but these states have to use their own funds to pay for it. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.

Since September 2025 seven states — Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California — have offered Medicaid to anyone whose income qualifies regardless of immigration status. However, California, Minnesota and Illinois are scaling back their programs due to budget concerns, according to KFF.

Uncertain fate

Lawfully-present immigrants are bracing for an additional blow to their health care access: the expected revival of the so-called “public charge rule” from Trump’s first administration — which could penalize immigrants who take advantage of the health insurance programs they remain legally entitled to.

The Department of Homeland Security sent a draft proposal of the regulation to the White House on Monday — typically the final step before it is published for public comment.

The previous version of the policy, which the Biden administration stopped enforcing in 2021 and scrapped in 2022, empowered the government to deny immigrants’ applications for permanent resident status if they had received or were expected to receive food or housing assistance, Medicaid, or other public benefits. While the U.S. has long imposed restrictions on immigrants considered a burden on taxpayers, the Trump administration was the first to designate public health insurance as a form of welfare.

The scope of the new version of the rule is not yet known — which immigrants it will apply to and what kinds of benefits will be implicated — but data has emerged about the impact of the previous iteration that has alarmed advocates for immigrants.

“The public charge rule intensified a lot of people’s existing fears of accessing public benefits,” said Adriana Cadena, executive director of the advocacy group Protecting Immigrant Families. “Bringing it back now would only compound that effect, since there’s already a target on immigrants’ backs, and further erode their trust in government.”

A 2021 study found that the rule led many low-income immigrants to avoid using health services, including more than a quarter of legal permanent residents, who were not subject to the rule. The chilling effect began years before the policy took effect, fueled by rhetoric from federal government officials, the UCLA researchers found, and continued for more than a year after President Joe Biden got rid of the rule.

“When you take health care away from one person in a family, the rest of the family is less likely to get the care they need even if they still qualify,” said Cadena.

Bustamante predicted, based on this and other research, that both a revived public charge rule and the loss of ACA subsidies for legal immigrants will have spillover effects for the entire population. For instance, he said, the policies could burden already stressed hospitals if immigrants without health insurance skip preventive care and end up in the emergency room, and they could make it harder to control outbreaks of infectious diseases by deterring immigrants from seeking testing and treatment.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F09%2Fba%2Fcffa5af94e3197edc8bd9574b64b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2223600329,N,,2025-11-10 08:00:48.240185

During a one-day mission to Budapest on 22 October 2025, partner organisations of the Platform met with journalists, media representatives, legal experts, and representatives of civil society to discuss key issues affecting media freedom, rule of law and free expression. Stakeholders described a severely restricted media environment within which independent journalism operates, while also highlighting the deep political polarisation shaping the run-up to the expected April 2026 elections.

In the past year, the ruling party Fidesz has maintained the most sophisticated system of media capture and control yet seen within the European Union, constructed through sustained dominance over public media, continued consolidation of private outlets under allied ownership, and persistent distortion of the market through control over state advertising, with severe consequences for media pluralism and independent journalism.

While online harassment against independent media has long been documented in Hungary, including campaigns aimed at representatives of the Platform partners, the polarised and divisive nature of the election campaign has increased the severity and nature of the threats. Multiple stakeholders reported targeted harassment and smear campaigns directed at independent journalists and outlets by representatives and supporters of the two most prominent parties and media outlets deemed friendly to the ruling party, many of which are owned by the government-linked KESMA foundation. The partners were alarmed by reports that journalists have been smeared online and in the media as being affiliated with opposing political parties in an attempt to discredit them as trusted and independent sources of public interest information.

The partners also sought to assess the impact that the draft bill on the Transparency in Public Life had on the work of journalists, media outlets, and civil society. If passed, it would have allowed for the blacklisting, financial restriction and potential closure of media outlets receiving foreign funds, having a deeply chilling effect on media. For those able to remain open, they may be forced into exile to be able to continue reporting. The mission heard that the bill remains shelved, with no current indication Fidesz plans to reintroduce it ahead of the 2026 election.

However, the ruling party’s two-thirds parliamentary majority and recent extension of the state of emergency mean the bill could be passed immediately, without public consultation. Many representatives spoke of the uncertainty this proposed bill caused, as well as the resources expended by many to establish contingency plans to ensure they can continue their vital work. With its reintroduction still a possibility, the bill continues to pose an existential threat to what remains of Hungary’s free press.

The Platform further notes that although the foreign funding bill was withdrawn, the Sovereignty Protection Office (SPO), the government office that would be charged with overseeing the proposed law, has spearheaded the attempted delegitimisation of media that receive any form of foreign funding or grant, portraying them as foreign agents and traitors. The SPO’s reports have fed wider online harassment and hate against journalists working for these titles online and on social media, including referring to independent journalists as ‘political pressure groups’. The SPO has also supported campaigns led by the ruling Fidesz party to target journalists and civil society, such as the smearing of leading independent outlets and non-governmental organisations.

The Platform’s partners are also concerned about the rise of legal harassment directed at journalists and media outlets, including abusive claims based on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or press correction procedures. While we support processes to hold journalists to account and ensure inaccuracies are addressed, we are concerned by reports that this process has been used to target factual if critical reporting. With the capture of Hungary’s courts by the ruling party a persistent issue, such legal harassment can have a disproportionate impact on public interest reporting.

Hungarian authorities have not made any progress in aligning domestic law with the EU’s European Media Freedom Act (EMFA) since its full entry to effect in August 2025. Those we met confirmed the absence of any engagement with media outlets or civil society towards this goal. Instead, the Hungarian government has presented the regulation as an authoritarian dictat from Brussels and has challenged the EMFA before the European Court of Justice, seeking to have it nullified.

Following revelations about the abuse of journalists using zero-click Pegasus spyware carried out by Hungarian intelligence services in 2021, prosecutors’ initial investigations failed to provide answers and, to date, no individual or authority has been held responsible for these attacks on journalistic privacy and source protection. Unjustified national security justifications have been used to shield the responsible state institutions from accountability, resulting in a state of impunity.

Beyond such surveillance, the partners also discussed the threat of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, a form of digital censorship that left the websites of more than 40 different media offline for several hours after a spate of attacks in recent years. Although police arrested an individual they claim is responsible earlier this year, it is unclear when the person will face trial and questions remain over whether the cyber-attacks were carried out with external coordination and resources.

The Platform partners note that after the mission ended, the Hungarian portfolio of Ringier, a Swiss media company, which includes the most popular tabloid, Blikk, was purchased by Indamedia, a pro-government media group. The acquisition, made ahead of next year’s election, is yet another example of the consolidation of media under ownership of private business interests close to the government and looks likely to further erode media pluralism in Hungary ahead of the vote.

Despite severe pressures on media freedom, quality and independent journalism continues to exist in Hungary and a cohort of outlets maintain a strong commitment to fact-based, public interest reporting. This is reinforced by high-levels of public support, which has translated to significant subscription funding and solidarity when an outlet is targeted. However, these outlets continue to face sustained economic, political, and legal challenges and their foothold remains extremely fragile.

The platform delegation included representatives from the Platform secretariat, ARTICLE 19, Committee to Protect Journalists, European Broadcasting Union, European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, European Federation of Journalists, Index on Censorship, International Federation of Journalists, International Press Institute, and Reporters Without Borders.

Prior to the commencement of the mission, partners reached out to organise meetings with the Prime Minister and the SPO. On behalf of the Prime Minister, Zoltan Kovacs confirmed that he was unavailable to meet due to prior commitments, while the partners never received a response from the SPO.

Dick Durbin,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-chicago-raid-trump-durbin-rcna242614,"Masked, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, federal immigration agents stormed into Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago on Wednesday at 7 a.m.
But in the meantime, under the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s direction, federal agents have conducted ruthless immigration raids across Chicago.
But excessive militarized ICE raids and misuse of the military for immigration enforcement and domestic policing will not make Chicago safer.
I’ve spoken with protestors, just a few of the hundreds of people who have rallied together outside of the ICE facility to push back against federal agents’ actions.
Another ordered federal agents not to indiscriminately deploy tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on peaceful protestors, journalists and clergy.","Masked, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, federal immigration agents stormed into Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago on Wednesday at 7 a.m. Without presenting a warrant, the agents dragged teacher Diana Galeano out from the day care’s vestibule. Despite her pleas of “I have papers,” urgently delivered in English and Spanish, the agents carted the teacher away as terrified children inside hid and parents outside filmed the arrest.

The arrest of Galeano, who has a valid work permit, is just the latest in a string of reports about the chilling, cruel and chaotic actions by Department of Homeland Security officers in Illinois.

Mr. President: Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles are not “the enemy.”

Thriving on the fear he is cultivating across the country he is supposed to be leading, President Donald Trump has unleashed militarized law enforcement onto the streets of Chicago. There, according to eyewitnesses and local reports, federal officers have zip-tied children, attacked clergymen with tear gas, tackled reporters doing their jobs and temporarily disappeared people based on their ethnicity and regardless of their immigration status.

On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he would be a “dictator” on day one. He has taken the unprecedented, unnecessary and unlawful step of turning the military on American cities to attack what he calls, the “enemy within.”

Mr. President: Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles are not “the enemy.”

Let’s call this what it is: political theater.

Wanting to play a strongman on TV, the president manufactured a crisis. He claimed Chicago needed to be “saved” and tried to deploy 500 members of the National Guard to the city, in a dangerous escalation of tensions he himself created.

That deployment is on hold, thanks to a federal judge’s order that the Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, under the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s direction, federal agents have conducted ruthless immigration raids across Chicago. They have forcefully arrested anyone — even the elderly, women and terrified children — that they suspect of being an immigrant.

And outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois — where many detainees are being held — federal agents have met peaceful protestors, journalists and even local law enforcement with excessive force.

My constituents live in constant fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions.

I have always supported bipartisan, evidence-based ways to reduce violent crime. But excessive militarized ICE raids and misuse of the military for immigration enforcement and domestic policing will not make Chicago safer. The administration’s expansive use of the military across the country to support immigration enforcement activities is a dangerous distraction that hurts military readiness, pulls our Guardsmen and women away from home and wastes precious taxpayer dollars to the tune of up to $2 billion by the end of the year, per Pentagon estimates.

Rather than earnestly addressing crime, the Trump administration has hindered crime control efforts by Illinois leaders and slashed funding for crime prevention programs.

This was never about reducing crime. If it was, President Trump would have bolstered support for crime prevention programs, not cut them to the bone. Instead, the president has chosen to punish the states that did not vote for him.

As a senator and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will use every tool at my disposal to push back against this president’s attack on our democracy.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth and I recently traveled to Broadview to visit the ICE processing facility there. We were denied entry. This was the fourth time I asked to visit the facility in several weeks, and the Trump administration has denied me entry every time. What does DHS have to hide?

Contrary to the Trump administration’s highly produced videos posted online, demonstrations at Broadview have been overwhelmingly peaceful. I’ve spoken with protestors, just a few of the hundreds of people who have rallied together outside of the ICE facility to push back against federal agents’ actions.

Who will protect Illinoisans and all Americans from masked immigration agents and federal troops?

And while the president says he’s deporting the “worst of the worst,” 70% of the people stopped by DHS and accused of violations have no criminal record. ProPublica reports that federal immigration agents detained at least 170 U.S. citizens in the first nine months of President Trump’s second term. And that number is only growing.

In one incident, a U.S. citizen said immigration agents arrested him at his Chicago home, detaining him even after he presented his birth certificate. In another case, federal agents arrested a U.S. citizen service worker on her way home because, as she told the Chicago Tribune, the agents said she didn’t “look like” the name on her passport.

My constituents live in constant fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions. President Trump threatens to unleash military forces to “protect federal buildings and agents.” But who will protect Illinoisans and all Americans from masked immigration agents and federal troops?

A federal judge has limited ICE officers’ use of warrantless arrests. Another ordered federal agents not to indiscriminately deploy tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on peaceful protestors, journalists and clergy. But there are serious questions as to whether immigration agents are obeying.

I’ve called on Secretary Noem to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold her accountable for unlawful actions. And I’m working with other Illinois leaders, including Sen. Duckworth, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, to halt these clear abuses of power by the president.

President Trump does not want to fight crime. He wants to spread fear. And he is destroying the values that define us as Americans. I will continue to hold this administration accountable for its unlawful actions and to stop the president’s unnecessary and dangerous deployment of our nation’s military to city streets.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251107-ICE-zz-5bf2c3.jpg",N,,2025-11-10 09:18:47.520948

He alleges that IPS is limiting ICE's access to school grounds and prohibiting IPS employees from assisting or sharing information with ICE.
Rokita says these policies are not only illegal but are also making schools ""vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens.""
According to court documents, the district does not allow ICE officers inside school buildings without a warrant.
Rokita alleges that IPS instead connected the student with an immigration attorney and that the father and son missed their deportation flight.","Indianapolis Public Schools is pushing back against Attorney General Todd Rokita's ""silly litigation"" and rhetoric that school officials say has left them ""deeply offended.""

Why it matters: Acting on behalf of the state, Rokita is suing Indiana's largest school district for policies he says make it hard for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to do their jobs.

Driving the news: Rokita filed his lawsuit with the Marion County courts late last week.

He alleges that IPS is limiting ICE's access to school grounds and prohibiting IPS employees from assisting or sharing information with ICE.

Rokita says these policies are not only illegal but are also making schools ""vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens.""

""It's happened in many other states — and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe,"" Rokita said in a news release.

The other side: IPS says it's doing just that — keeping kids safe.

""Indianapolis Public Schools is committed to ensuring safe, supportive and welcoming learning environments for all students,"" the district said in a statement. ""As has always been the case, we will continue to uphold the law while keeping these commitments.""

According to court documents, the district does not allow ICE officers inside school buildings without a warrant.

""While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families and taxpayers,"" the district said. ""Every dollar spent on defensive legal posture is a dollar not spent on instructional support, teacher development, student services or enrichment.""

""In this case, Mr. Rokita prefers those dollars go to fight gratuitous political battles, as has too often been the case.""

Zoom in: The lawsuit stems from a January incident in which ICE was attempting to get an IPS student out of school to board a voluntary deportation flight with his father, a Honduran national who was in the country illegally.

Rokita alleges that IPS instead connected the student with an immigration attorney and that the father and son missed their deportation flight.

Rokita says ICE also needs school cooperation in looking for nearly 400,000 unaccompanied minors ""who are vulnerable to exploitation by human traffickers"" and when ""criminal illegal aliens, like MS-13 gang members, infiltrate school locations.""

Flashback: Previous ICE guidance that directed officers to avoid sensitive locations — including schools, hospitals, churches and marches — was scrapped by the Trump administration on his second day in office.

What's next: Rokita is asking the courts to compel IPS to change its policies to be in compliance with state laws that prohibit local government entities from limiting their employees' engagement in activities related to the enforcement of immigration laws.",https://images.axios.com/HPvp7DAK_09h7gUnvVEcXZw61N0=/1366x768/smart/2023/10/26/170803-1698340083087.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:38.687514

The operation involved local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the Kenner Police Department, which said the raid was part of a two-month joint investigation.

They’re literally picking up anyone who looks Hispanic and turning them over to ICE.” Taber accused Kenner police of racial profiling, which Conley denied.","KENNER, La. — Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that 13 people are in custody following a multi-agency raid at the Kenner boat launch in the Lake Town area Friday night.

According to a statement by ICE, all 13 detainees are undocumented and in violation of immigration policies. Officials said one person in custody had previously been ordered removed by an immigration judge, and another had already been deported once before.

The operation involved local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the Kenner Police Department, which said the raid was part of a two-month joint investigation.

“We’ve always had complaints out there — nuisance crimes, everything from traffic to litter to loud music,” said Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley. “We go out there and police it, but it seemed like the activity was escalating into just lawlessness.”

WWL asked Conley why ICE was involved in the joint operation.

“We brought them in because we knew there was going to be a large amount of Hispanics out there,” he said. “We’ve had ICE assist us with some gang activity or gang affiliations that come through the city.”

That statement drew criticism from Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group that said the collaboration puts Hispanic residents at risk.

“People are traumatized,” said Union Migrante volunteer Rachel Taber. “Their loved ones who have been here working for years, with no criminal record, are now in ICE detention. They’re literally picking up anyone who looks Hispanic and turning them over to ICE.”

Taber accused Kenner police of racial profiling, which Conley denied.

“I can assure you they’re not,” Conley said. “If they have a complaint, they’re welcome to contact our internal affairs, the Department of Justice or the FBI. We’re an open book.”

When asked whether any of those detained were in the process of obtaining legal status or visas, an ICE spokesperson said, “Not that I’m aware of.”

The investigation remains ongoing.

The bottom line: Mamdani addressed some of Trump's attacks during his victory speech on Tuesday, promising ""a shining city for all.""

Why it matters: Republicans aren't just making immigration tougher. They're also sowing fear that Mamdani's popularity will ripple through other American cities with big immigrant populations.

""Import communists, become communists,"" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted before Tuesday's election. He shared a poll showing Mamdani was winning a majority of foreign-born voters.

""What we don't want to see is more Dearborns,"" said Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, referring to the first Arab-majority city in the U.S. It's represented by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a first-generation Palestinian American.

Republicans also are singling out Minneapolis, where Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a naturalized citizen from Somalia, represents the city in Congress. ""What we don't want to see are more 100% Somalian communities that actually are Islamist and Marxist,"" Roberts told Axios.

The big picture: MAGA's crackdown on legal immigration will ""disproportionately limit people from third world countries, which obviously are not comprised of white people,"" said former Trump Homeland Security official Mike Howell, who now runs the Oversight Project.

Howell said it's time for conservatives to stop fixating on ""legal good and illegal bad"" and start focusing on assimilation.

Zoom in: The U.S. has slashed refugee admissions from 100,000 slots in President Biden's last year to 7,500 (mostly for white South Africans) in 2026.

The citizenship test will be getting more difficult, with stricter enforcement of English language proficiency for immigrants.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is screening for ""good character,"" which now looks for community involvement and contributions to the U.S. and ties to the country, among other factors.

Non-immigrant visas (for temporary travel), particularly from African countries, and H1B visas (for work), primarily awarded to Indians, have become more expensive and harder to get.

Between the lines: The Trump administration is also looking to denaturalize (stripping citizenship) some new Americans, with cases already sent for Justice Department review.

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) penned a public letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking her to investigate Mamdani's citizenship application for possible denaturalization. His charge is echoed by Republican colleague Randy Fine (R-Flo.) and right wing online influencers.

The New York Young Republicans also sold t-shirts that read ""Deport Zohran"" during the campaign.

Zoom out: President Trump has questioned Mamdani's citizenship (he was naturalized in 2018) and repeatedly claimed that Mamdani is a communist. Mamdani is a democratic socialist, not a communist.

Trump used a similar line of attack when he falsely claimed for years that former President Obama wasn't born in the U.S. and was not eligible to be president.

Trump also suggested on numerous occasions that Omar, who became a citizen at 17, should ""go back"" to Somalia.

The bottom line: Mamdani addressed some of Trump's attacks during his victory speech on Tuesday, promising ""a shining city for all.""

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants — and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said.

Around 9 p.m. he decided to head back to his Burbank hotel.
“I recognize that he missed his court appointment, but he was an unhoused foster youth,” she said.
He saw a flyer for Los Angeles’ Trade Tech community college and qualified for a scholarship that covered classes and housing there.
While attending college, Pecero learned about the advocacy work being done on behalf of foster youth by California Youth Connection.","Part one of a two-part series.

Axel Pecero was lost.

It was a warm and clear August night, just hours before the sun would rise, and he was wandering an unfamiliar part of Los Angeles with little money and a dead phone.

But the worst was yet to come.

By the next day, Pecero would become one of the thousands of undocumented people swept up in the Trump Administration’s immigration dragnet.

Since Aug. 6, Pecero has been in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The 25-year-old former foster youth and father, who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a small child, is being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County and faces possible deportation.

Over the past few years, Pecero has worked as an advocate for young people involved in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. Dozens of letters of support for the South L.A. man have been submitted to the court on his behalf.

Pecero hopes the letters and the efforts of his immigration attorney will prevent him from being sent away from the only country he has known as home.

“I’m really hoping that the judge is able to see that I’m working on my education,” Pecero said from Adelanto in a 30-minute phone interview with The Imprint. “I want to be able to stay here with my son and continue living my life.”

He has watched other detainees being shackled and whisked away in the middle of the night by ICE agents, their shirts emblazoned with the word “Deportation.”

In the call, Pecero described the series of missteps and decisions that brought him to a deserted Burbank street on a dark night and placed him in the crosshairs of the nation’s unprecedented crackdown on immigrants.

In the weeks following his detention at Adelanto, a notorious facility known for its poor conditions, Pecero has cycled through feelings of frustration and helplessness, he said. He has watched other detainees being shackled and whisked away in the middle of the night by ICE agents, their shirts emblazoned with the word “Deportation.”

Life was just beginning to click into place for the former foster youth as he settled into his mid-20s. After years of upheaval and instability, he is today a proud father who dons suits to testify for foster youth at the state Capitol. He has earned a reputation as a dedicated advocate. He was in the process of trying to leave his mistakes behind and clear his record.

Now he wonders: Will all of the effort that he’s made in recent years to get off the streets and change his life be undone?

“No matter how much I thought I was American — I wasn’t,” Pecero said. “I really hope I have the opportunity to solidify the foundation for the life that I want to lead.”

His current predicament illustrates how missteps that others might attribute to youth can yield enormous consequences for the undocumented amid the current administration’s aggressive immigration operation.

On Aug 5, the night before he wound up in ICE custody, Pecero went to Hollywood to meet a friend and see a band perform. He had traveled from Burbank, about 16 miles away, where he was attending a work conference on youth with substance and behavioral health issues.

Around 9 p.m. he decided to head back to his Burbank hotel. He had an early morning commitment, he told his friend; he was participating in a training session for organizations serving young people in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.

He rode a bus back to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles where he hoped to take a commuter train to Burbank. But once there, he realized he had miscalculated — he didn’t have enough money for the fare. His only option, he said, was to take several local buses to reach his hotel.

The first bus never arrived. He waited for a different one but it didn’t show up for another hour. It was 3:30 a.m. when he finally arrived at his next stop. Rather than wait for a bus that wasn’t scheduled to come for yet another hour, Pecero decided to walk the rest of the way, he said.

But now he had another problem. His phone battery was running out of power.

“Are you on probation or parole?’’

By the time he made it back to Burbank on foot, Pecero’s phone was dead. Without a navigation app, he had little idea where he was.

He found himself in an industrial part of the city, near the airport, he said. He trudged along San Fernando Boulevard, thinking that everything would turn out all right if he could just make it back to the hotel in time for his morning training session.

He was hopeful. He felt he was getting closer.

Then a bright beam of light sliced through the night and fell on him.

“Are you on probation or parole?” a voice boomed out from the darkness.

Pecero told the men in the police cruiser that he was neither. He told them he was lost. He asked for a ride to his hotel.

The voice demanded his identification, and now, he said, it sounded hostile.

“Am I under arrest?’’ Pecero asked. “Am I being detained?”

The Burbank police officers told him, “No,” so Pecero told them he would keep on walking. He asked for directions to the hotel.

Then it happened. He was pushed against the police car and handcuffed, he said. The officers had run his name and found an outstanding warrant related to an unpaid traffic ticket he received for driving without a license in 2021. The arrest warrant was issued after he didn’t show up for a court date on the matter.

It was a little after 5 a.m. when Pecero arrived at the police station. He was fingerprinted, jailed and promised, he said, that he would be released “soon.’’ Hours later, he walked out of the Burbank jail.

Two Homeland Security officers were waiting for him.

“At that moment, I felt my heart drop,” Pecero said.On the other side

It all felt so surreal.

Days earlier, Pecero had passed several U.S. Marines stationed outside a federal building surrounded by demonstrators protesting the immigration raids and sweeps taking place across the city at schools, Home Depots and worksites.

“No matter how much I thought I was American — I wasn’t.”

— Axel Pecero

Now, he was on the other side of the tempest, awaiting transport to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, a detention facility that lies about a two-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles.

What stung most, Pecero recalled, was the casual banter between the two ICE agents waiting with him. As the seriousness of his predicament pressed more heavily on him with each passing moment, the agents traded wisecracks about the number of people they had picked up that day. They bragged that they were going on another “money run” later that day to detain other immigrants.

“I would hope my life is not like a pawn in somebody’s game or just extra money in somebody’s paycheck,” Pecero told The Imprint.

Meanwhile, back at the Burbank hotel where he’d been staying, Pecero’s colleagues were worried. He hadn’t shown up for his training session. No one knew where he was.

Tasha Norton-James, a trainer with the organization running the event, brought her concerns to hotel staff and asked to enter his room. Inside, they found his possessions, but no sign of Pecero. No one knew what to think until his brother arrived at the hotel later that afternoon with news of the arrest and detention. The brother had come to collect his belongings.

Norton-James is among Pecero’s friends and supporters who find it troubling that Burbank police stopped Pecero in the first place, when he was simply walking on a city street.

And they don’t understand how a man with traffic-related misdemeanors fits the profile of those the federal government has said are the targets of ICE operations — “the murderers, the MS-13 gang members, the pedophiles and rapists,” that Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin referred to in a statement last July.

“They’re supposed to be picking up the ‘worst of the worst’ criminals, but they detained Axel, who’s making this world a better place,” Norton-James said.

A ‘normal’ childhood

Pecero arrived in the U.S. when he was 3, brought to Los Angeles by his grandmother. He lived with an aunt and uncle until his parents arrived from Mexico, he said.

When Pecero was 8, his mother returned to Mexico. He remained in the U.S. with his father, but at 16, moved in with an aunt to escape his father’s abuse, he said.

Pecero never formally entered the county’s child welfare system. Instead, he lived with his aunt under an informal arrangement referred to as “hidden foster care.’’ As an unlicensed caregiver, his aunt wasn’t eligible for county resources and support that other relatives and foster parents receive.

At this point in his life, Pecero says he lived like any other typical teen in the U.S. — attending high school and crazy about basketball. Friends recall that he couldn’t pass by a pickup game without asking to join in.

“Growing up, I always thought I was normal,” he said.

But after graduating in 2018, Pecero went from one unstable housing situation to another. Eventually he wound up living in his car.

Two “cite-and-release” cases during that time continue to have far-reaching repercussions for him. In 2020, a joyriding incident led to four misdemeanor charges, including being in possession of a stolen vehicle, court records show.

In March 2021, Pecero was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without a license. It was a warrant for failing to appear in court for that case that led to his recent arrest.

Both cases are on hold while he is being held in Adelanto, though the latter case has escalated dramatically. Because Pecero was in ICE detention and failed to appear for a court date in late August, his initial $10 bail amount now carries a $100,000 bench warrant.

California State Sen. Caroline Menjivar — who is familiar with Pecero’s case and is advocating for his release — said youthful missteps like this should not lead to imprisonment and possible deportation. In an interview, she said she sees parallels in Pecero’s life experiences to her own. She also had run-ins with the law as a young person.

But she said she believes making mistakes is a normal part of growing up, and noted research showing that the area of the human brain that governs impulse control and decision-making doesn’t mature until well after the teenage years.

“They’re supposed to be picking up the ‘worst of the worst’ criminals, but they detained Axel, who’s making this world a better place.”

— Tasha Norton-James

And traumatic and destabilizing events like family separation and homelessness — both of which Pecero experienced — can disrupt development and narrow choices, Menjivar and his other supporters say.

“I recognize that he missed his court appointment, but he was an unhoused foster youth,” she said. “What do we expect from somebody who we turned our backs on? What do we expect when we do not provide the resources for him?”

Finding family

Learning he was going to become a father is what pushed Pecero to seek stability, he said. He saved $600 to rent a room in a house and move out of his car. He saw a flyer for Los Angeles’ Trade Tech community college and qualified for a scholarship that covered classes and housing there.

While attending college, Pecero learned about the advocacy work being done on behalf of foster youth by California Youth Connection. The nonprofit’s mission and sense of community spoke to him. He decided to join.

“They really just took me in, like the family that I didn’t have,” he said.

Over the past two years, his advocacy has grown to include projects with the Los Angeles County Office of Education — work that has taken him from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. Sometimes he would bring his son, now 4, to community meetings and conferences. He called the boy his inspiration.

“Before my son, I didn’t really have any set goals,” said Pecero. “I’ve really tried my best to change, and to be somebody for my son.” He hopes to become a social worker one day.

Now, roughly 80 miles separate father and son, and Pecero’s future rests in the hands of an immigration judge who will determine whether he will be allowed to stay in the country.

In the meantime, he has found a purpose and a rhythm to his days at Adelanto by helping other detainees. He uses his fluent English and Spanish skills to translate documents for others. He collects commissary money for birthday gifts for detainees — a diverse group that includes people who speak Arabic, Mandarin and Punjabi.

He’s also begun writing as a way to pass time and take his mind off his situation, he said.

The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to Berlin to discuss the issue.
And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.","When Germany opened its doors to refugees escaping war in the Middle East, more people arrived from Syria than any other country – finding homes, getting jobs, starting families.

A question mark now hangs over their future, after Germany’s government – which has hardened its stance on immigration amid a surging far right – suggested it could be time for some to return home, voluntarily or not.

Some 1 million Syrians arrived in Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015-2016, under former chancellor Angela Merkel. Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.

Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.

Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”

While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.

The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to Berlin to discuss the issue.

What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government is no more, bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.

Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.

Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.

Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.

The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.

“Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.

Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”

Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.

“We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.

Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has seen flare-ups of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.

Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”

Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to Damascus, when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.

But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.

Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”

The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.

Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.

Countering the far right

Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.

The AfD came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”

Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.

Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.

While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government announced sweeping revisions to migration policy after taking office.

“We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-507772826.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-09 20:57:49.874528

The Trump administration continues its aggressive campaign to detain and deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Multiple cities are at the center of these efforts, including Chicago and Los Angeles. Now the Department of Homeland Security says the crackdown, which started shortly after President Trump took office, has resulted in the removal of more than half a million undocumented immigrants so far. To fact-check these numbers and put them in context, we're joined now by NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Welcome, Sergio.

SERGIO MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha.

RASCOE: So where does that figure - 500,000 people deported - come from, and is it accurate?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, the pace of deportations has clearly increased by a lot under Trump, but it's not clear that this half-million figure is accurate. This number comes from a DHS-issued press release, but it did not provide any evidence or additional information. Now, NPR repeatedly requested data from DHS to support that claim, and they have not yet responded.

RASCOE: Is it unusual for administrations to have this kind of lack of transparency on immigration figures?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: So administrations typically provide some evidence to back their deportation numbers, even if it's just annually. Look, ICE collects a lot of data on every person it arrests, detains, transports and deports. But this administration is not releasing all of that information. They have released some detention numbers that show people at a given time in immigration facilities, but they have not released a breakdown of deportation numbers.

I talked to Dara Lind with the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. She has compared these latest DHS deportation numbers to data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Deportation Data Project at UC Berkeley and UCLA. That data she looked at is through June, and Lind says there is a significant gap.

DARA LIND: They definitely are engaging in more removals in the data that we have toward the end of that period than at the beginning. We're still looking at fewer than 7,500 removals a week. That's a lot of people. It's a lot of people, but it's nowhere near the number that you would need to have gotten to 500,000.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Even if they have kept up that high rate of 7,500 deportations a week, that would have totaled 300,000 in the first 10 months of this administration. And as Lind says, that's way short of its aggressive goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants every year. The administration also says that more than 1.6 million undocumented immigrants have left the country on their own this year. But again, they have not provided any data to back that up.

RASCOE: The Trump administration regularly claims that the vast majority of those detained - 70% - are criminals charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S. Here's DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin recently on Fox News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN: We have 10,000 new ICE enforcement officers that are going to be hired in the coming days, so we know that we're going to continue to arrest the worst of the worst off of the streets of America's sanctuary cities and across the nation.

RASCOE: So, Sergio, worst of the worst, 70% criminals - is this accurate?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: No. Not really, Ayesha. According to DHS' own detention data, 53% of immigration detainees had either pending charges or a conviction. The rest had no criminal record. And it's important to note that the 53% includes violations like property theft and traffic violations. One report in June from the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute found that only about 7% of the people booked by ICE had serious or violent convictions. The other 93% either did not have a violent conviction or any convictions at all. Here's Dara Lind again with the American Immigration Council.

LIND: They don't see a particularly strong difference between people who have committed very serious crimes and people who have no contact with the criminal justice system whatsoever but who are in the U.S. without documentation.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: For context, two things to keep in mind here - first, entering the country illegally, coming in without documentation, is often a misdemeanor. And once in the U.S., if a migrant gets picked up without papers, that is often a civil offense.

RASCOE: That's NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Thank you so much for joining us.

Amid the enforcement, legal policy analysts are divided over whether federal or state governments should control immigration and border security.
He said this understanding of federal power extends to immigration and prohibits states from creating their own immigration restrictions.
“You have things that are non economic but involve crossing borders, whether economically or not, that Congress should regulate if it’s crossing state borders or international borders or tribal borders,” Amar said.

Amid the enforcement, legal policy analysts are divided over whether federal or state governments should control immigration and border security.

The U.S. The Department of Homeland Security reported fewer than 500,000 border encounters so far in 2025 compared to more than two million per year in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

A panel of lawyers spoke at the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention on Friday about whether state governments were granted sovereignty to control immigration and naturalization by founding documents, like the U.S. Constitution.

Gene Hamilton, president of the America First Policy Institute, said the United States’ founders established immigration enforcement as a power of the federal government when it granted sovereignty to the government.

“The executive power would have been thought to have included the inherent authority to prevent the entry of people into the country,” Hamilton said of the founding father’s intentions.

Hamilton said President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order to pursue border security used authorities that belong to the executive branch in securing the sovereignty of a nation.

“I think the president’s position, as expressed in this order, is more consistent with an originalist understanding at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of what the federal government could have done to protect its own borders without requiring necessary implementing legislation from the Congress,” Hamilton said.

Trevor Ezell, general counsel for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and a member of the panel, argued that state governments have often stepped into the role of enforcing immigration throughout the history of the United States.

He pointed out the 1837 Supreme Court case Mayor of New York City v. Milne, which upheld New York’s ability to impose a fine if a ship captain did not list the number of migrants on its boat when entering the state.

“States have the same power as foreign nations to exclude individuals from their territory,” Ezell said.

Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of law at Yale, said state governments should only have control over immigration if the federal government grants that authority.

“There are inherent powers of the federal government and control of the borders would be one of them, and that’s connected to sovereignty and how we interact with foreign nations,” Amar said. “States don’t get to do many of these things unless they’re permitted by the federal government.”

In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down several portions of a law in Arizona that gave state officials broad authority over immigration enforcement, in place of the federal government.

“It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States must be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national sovereign, not 50 separate states,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the court’s majority opinion.

Amar brought up the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to defend his argument. The clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among states and with Indian tribes.

Amar argued that the establishment of federal power over Indian tribes extends to Indian tribe affairs in general, especially when considering the language of the articles of confederation. He said this understanding of federal power extends to immigration and prohibits states from creating their own immigration restrictions.

“You have things that are non economic but involve crossing borders, whether economically or not, that Congress should regulate if it’s crossing state borders or international borders or tribal borders,” Amar said.

Hamilton argued that states should have a role in the protection of its borders when the federal government does not adhere to a responsibility to protect people who come into a certain state. He highlighted that state borders are more strictly defined now than when the constitution was first drafted and, therefore, require more nuanced enforcement measures.

“What happens when the federal government fails, completely fails, completely abdicates its responsibility to prevent people from coming to a state? Does that state not have the inherent power to guard its own borders,” Hamilton asked.

Amar pointed out that the Constitution omits the word “sovereign” when referring to the power of the states. He said this is a pointed omission because the Articles of Confederation, a predecessor document to the U.S. Constitution, provided for state sovereignty.

Ezell pointed out examples in Texas’ history where the federal government deferred to the state to handle immigration enforcement. He said both state and federal governments are sovereign entities that deserve to have the same enforcement measures.

“An exercise of enforcement discretion is in no way preemptive of the other sovereign’s prescription of the same underlying activity,” Ezell said.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/06/22080503/54348746664_8774fee7ff_k-1024x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 20:57:14.022618

“Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.” The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.
Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.
Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action.","The mayor of Chicago on Friday (November 7, 2025) invited a panel of independent United Nations experts to examine what he called the federal government’s “abusive immigration crackdowns” in the nation’s third-largest city.

Speaking before members of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) accused President Donald Trump’s administration and federal immigration officials of violating the “dignity of all Chicagoans” with violent raids, and he asked the human rights council to hold a special session to discuss “the worsening human rights crisis in the United States.”

“I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said in the virtual address. “No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal – or they are meaningless.”

Since the Department of Homeland Security launched its “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement operation in the Chicago area in early September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have descended on worksites, dragged residents through neighborhood streets and used chemical irritants to disperse protesters – tactics that a federal judge said “shocks the conscience.”

On Wednesday, immigration officers arrested a teacher after chasing her onto the grounds of a private preschool. The incident appears to be one of the first instances during Trump’s second administration in which immigration officers entered and made an arrest on school grounds – once considered off limits to enforcement actions. DHS disputed that the woman was arrested inside the school, saying she was detained in a “vestibule.”

In his remarks, Johnson characterized these kinds of incidents as stemming from a “moral failure” on the part of the Trump administration.

In a statement to The Washington Post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin blasted Johnson for “demonizing ICE and CBP law enforcement,” adding that federal officers are facing increasing assaults as they use more aggressive tactics to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

“Mayor Johnson has shown time and time again he does not care about the innocent American lives taken at the hands of gang members, murderers, drug traffickers, and rapists who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said. “Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.”

The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.

The enforcement operation is part of the administration’s broader crackdown on “sanctuary cities,” which have long drawn Trump’s ire. Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

“Operation Midway Blitz” has resulted in the arrests of 3,000 undocumented immigrants throughout Illinois and northern Indiana, according to DHS.

Johnson said the deportation campaign has had a destabilizing effect on the city, and the harms extended beyond immigrant communities.

“In Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood – a proud, predominantly Black community – federal agents carried out what can only be described as a military-style raid designed for social media spectacle,” Johnson said. After the raid, DHS published to social media a video, set to cinematic music, of the operation.

“Helicopters circled overhead. Doors were kicked in. Homes were destroyed. Immigrant residents were detained in one van, while Black families – including young children – were held in another,” Johnson added.

Authorities said that they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Two of the 37 immigrants arrested in that raid were gang members, and dozens of U.S. citizens’ apartments were targeted.

On the city’s West Side, federal agents placed a Black man in a chokehold and forced him to the ground just steps from the doors of the legal nonprofit Westside Center for Justice, Johnson said. Earlier this week, federal agents rammed into the vehicle of Dayanne Figueroa before taking her into custody “for no apparent reason,” he added.

“These are not isolated incidents. They are reminders that the fate of our communities – Black, Brown, immigrant – is bound together,” Johnson said. “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. And in Chicago, we will stand united in defense of our shared dignity, safety and freedom.”

Johnson also sought to draw the U.N. body’s attention to the lapse in federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. In Chicago, roughly 1 in 5 households receive food assistance, according to official state data.

“As someone with first-hand experience, I can tell you how humiliating it is when you open the refrigerator and you have nothing to eat,” Johnson said. “In the wealthiest country in the world, there is no reason why our federal government should allow hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to go hungry.”

Friday’s address comes after the Trump administration skipped a review of its human rights record, known as the Universal Periodic Review. In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.

Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action. Members can also hold crisis meetings, known as “special sessions.”

In his remarks Friday, Johnson slammed the Trump administration for “fail[ing] to meet even the most basic expectations of transparency and accountability before this council.”

“By refusing to submit its Universal Periodic Review report and declining to appear for its review, this administration seeks to evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights – just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine,” he said.",https://newsindiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-09-142930.png,N,,2025-11-09 15:16:51.636806

“President Trump needs to stop trying to force Americans to go hungry and pay full SNAP benefits for everyone,” said Gov.
The legal wrangling over SNAP began on Thursday, after a federal court in Rhode Island ordered the White House to tap two accounts at the Agriculture Department to fund SNAP benefits in full.
The Trump administration then turned to the Supreme Court, where Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay.
Those include California, Michigan, New Jersey and Wisconsin, where it remained unclear by Saturday how the Supreme Court decision might immediately affect their low-income residents.","Millions of low-income families around the country confronted new delays and disruptions to their food stamp benefits on Saturday, after a late-night Supreme Court order allowed the Trump administration to continue withholding some funding for the nation’s largest anti-hunger program.

Only one day earlier, states including Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Oregon had started sending full benefits to the roughly one in eight Americans who receive aid each month, seeking to put an end to weeks of uncertainty and spare the poorest Americans from severe financial hardship.

But the process appeared to grind to a halt on Friday night. The Supreme Court granted an emergency request by the Trump administration to pause an order issued by a federal judge, who had required the White House to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

The decision once again upended food stamps, which are funded by the federal government and administered by states. It marked the latest turn in a weekslong legal battle waged by local leaders and nonprofits, which have filed multiple lawsuits to ensure that about 42 million low-income Americans would not lose their ability to buy groceries during the federal shutdown.

Throughout the closure, now the longest in history, the White House has refused to tap an ample store of leftover money that would prevent severe interruptions to the nutrition program. While the Supreme Court order was only temporary, it still appeared to freeze some of the work to restart food stamps, particularly in states that had not yet made full payments to all of their residents.

In effect, that meant some of the families that had already gone days without aid faced the prospect of an even longer wait.

In Ohio, state leaders initially told local families on SNAP that they could receive full food stamps by next week, only to have to announce that benefits had been “delayed” shortly after the Supreme Court order.

Others, like Michigan and North Carolina, had intended to make payments swiftly, but had to abandon their effort by the weekend. In Massachusetts, officials said they had managed to send full aid to residents who were owed a payment by Friday. But state leaders said they remained unsure when benefits would reach low-income families that were scheduled to receive their food stamps next week.

In New Jersey, officials expressed fear that the federal government could target the firm that manages the cards used by SNAP recipients to purchase groceries, and potentially prevent the vendor from drawing down federal funds, upending the entire program. In many other states, including Louisiana and Texas, there was no updated information at all.

Even among food stamp recipients who had received their monthly allowances, there emerged early signs of disruption. That included in New York, which announced on Friday — hours before the Supreme Court intervened — that it would furnish long-awaited grocery aid to residents. By Saturday, the state continued to forge ahead, in the hopes of releasing the food stamp money by the end of the weekend.

At the Empire Grocery & Deli on Ninth Avenue, near 25th Street in Manhattan, Duwanna Alford swiped her E.B.T. card that morning, hoping she could use the $298 in her account to buy a breakfast sandwich for her 9-year-old grandson. But when she looked down at the payment screen, Ms. Alford, 58, saw her card had been declined.

A frequent visitor to that deli for more than a decade, she immediately pulled out her phone and called the hotline for SNAP, which administers the E.B.T. cards. Ms. Alford said she got a busy signal.

On the other side of the counter, the cashier, Sanad Ali, 34, shook his head. He said he had seen many failed E.B.T. transactions recently at his store, a lifeline for low-income families in the Chelsea neighborhood, where very few delis accept food stamps. The disruption, he added, had squeezed his business, too.

“You see how it’s quiet? You see how it’s dead?” he said.

The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment.

By its own admission, the Trump administration can access tens of billions in leftover funds to finance SNAP benefits this month, sparing the program from any interruption. But Mr. Trump has declined to use that money, and his aides have claimed they cannot help, despite the fact that they have reworked other parts of the federal budget to sustain their priorities during the shutdown — including to pay officers conducting mass deportations.

Many Democrats have expressed public outrage over what they view as a double standard that ultimately reduced the nation’s work to combat hunger to a bargaining chip during the shutdown.

“President Trump needs to stop trying to force Americans to go hungry and pay full SNAP benefits for everyone,” said Gov. Maura T. Healey of Massachusetts, a Democrat, who added in a statement that her state was assessing the implications of the court’s actions.

The legal wrangling over SNAP began on Thursday, after a federal court in Rhode Island ordered the White House to tap two accounts at the Agriculture Department to fund SNAP benefits in full. Absent that order, which was the second issued by that judge, the government would have provided only partial benefits — with some families receiving nothing this month, and others waiting many weeks for assistance.

The Justice Department immediately challenged that ruling, but the appeals court declined on Friday to block the judge’s order from taking immediate effect. The Trump administration then turned to the Supreme Court, where Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay.

The justice, who handles emergency applications from courts in that part of the country, essentially left it to the appeals court to decide what to do. That means the panel of judges must determine whether to halt or preserve the original order requiring the White House to fund SNAP benefits in full this month. A decision is expected quickly.

But the result, in the meantime, was legal whiplash for the families who rely on the food stamp program, even in states that had recently announced they would begin funding benefits in full. Those include California, Michigan, New Jersey and Wisconsin, where it remained unclear by Saturday how the Supreme Court decision might immediately affect their low-income residents.

Many of those states had sued the Trump administration over SNAP funding in a case still being heard in a court in Massachusetts. On Saturday, they asked a judge there to issue an order prohibiting the Agriculture Department from punishing them for their handling of benefits during the shutdown.

“It is downright cruel that the Trump administration is still trying to cut off food benefits from millions of Americans,” Matthew J. Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

He added that it was “unconscionable” that the Agriculture Department had issued conflicting guidance about payments, while promising that New Jersey would “not stop fighting to ensure that full SNAP benefits remain available to our residents.”

In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement Saturday that his state had been “working to process” benefits when the Supreme Court ruling came down, and he promised to “work quickly” once a final decision in the case was reached.

Gavin Lesnick, a spokesman for Arkansas’s Department of Human Services, said that SNAP funds there remained on hold while officials awaited guidance from the Agriculture Department. Only then, Mr. Lesnick added, could Arkansas “finalize benefit amounts or an issuance date.”

In a handful of other states that had opted to fund SNAP using their own funds, there were no signs of trouble. In Connecticut, an official said the state planned to provide full benefits to residents by the end of Saturday, while in Vermont, a local lawmaker confirmed that the state had tapped its own money to front aid for the next two weeks.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08DC-SNAP-czbm/08DC-SNAP-czbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 14:56:28.763133

In a survey from NBC News released Nov. 9, two-thirds of registered voters said the Trump administration has not lived up to their expectations on addressing inflation and the cost of living. Many Americans are also unhappy with the way the administration has affected the middle class, with 65% saying Trump has not lived up to their hopes.

President Donald Trump's approval rating in the poll was 43%, a 4-point decrease since the outlet's March survey, while 55% said they disapprove of his job performance.

The numbers align with several recent surveys: The president's average rating across polls is 42% approval and 55% disapproval, according to a New York Times calculation. RealClearPolitics' Nov. 9 average is similar, 43% approval and 54% disapproval.

The survey is the latest to show voters souring on the administration's handling of the economy. It's a frustration Democrats seized on in last week's Nov. 4 election, when the party won key races across the country.

Respondents in the NBC News survey said they preferred Democrats over Republicans to lead the new Congress in 2027 by 8 points, with 50% saying they prefer Democratic control over 42% wanting a GOP-led legislature. It's the largest lead for either party on the congressional ballot in the NBC poll since the 2018 midterms – and a 7-point jump in Democrats' lead since March.

When it comes to the ongoing shutdown, 49% said either Republicans in Congress or Trump are at fault, and 42% said Democrats in Congress are to blame.

However, the survey found it's not an entirely rosy picture for the Democrats. Just 28% of respondents viewed the party positively, compared to Republicans' 37%. On the issues of crime and immigration, Republicans were seen as more capable, while Democrats outranked them on health care and democracy.

And though a majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with Republicans over the economy, they still held a one-point advantage over Democrats in the poll on the issue.

More broadly, 61% of survey respondents said the country was moving in the wrong direction, marking a 7-point increase since the pollsters last asked the question in March.

The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28. The margin of error is ± 3.1 percentage points.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/09/USAT/87183374007-20251107-t-175553-z-126268047-rc-2-srhaskllj-rtrmadp-3-usahungary.JPG?crop=5499,3093,x0,y550&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-09 14:17:48.079460

The Universal Periodic Review

The Universal Periodic Review is designed to promote and protect human rights in every UN member country.

The UPR was established in 2006, and occurs every four to five years. Its aim is to review each of the 193 UN member states’ human rights record. The most recent review session took place on Friday, at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. There was no US representative present.

This has shocked the international human rights community and also sparked widespread criticism and concern. The move ends nearly two decades of unbroken US participation, and comes at a time when there has been growing concerns over America’s human rights record. The US absence raises serious questions not only about accountability, but also the undermining of global efforts on human rights.

US Human Rights absence

Amnesty International called the US boycott of its UPR “shocking,” and accused Washington of “walking away from even the impression of caring about the safety and security of people in the US and around the world.”

Human Rights Watch said although the US may avoid this formal scrutiny for a time,

it will only generate international criticism and further erode its place on the world stage.

Larry Krasner, District Attorney of Philadelphia, claimed Trump did not want a report card on “his unceasing violations of human rights”. He said the President “wants to be Adolf Hitler,” and it was unsurprising the “criminal” Trump administration “wants to escape accountability”.

To support the US review, hundreds of organisations had submitted reports on a wide range of human rights violations taking place in the country. These included arbitrary detention, and regression in sexual, reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights. Raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), systemic racial discrimination and the abusive treatment of immigrants were also on the agenda for discussion. So were the excessive use of force during demonstrations, attacks on free speech, and the death penalty.

US has refused to attend its UPR

The US decision to disengage from this review is linked directly to Trump’s administration. It ordered the move following the February 4 executive order to withdraw from several UN agencies. These were the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), along with the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and also the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In a statement, the White House claimed these UN bodies have “drifted from their mission” and instead:

act contrary to the interests of the United States while attacking our allies and propagating anti-Semitism.

The US Department of State issued another statement on Friday. It framed its withdrawal from the UPR as a rejection of what it sees as the Human Rights Council’s failures to condemn severe human rights violations from UNHRC members such as Venezuela, China, and Sudan. It also stated that the US would not accept lectures about its human rights record from these countries.

Significant and multiple human rights abuses

Recent reports show disturbing human rights abuses in the United States, particularly related to law enforcement practices. As of October 2025, over 1,000 people have been killed by police officers, marking the twelfth consecutive year of exceeding this grim milestone. These killings often involve excessive use of force. They frequently affect unarmed individuals including those who are mentally ill or just in need of help. This persistent pattern highlights systemic issues within US law enforcement agencies.​

Racial minorities in the US face a higher likelihood of being targeted with lethal force. Although Black Americans make up around 12 percent of the US population, they account for an estimated 20% of those fatally shot by police in 2025. The same applies to the Hispanic population in the US. Police misconduct, disproportionate arrests and use of force against minorities are also common US human rights abuses.

Systemic injustice also extends into the US criminal justice system. Around two million people are imprisoned in the country, and there is an overrepresentation of racial minorities. ICE are conducting violent raids against immigrants, who are then systematically detained for prolonged period, seriously abused, and deported.

America ‘claims’ to uphold human rights

The continuation of the death penalty is also a stain on the US’s human rights record. Several states maintain use of the death penalty, sometimes employing methods such as nitrogen hypoxia criticized internationally as cruel and inhumane. In addition, places such as Guantanamo Bay continue to indefinitely detain individuals, without trial, violating international law. Environmental justice, violence against Indigenous peoples, and the LGBTQ community should also have been brought up in the UPR, if the US had attended, to push for necessary reforms.

The UN Universal Periodic Review is designed to hold all UN member states accountable, regardless of their global power. The US decision not to participate signals its clear refusal to accept external scrutiny. It raises serious questions about its commitment to human rights.

By withdrawing from the UPR, the US also gives other countries with human rights abuses an excuse to follow suit.

The UN Human Rights Council has postponed the US review until November 2026. The Council warned it may take further action if the US continues to refuse cooperation.​",https://www.thecanary.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/US-Human-Rights.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:56:45.532292

On November 7, the United States failed to participate in its UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a process where the human rights record of every member state is reviewed by other states, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported. No UN member state has failed to be reviewed since its creation in 2006.

The US decision to disengage from this vital process is particularly concerning given the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. Since the beginning of its term, the Trump administration has implemented policies that pose significant risks to the human rights of people in the US and around the world.

Recent unlawful attacks on vessels the administration claims are trafficking drugs, the violent campaign of raids and detentions conducted by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials, and the use of excessive force during demonstrations are just some examples of the Trump administration’s blatant violations of international human rights law.

The UN Human Rights Council reacted to the US disengagement by postponing the review until November 2026 and saying it will consider any appropriate action if the US continues to not cooperate.

The UPR was created with the clear purpose of ensuring that every UN member state, regardless of its power and size, undergoes a peer review of its human rights record. It is also a key opportunity for civil society groups to voice their concerns on the international stage, especially where repressive governments undermine freedom of expression and independent monitoring of human rights at the national level.

To support the US peer review, hundreds of US and international civil society organisations, including Human RightsWatch, submitted reports on a wide range of human rights violations, such as: arbitrary detention, abusive treatment of immigrants, regression in sexual and reproductive rights and LGBT rights, systemic racial discrimination, and attacks on fundamental rights and the rule of law. Civil society groups and US local and regional government officials organized several events at the UN to discuss the country’s human rights situation.

According to HRW, the US government seems to think it is an exception and that the universal review process should not apply to it. But if it considers itself a rights-respecting government, international scrutiny aimed at improving the national human rights situation should be considered vital. The Trump administration may avoid this formal scrutiny process for a time, but doing so will only generate international criticism and further erode its place on the world stage.",,N,,2025-11-09 20:57:54.616380

CHICAGO (WGN) – Shots were reportedly fired at U.S. Border Patrol agents during immigration enforcement operations in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago Saturday afternoon.

The Department of Homeland Security claims agents were conducting immigration enforcement operations near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue when an unknown man driving a black Jeep fired shots at agents and drove off.

DHS further alleges a group of people also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicle.

The Chicago Police Department was called in for help and cleared the scene.

CPD said their officers were sent to the area for reports of shots fired at federal agents. Officers secured the scene and there are no reports of anyone hit by gunfire.

One police officer, however, was accidentally hit by a GMC pickup truck driven by a 20-year-old woman. The officer suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital in good condition, while the woman was issued two citations, according to CPD.

The suspect who reportedly fired shots at the agents and the Jeep he was driving have not been found.

Those who live in the area, however, are accusing federal agents of being aggressive.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward) said he asked agents for warrants and identification after hearing they tried to detain a man in a vehicle.

“When we arrived here, there was an 11-year-old little girl dragged by these masked individuals and the neighbors are trying to surround to make sure that they didn’t take her,” he said.

Sigcho-Lopez added that witnesses told him agents broke the window of a car.

“Look at what they’ve done to our community. Since 10 a.m. then and this is sadness. This is outrageous,” he said.

Nexstar’s WGN-TV has reached out to DHS on the incident involving an 11-year-old girl and is awaiting a response.

Once federal agents cleared the area, protesters turned their attention to remaining CPD officer conducting crowd control, yelling “shame” in their direction.

“This incident is not isolated and reflects a growing and dangerous trend of violence and obstruction. Over the past two months, we’ve seen an increase in assaults and obstruction targeting federal law enforcement during operations. These confrontations highlight the dangers our agents face daily and the escalating aggression toward law enforcement. The violence must end,” DHS said.

It’s been two months since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz. Those who live in the area said they’ve had enough.

“I’m asking them to de-escalate. Ilive here. My daughter goes to school here. We went shopping. We’re trying to go shopping. I went to Walgreens. Ridiculous, it’s enough already. This needs to stop,” one protester said.

It’s unclear how many people were detained Saturday.

They quickly detained nine people working outside during the raid, including six women, while kids inside the car wash watched as their mother was taken away. Workers were not allowed to go inside to retrieve their work permits or identification, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made no effort to enter the facility to identify anyone they were arresting. These workers were kidnapped and whisked away in one of the largest workplace ICE raids Massachusetts has ever seen.

Boston is the latest of major cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, targeted by the Trump administration with brutal repression and anti-immigrant crackdowns. Somerville, a small city within the Boston metropolitan area, was the site of the arrest of Rumeysa Ozturk in March, and Boston mayor Michelle Wu was brought to Congress around the same time to testify on its immigration policies. However, the Trump administration started planning a new phase of immigration repression in late August, and ICE arrested over 1,400 people across Massachusetts in September. With the escalation of attacks on different cities and the Supreme Court authorizing the racial profiling of ICE victims, this is sure to continue.

Victims of the car wash kidnapping were taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, MA, where an immigration office building has been turned into an impromptu prison. ICE has denied victims lawyer visits, while failing to provide beds, sinks, or showers to the people they are holding. In addition, only seven of the nine workers kidnapped have been located, and two of the workers say they were denied food and phone calls for over two days.

These abhorrent attacks on the immigrant community are deliberate. The Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the city, with 30 to 50 percent of the population born outside of the United States. ICE is clearly sowing the seeds of intimidation in the city, and chose to target these workers without having access to any warrants or identification.

Despite Boston being a sanctuary city, ICE has been allowed to operate within its borders and has met little to no resistance from local Democratic officials. Congressional representatives have only offered legal assistance to individual victims, an insufficient response given the scale of the repression.

However, over 100 people attended a vigil for the kidnapped workers, organized by local activists affiliated with LUCE, an immigrant justice network with a defense hotline for ICE sightings. While hotlines are crucial to report sightings and document arrests in real time, it’s crucial that we also begin self-organizing independent of Democrats and failed legal strategies in the face of mounting repression. The local labor movement has a large role to play, shown by Boston SEIU members rallying in solidarity with Los Angeles and in defense of David Huerta.",https://www.leftvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/allston-brighton-boston-ice-raid.png,N,,2025-11-09 11:17:00.631598

The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, through a series of new notices and proposed regulations, are giving breaks to giant private equity firms, crypto companies, foreign real estate investors, insurance providers and a variety of multinational corporations.

The primary target: The administration is rapidly gutting a 2022 law intended to ensure that a sliver of the country’s most profitable corporations pay at least some federal income tax. The provision, the corporate alternative minimum tax, was passed by Democrats and signed into law by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It sought to stop corporations like Microsoft, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson from being able to report big profits to shareholders yet low tax liabilities to the federal government. It was projected to raise $222 billion over a decade.

But the succession of notices the Treasury and I.R.S. have issued beginning this summer means the tax could bring in a fraction of that.

These breaks come in addition to the roughly $4 trillion package of tax cuts that President Trump signed into law in July. The legislation, passed entirely by Republicans, heavily benefits businesses and the ultrawealthy. It is projected to add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit and came with steep cuts to health care for the elderly and food stamps for the poorest Americans.

With its various tax relief provisions, the administration is now effectively adding hundreds of billions of dollars in new breaks for big businesses and investors. The Treasury is empowered to write rules to help the I.R.S. carry out tax laws passed by Congress. But the aggressive actions of the Trump administration raise questions about whether it is exceeding its legal authority.

Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked federal workers as instruments of the “deep state,” exercising power beyond anything authorized by the law. Now the administration is doing the same thing, several tax experts said, undermining laws that hit the ultrawealthy and big companies.

“Treasury has clearly been enacting unlegislated tax cuts,” said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. “Congress determines tax law. Treasury undermines this constitutional principle when it asserts more authority over the structure of the tax code than Congress provides it.”

The alternative minimum tax isn’t the administration’s only effort to roll back taxes on large businesses and wealthy individuals. Last month, the Treasury and I.R.S. granted new tax relief to foreign investors in U.S. real estate. In August, they withdrew regulations to prevent multinationals from avoiding taxes by claiming duplicate losses in multiple countries at once. And, as The New York Times previously reported, the Treasury and I.R.S. have rolled back a crackdown on an aggressive tax shelter used by big companies, including Occidental Petroleum and AT&T. That amounts to another $100 billion in cuts — and likely far more, according to tax advisers.

Changes like these are not widely publicized by the Treasury, but are closely followed by tax planners for the country’s biggest corporations — who are applauding the new guidelines. In notes to clients, advisers at KPMG celebrated the new “array of choices” available for investors seeking to avoid the corporate alternative minimum tax. They noted that the Treasury’s moves provided “significant flexibility” for clients to trim their bills, allowing them to “cherry-pick” the rules that best suit their needs.

A Treasury spokesman said the new moves were “a practical approach that supports American investment and competitiveness” and were meant to replace the Biden administration’s “compliance maze that would have buried taxpayers in red tape.” The spokesman did not address the issue of whether the Treasury was exceeding its legal authority.

The Treasury’s actions are probably contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to the federal deficit, tax experts said. That is on top of the trillions that the legislation signed by Mr. Trump in July is already adding to the deficit. Yet unlike laws passed by Congress, Treasury is under no obligation to publicly account for revenue lost by its actions — such as cutting spending to offset the money no longer being collected.

Doing it through the Treasury means “you can just give away the goodies to one group, without having to take back anything from another,” said Daniel Hemel, a law professor at New York University. This loophole, he said, is one “that previous administrations have exploited and which the Trump administration is exploiting more aggressively.”

The actions by Treasury over the past few months are an accelerated version of what the agency did during the first Trump administration: Regulators killed off efforts to crack down on a lucrative estate tax avoidance strategy, and watered down new taxes on multinational companies in the 2017 Republican tax package.

Big companies effectively keep two sets of books — one for investors and another for the I.R.S. The profits they report to the I.R.S. permit various deductions that can bring a firm’s tax rate far below the 21 percent corporate tax rate.

A holy grail of tax planning is figuring out a deduction that businesses can claim on their tax return — but one that they don’t report to investors, which would dent their profits, potentially hurt their stock price and thus depress compensation paid to executives. In 2021, the Biden administration was unable to get Congress to sign on to an international plan to tax multinational corporations. So the Democratic-led Congress revived an old idea to potentially achieve similar results by imposing a tax on the same profits that corporations report to their investors.

That alternative minimum tax was part of a 2022 domestic policy law called the Inflation Reduction Act. The new tax would apply to big corporations with an effective tax rate below 15 percent.

Not everyone viewed the new tax positively. “But it’s a thing that they were able to do at that moment in time,” said Kimberly Clausing, a top Biden administration Treasury tax official, and now a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The original proposal was relatively simple. Limited to a tiny group of corporations averaging profits of more than $1 billion a year, it would require I.R.S. auditors to look at the income reported to shareholders. If the companies paid taxes at a rate of less than 15 percent on those earnings, the new tax would kick in. It would hit as few as 80 corporations, according to one study.

Industry lobbyists swung into action, and Democrats in Congress began carving out enormous exceptions, permitting deductions for, say, businesses investing in heavy machinery and wireless spectrum used by the likes of T-Mobile and Verizon.

As a result of changes like these, the new tax’s projected revenue dropped to $222 billion from $319 billion, according to congressional estimates.

The amount of revenue is expected to shrink even more, in part because of the Treasury’s actions.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that Mr. Trump signed into law in July provided well over $1 trillion in relief for big companies when they calculate their income tax bills. But those breaks didn’t extend to the separate calculation that corporations must make for their alternative minimum tax bill. As a result, the regular tax bills of many businesses promise to drop so sharply — below 15 percent — that they could be newly subject to the alternative minimum tax.

The new law could have swept in two of the biggest crypto firms, Coinbase and Strategy. In response, they sought rule changes for calculating the minimum tax. Three high-powered legal advisers — Michael Desmond, who served as the I.R.S. chief counsel in the first Trump administration; Andrew Strelka, formerly senior tax counsel in the Biden administration; and Eugene Scalia, the labor secretary in the first Trump administration — pushed to exempt “mark to market” gains reported to investors. Those gains reflect the increase in value of the investments held by companies that haven’t been sold yet.

On Sept. 30, the I.R.S. granted their request, explicitly citing “digital assets.” Big crypto companies “have been granted a reprieve,” lawyers at Vedder Price wrote.

Strategy declared within hours that it “no longer expects to become subject to” the minimum tax, after previously disclosing a potential multibillion-dollar bill under the new tax.

Coinbase said in a statement that it supported the Trump administration’s approach to the regulations for administering the minimum tax. Strategy did not respond to a request for comment.

The crypto companies “owe tax and they’re not happy about it, so they’re going to the Trump administration for a special carve-out,” complained Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.

Some energy firms are already benefiting, too. Cheniere Energy, the giant natural gas exporter, disclosed in a securities filing last month that, thanks to the most recent Treasury notice, it was entitled to a refund of $380 million of previously paid alternative minimum tax.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/02/multimedia/02biz-trump-taxcuts-01-jptw/02biz-trump-taxcuts-01-jptw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 11:17:04.555532

Sign up for their newsletter here.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and staff have administered what experts say was shoddy medical treatment to at least a dozen detainees at its Batavia facility in the past two years, Investigative Post has found.

Serious injuries went untreated, medications were denied or scaled back, and needed medical appointments were delayed at the ICE detention center.

In one case, a Nigerian migrant arrived in February at the detention facility suffering frostbite. A doctor who provided emergency care ordered that he see a specialist within a week before releasing him into immigration custody. Agents in Batavia never took him to the appointment. By the time he saw a doctor, it was too late to save his fingers; parts of six were later amputated.

In another case, a Gambian man with numerous heart issues was detained by ICE in February after he showed up for a routine check-in appointment. The man went two weeks without his medications. He suffered a stroke-like syndrome as a result, according to a doctor.

Attorneys and other detainee advocates told Investigative Post that the cases documented by this reporting are indicative of a wider problem. And a 2023 investigation by NPR found similar problems across ICE’s network of detention centers.

Sophie Dalsimer, an attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest who has studied medical treatment in ICE facilities in New York, said the agency’s treatment of detainees amounts to “medical neglect in a legal sense.”

“The lack of medical care, and with ICE being deliberately indifferent to people’s medical needs, could, in many of these instances, rise to the level of a constitutional violation,” she said. “It certainly appears to be a violation of ICE’s own detention standards.”

Those standards include providing prescribed medications, timely responses to medical complaints, and hospitalization as needed.

The Batavia facility lacks a doctor and dentist working on-site. That’s for a 650-bed detention center that’s been overcapacity for months due to the Trump administration’s crackdown on migrants.

A Department of Homeland Security inspector general report published in June noted that “staffing shortages caused delays in dental and off-site specialty care.” Between September 2024 and February 2025, the report said, ICE had a 150-person backlog of detainees who required outside medical treatment and were waiting for appointments.

That problem was noted previously in a 2018 Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigation into medical care at Batavia. That audit gave the facility a passing grade but also found “several examples of detainees waiting for various specialty health care services for more than a month.” In one case, a detainee waited 168 days for an endocrinology appointment. In another case, the auditor found that a detainee requested an outside doctor appointment for blood in his stool, but that ICE deleted the request from its internal system.

“It’s just freak luck that no one has died in Batavia in the last two years,” said Aaron Krupp, the regional coordinator at Justice for Migrant Families. “But the way that they have treated people, people really easily could have died.”

This story is based on a review of nearly 600 pages of court filings from seven lawsuits, medical records, and other documents, as well as interviews with a dozen people including detainees, attorneys and other experts. Neither ICE nor DHS, its parent agency, responded to detailed questions and requests about each case in this story.

Injuries Go Untreated

Chidi Nwagbo moved from Nigeria to the U.S. in 1988, living for 37 years as a “model resident” with no criminal history, according to his attorney. When Donald Trump took office in January, he said in a July interview, “things just went helter-skelter, like raids everywhere, and I didn’t know what to do.”

He made a plan to move to Canada to live with his brother and paid a smuggler $2,000 to shepherd him and three other migrants into Quebec. The final leg of the journey required them to cross the border on foot, but Nwagbo said he was unprepared for freezing temperatures and waist-deep snow. He and a woman in his party eventually called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to rescue them.

After a hospital stint, he was released into federal immigration custody on February 10 with orders from a doctor that he see a specialist at Kessler Burn and Trauma Center in Rochester to treat his frostbitten fingers within a week. ICE never took him to the appointment, according to Nwagbo’s medical records, which he shared with Investigative Post. By the time he saw a different doctor at a different practice 16 days later, his fingers were too far gone. Amputations would be necessary, the doctor told him. He’s now missing portions of six fingers.

“I shouldn’t have lost my fingers,” he said.

The case of Tim, another Nigerian, is similar.

In April this year, Tim, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution against his family, was days away from finishing a federal prison sentence for a fraud conviction when he fell down a set of stairs. He suffered a major concussion and was taken to a Massachusetts hospital. Upon discharge, he was prescribed nine drugs, ordered to attend in-patient physical therapy, and transferred to the Batavia detention center. Once at the detention center, he went at least a month without medication and received only two physical therapy sessions before being deported this summer. By that point, Tim required a walker.

“I’m very traumatized at the moment,” he said during an interview with Investigative Post in May, several weeks after his injury. “I suffer a lot of mental health issues. I cannot sleep. I am on zero medications.”

Reached recently by email, Tim said his condition has only deteriorated since his return to Nigeria.

He wrote, “I am dire need of a comprehensive mental health/neurological treatment in order to get my life back to where it used to be before my detention in the United States.”

Medications denied

ICE, in some cases, denied detainees access to needed medications. In other cases, the agency allowed lapses in their medication schedules.

That was the case with Sering Ceesay, the Gambian man with heart conditions. He was detained by ICE in New York City on February 19 after what he expected to be a routine immigration appointment.

Instead, ICE placed him in shackles and chains and transported him to Batavia. He went two weeks without his medications. On March 4, he attended a legal clinic hosted by attorneys from the legal advocates at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, who quickly realized Ceesay needed medical attention, according to court filings.

“I was feeling very weak, and my entire body just hurt,” Ceesay said in a filing. “I felt like when I had my heart attacks.”

U.S. District Judge Lawrence Vilardo later ordered Ceesay released, but not before he was diagnosed with a stroke-like syndrome because he had missed so many days of his medicine.

“Without … strict adherence to these medications, [Ceesay] is likely to suffer from recurrent heart attacks, worsening peripheral artery disease and strokes and increasing his risk of further disability and avoidable premature death,” Dr. Joseph Shin, a physician and professor with Weill Cornell Medicine, wrote in a letter submitted as part of Ceesay’s lawsuit.

In Owen Simms’s case, ICE provided him with medication but lowered his dosages, he said, leaving him at risk of a seizure.

An extensive immigration and criminal history landed Simms in the Batavia detention center last March, where he remained until he was transferred to an out-of-state ICE facility in October. During a previous deportation to his home country, Jamaica, Simms was struck in the head with a machete, he and his wife testified in immigration court filings, which left him suffering from seizures. An immigration judge later ruled that he should not be deported due to the likelihood he’d be attacked again if he returned to Jamaica.

In an interview, Simms said his detention by ICE caused him to miss several days of his anti-seizure medication. He said the agency then lowered his daily dosage from 1,500 mg to 1,000 mg. He now worries he’ll suffer another seizure, which in the past has put him in a coma.

“My seizures come on to me when I’m sleeping, and if you’re not next to me, you can’t even know that I am having a seizure,” he said. “It’s scary, like it’s really scary.”

Five other detainees have claimed that ICE denied or delayed them receiving prescribed medication. ICE’s standards call for all detainees to be provided prescribed medications, including a week’s supply before a deportation.

In March 2024, an ICE transfer from Florida to Batavia caused Raheem Fulton, a Jamaican immigrant suffering from end-stage renal disease, to miss a regularly scheduled dialysis appointment. He went five days without the treatment and had to be rushed to the Erie County Medical Center. A spokesperson for RFK Human Rights said ICE caused additional lapses in his dialysis treatment in the past and delayed other medical appointments too. Attorneys for the group are currently suing ICE and have alleged the agency has delayed other treatments Fulton needs, including a cardiology appointment. (Fulton’s lawyers are appealing to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after a Buffalo judge dismissed it in January, agreeing with the government’s argument that the court lacked jurisdiction.)

In October 2024, ICE attempted, unsuccessfully, to deport Naim Qasemi to his native Afghanistan. Against its protocols, ICE failed to provide Qasemi with medications for his diagnosed bipolar disorder, his attorneys allege in a lawsuit to stop his deportation. Qasemi, they wrote, “was unmedicated and was not receiving any kind of therapeutic treatment in advance of his removal.” In court filings, Justice Department officials did not address Qasemi’s claim. A judge dismissed the case last month after Afghanistan cleared Qasemi’s return, paving the way for his deportation.

In a July letter to ICE officials in Batavia, advocates with Justice for Migrant Families wrote that a Honduran man was not receiving a prescribed medical cream to treat a skin condition. The man also suffers from chronic pain, and ibuprofen was no longer working, Jennifer Connor, the organization’s executive director, and Krupp wrote. They demanded ICE take the man to a specialist and administer a different pain medication. Krupp said that hasn’t happened.

Arzou Hami, an Iranian woman suffering from “serious mental health issues” was detained in June, as part of a sweep of Iranian migrants shortly after the U.S. bombed Iran. Matthew Borowski, her attorney, alleged in court filings that her detention has prevented her from receiving medications. She was detained by Buffalo ICE agents at the Niagara County Jail before being transferred to Texas where “she is being denied adequate mental health care,” Borowski wrote in a court filing. In an interview, he said his client has now gotten “some medication, but it’s not the same thing that she was on before.” Officials have not responded to those claims in court yet; the case was transferred to Texas last month.

In a fifth case, a detainee known only as K.U. in court filings alleged he has not received proper medical care for “numerous life-threatening health conditions.” His lawsuit states an independent physician reviewed the man’s case and “expressed extreme concern that he is ‘not receiving the standard of appropriate medical care.’” Officials have yet to address his medical claims in court, and a judge ordered him released in August.

In yet another case, a Jordanian named Mohammed Saleh had treatment for a massive brain tumor and a chronic eye condition delayed by ICE between the fall of 2023 and his deportation later that year

He arrived in Batavia in September 2023 following a federal prison sentence for his involvement in a failed bombing plot in the 1990s and began complaining of “tingling sensations in his fingers and toes” several weeks later. An MRI and a CT scan revealed the tumor. Krupp, of Justice for Migrant Families, said Saleh eventually attended follow-up appointments for his tumor but was only given ibuprofen and Tylenol as treatment. Saleh also had a prescribed injection for his eye condition delayed by three months.

Harmed While in Custody

Some detainees were not properly treated for an injury or illness they suffered while detained.

Lansine Sidibe, a Malian man, alleged he was beaten by seven guards at the Batavia facility in February 2024 after he refused to sign some paperwork. According to a human rights complaint his attorneys filed with the Department of Homeland Security’s office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in December, he alleged the guards broke his fingers, a claim an ICE doctor denied, according to the complaint. Nonetheless, it took a month before the agency agreed to X-ray his fingers.

Renny Arcaya-Ventura, a Venezuelan man, said in an interview that he suffered a severe allergic reaction and body pains after he was booked into the ICE facility and didn’t receive adequate medical care.

“I am in intense pain every day,” he said. “Every day I have a fever, pains in my body [and] I can’t even walk. I have even lost a lot of weight.”

His attorney, Guanlin Yang, shared photos of Arcaya-Ventura that appear to show swelling in his hands and rashes on his arms.

Arcaya-Ventura was deported in August.

Dalsimer, of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, has studied medical care at the Orange County Jail — the second largest ICE detention facility in New York. Through her research and legal work, she’s concluded that medical care offered by ICE is “almost always subpar.”

“The abuses are consistent,” she said, “across all the facilities.”",https://centralcurrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/batavia2-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-11-09 10:17:33.830427

The line between immigration enforcement and racial policing has vanished.","When President Donald Trump invoked an 18th-century wartime law to deport 252 Venezuelan men to a Salvadoran mega-prison, the images of rows of shackled migrants shaved bald and forced to kneel were meant to project control and dominance.

His administration called it a national-security triumph. In truth, it was a chilling statement of values: that people’s lives can be upended and destroyed without a shred of evidence that they pose any threat to the nation.

It revealed a government willing to tear families apart and ship people across borders not because of what they had done, but because of what they symbolized — a convenient target for political theater.

The deportations were not about danger or security; they were about power, and the ease with which it can be exercised over those deemed expendable.

The men deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center were accused of being gang members in “irregular warfare” against the United States, yet The New York Times found that most had no serious criminal record.

Their testimonies of beatings, sexual assault, and simulated drownings, verified by forensic experts as credible evidence of torture, revealed how far the administration was willing to go in the name of deterrence. This was not about public safety. It was about redefining immigration itself as a crime—and, by extension, treating entire communities as suspects.

The cruelty was not confined to that prison.

Days after the Times report, The Washington Post described another mass rupture: more than 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States lost their Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Overnight, people who had built stable lives—who worked, paid taxes, raised children, and contributed to their neighborhoods—became deportable. They lost work permits, driver’s licenses, and access to health care. Activist Adelys Ferro called it “the largest mass illegalization of a group in this country’s history.”

Together, these stories capture a core truth about the Trump era’s immigration strategy: it is not only a campaign against undocumented immigrants. It is a campaign against immigrant belonging itself. It weaponizes uncertainty, turns lawful presence into temporary privilege, and sends the message that no immigrant—regardless of status—is truly safe.

Trump’s immigration agenda has always relied on performance. The mass raids, the footage of families separated at the border, the declarations of “invasions” from Latin America—all serve to create an atmosphere of siege. The Salvadoran prison operation and the revocation of TPS for Venezuelans are extensions of the same logic. They transform policy into theater, where punishment substitutes for problem-solving and fear itself becomes the instrument of control.

For millions of immigrants—documented and undocumented alike—the impact has been pervasive and personal.

Families that once felt secure under TPS or DACA now live in limbo, rechecking expiration dates on work permits and scanning headlines for the next legal reversal. Green-card holders wonder whether their relatives will ever be allowed to join them.

Even naturalized citizens feel the stigma: they are stopped, profiled, and questioned more aggressively at airports, or told to “go back” in the towns where they’ve lived for decades.

This climate has eroded basic civic participation.

Parents skip parent-teacher conferences for fear of encountering law enforcement. Workers avoid reporting wage theft or unsafe conditions, knowing that retaliation could come in the form of a call to ICE. Domestic-violence survivors hesitate to seek protection orders because court buildings have become de facto immigration checkpoints.

Public health officials report that vaccination rates and prenatal care visits have dropped in immigrant neighborhoods since 2024, as families withdraw from every system that keeps them visible.

Fear works not only on the undocumented. It seeps outward, marking every brown or Black body as potentially foreign. Immigration enforcement has become inseparable from over-policing in communities of color.

Federal task forces and local police collaborations blur the line between immigration law and criminal law, subjecting Latino and Black residents to pretextual stops, raids, and warrantless detentions.

A person’s accent, skin tone, or zip code can now determine whether they are treated as neighbor or threat.

At its core, immigration policy is about who is recognized as part of “the people.”

When that recognition becomes conditional—dependent on paperwork, politics, or presidential whim—trust in government dissolves. Communities that once sought partnership with local police or city officials now feel hunted by them.

Faith leaders in Texas, California, and Illinois describe congregants too afraid to attend services because ICE vehicles park nearby. Social-service providers in Florida say families are disappearing overnight, leaving apartments unlocked and paychecks uncollected.

This collapse of trust has consequences far beyond immigration. Law enforcement depends on witnesses willing to come forward. Public health depends on patients seeking care. Schools depend on parent engagement.

When people are driven underground, everyone’s safety suffers. Crimes go unreported, outbreaks spread unchecked, and classrooms lose students whose parents have fled.

The administration’s claim that ending TPS will restore order ignores the reality that TPS recipients were order: they were legal workers filling essential jobs, taxpayers sustaining local economies, and volunteers anchoring civic life. Removing that foundation destabilizes the very communities that politicians claim to protect.

What we are witnessing is not just an immigration crackdown—it is a racial project. The administration’s rhetoric about “invasions,” “criminal aliens,” and “foreign terrorists” resurrects an old hierarchy in which whiteness defines Americanness. By casting entire nationalities as security threats, Trump revives the logic of the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment, and Operation Wetback. The Salvadoran prison images evoke a colonial tableau: brown bodies disciplined into submission for the comfort of a domestic audience.

This racialized spectacle reinforces other hierarchies. In Memphis and Chicago, federal “safe-city” task forces have targeted Black neighborhoods under the guise of crime control, using the same militarized tactics honed at the border. In Los Angeles, ICE raids on Latino workplaces and day-laborer sites have led families to skip doctor visits and school events. The line between immigration enforcement and racial policing has vanished. Communities of color are treated as testing grounds for policies that erode constitutional rights for everyone.

Perhaps the most disturbing element of the Trump approach is its contempt for due process. The Venezuelans deported to El Salvador were given little or no hearing before being branded as “terrorists.” TPS was terminated despite clear statutory and humanitarian grounds for extension. Immigration courts are buried under more than four million pending cases, with many respondents unrepresented and proceedings held by video in makeshift facilities. Detention centers overflow, their conditions described by federal judges as “obviously unconstitutional.”

This erosion of procedure undermines the rule of law itself. When the state can deport without hearing, detain without charge, and torture without accountability, it ceases to act as a lawful government and begins to act as an occupying force. And when these tactics are normalized against immigrants, they set a precedent that can be used against anyone. The border is not a fixed place—it is an idea that can expand inward.

Yet amid the fear, there is resilience. Cities like Bridgeport, Connecticut, have passed resolutions demanding transparency from ICE and pledging to protect immigrant residents. Legal-aid groups are mounting challenges to the misuse of the Alien Enemies Act and to the termination of TPS. Churches are offering sanctuary again, reviving an old moral tradition of civil disobedience. These acts of resistance remind us that immigration policy is not an abstraction—it is the sum of choices made at every level of government, from the courthouse to the city council.

But local resistance alone cannot fix what is fundamentally a federal moral failure. Congress must codify pathways to permanence for TPS and DACA holders, fund independent oversight of detention facilities, and prohibit the use of foreign prisons in immigration enforcement. Courts must reassert that wartime powers cannot be repurposed to bypass asylum law. And civil society—from journalists to educators—must continue exposing the human cost of policies that hide behind bureaucratic euphemisms.

For those who believe these policies affect only “illegal immigrants,” the lesson of history is clear: rights denied to one group rarely stop there. Every expansion of executive power to detain, surveil, or deport without trial eventually ensnares others. The Patriot Act was sold as a counter-terrorism tool; it ended up monitoring millions of citizens. Today’s mass deportations and foreign detentions could become tomorrow’s template for domestic dissent.

Communities of color understand this intimately because they have lived it before. From COINTELPRO to stop-and-frisk, the pattern is familiar: fear is invoked, exceptions are carved out, and the exceptions become the rule. Immigrants are simply the current frontier of that project.

If America continues down this path, it risks more than its moral standing—it risks the integrity of its democracy. A society that governs by humiliation cannot sustain equal justice. A government that builds legitimacy through cruelty cannot command consent. When law becomes a weapon against the vulnerable, it loses its authority over the powerful.

The alternative is not naïve idealism. It is pragmatic decency. Enforcement can exist within bounds that respect dignity and the rule of law. The United States has the capacity to process asylum claims efficiently, to renew TPS when conditions demand it, and to integrate newcomers who strengthen communities rather than destabilize them. What is missing is political courage—the will to replace spectacle with substance.

We should remember that every immigrant policy sends two messages: one to those arriving, and another to those already here. The first declares what kind of country we are; the second declares what kind of citizens we will be. When cruelty becomes normalized, it shapes not only how we treat others but how we imagine ourselves.

Trump’s immigration policies have inflicted fear and trauma far beyond the border. They have hollowed trust, divided neighbors, and licensed racial scapegoating as governance. But they have also forced a reckoning. The question is no longer whether we can secure the border. It is whether we can secure our conscience.

America’s strength has never been measured by its ability to punish the desperate. It has been measured by its capacity for fairness—by the courage to uphold rights even when fear is loudest. The Venezuelans sent to a foreign prison, the families losing TPS, the communities raided in Chicago and Los Angeles—they are not outsiders to the American story. They are its test.

The measure of a democracy is not the power to deport, but the power to protect. And right now, that measure is failing.

,Human Rights,2025-11-09 12:01:19+00:00,CBC,Advocates concerned temporary immigration cuts don't address systemic issues - CBC,"Matthew Robertson, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/impacts-federal-government-carney-temporary-immigration-9.6971297,"The cuts are being made to the temporary foreign worker program and the international student program.
The TFW program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill positions that are unable to be filled by Canadians.
The program also prevents temporary foreign workers from pursuing permanent residency because they are seen as “low-skilled,” she said.
Last year, after the federal government placed a cap on international students, institutions struggled to fill the financial gap.
“Targeting international students without addressing the real issue of funding in post-secondary is a short-sighted approach,” said Fairweather.","The Carney government’s first budget will significantly reduce the number of temporary immigrants it admits to Canada over the next three years.

The cuts are being made to the temporary foreign worker program and the international student program. The 2026 target for temporary foreign worker (TFW) arrivals is now 60,000, down from the 82,000 the government announced last year, and the international student target is now 150,000, down from 305,900.

The move aligns with the tougher stance the Carney government has made on immigration compared to his predecessor, Justin Trudeau.

During a conversation at the Canadian Club in Toronto on Friday, Carney mentioned that in 2018 temporary residents were about three per cent of Canada's population, and by the time he became prime minister they made up 7.5 per cent.

“That is an enormous shift in a very short period of time, and far exceeded our ability to welcome people and make sure that they had good housing and services,” said Carney.

The TFW program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill positions that are unable to be filled by Canadians.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has said he wants the federal government to scrap the program entirely, saying it has led to increased youth unemployment by importing cheap labour.

""The Liberals have to answer: Why is it that they are shutting our own youth out of jobs and replacing them with low-wage, temporary foreign workers from poor countries who are ultimately being exploited?"" he said in September.

But Lynn Bueckert, the secretary business manager for the Hospital Employees' Union in B.C., said in a statement that foreign workers are filling critical positions — “sustaining the system, not draining it.”

Marisa Berry Mendez, a campaigner with the francophone wing of Amnesty International Canada, said the TFW cuts do not address the exploitative nature of the program.

A report from Amnesty International called on the federal government to overhaul the TFW program and Tomoya Obokata, a special rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Office, called the program “a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery.”

The top occupations for temporary foreign workers are in agriculture, often as general farm workers or harvesting labourers.

Berry Mendez said the root of the problem is that the TFW visa ties the worker to their employer. The program also prevents temporary foreign workers from pursuing permanent residency because they are seen as “low-skilled,” she said.

“If they’re in a situation of abuse then they’re pretty much trapped,” she said.

During the process of assembling the Amnesty International report, Berry Mendez said she heard stories of wage theft, unsafe living and working conditions, verbal abuse, sexual abuse and violence.

Bueckert wants to see a “federal pathway to permanent residency for health-care workers,” and Berry Mendez said permanent immigration should be used to meet the “vast majority of labour market demands.”

The cuts to international students could have a significant impact on the resources of post-secondary institutions, said Annabree Fairweather, the executive director of the Confederation of University Faculty Associations of B.C.

In Canada, undergraduate international students were expected to pay an average of $41,746 in tuition this school year, compared with $7,734 for domestic students.

Universities and colleges across the country have increasingly relied upon international students for funding. Provincial funding to universities fell from 60.7 per cent in 2008-09 to 44.8 per cent in 2022-23. The average was weighed down by Ontario, whose public funding fell from 54.3 per cent in 2008-09 to 32.5 per cent in 2022-23.

Last year, after the federal government placed a cap on international students, institutions struggled to fill the financial gap. The Council of Ontario Universities projected a financial loss of $300 million for last school year, and worsening losses in the years following.

Post-secondary institutions have had to reduce costs by cutting programs and teaching positions. Conestoga College, based in Kitchener, Ont., cut several programs days before the start of the school year, and said it will axe around 80 programs before next fall.

Wasiimah Joomun, the executive director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, said cuts are widespread in post-secondary education.

“At the institution level, even at the student union level, they are now having conversations about what are the core services that we do absolutely need to provide and what are the core services we can let go,” said Joomun.

Fairweather said the reduction in resources has negative effects on both students and faculty. Cuts to staff mean larger class sizes and less administrative support, causing work to be downloaded on remaining instructors.

“That work distribution is contributing to, honestly, a real crisis of burnout and the faculty being unable to deliver the kinds of quality education that they have traditionally been able to offer students,” said Fairweather.

Both Fairweather and Joomun said federal and provincial governments need to reassess how they fund education in order to make up for the shortfall the reduction of international student tuition causes.

“Targeting international students without addressing the real issue of funding in post-secondary is a short-sighted approach,” said Fairweather.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0c4da258-0e4d-4b45-a94b-08072f98e7bb,1762461433755/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C322%2C7972%2C4484%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-09 07:17:08.514905

Lawsuits against private prison operators could discourage companies from helping Trump carry out his policies, amounting to “judicial gum in the works of democracy,” Geo says.
The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in the case, The Geo Group v. Menocal, on Monday.
Geo is America’s largest private prison operator and the biggest jailer of immigrants for ICE.
Now, a range of similar lawsuits are pending against Geo and its main competitor in the private prison business, CoreCivic.","At a for-profit immigrant prison in Colorado, prisoners say they were threatened with solitary confinement if they refused to work as unpaid janitors, cleaning common areas of the facility for free. Rather than hiring—and paying—regular employees to do the work, the company allegedly boosted its profits by making the immigrants do it instead.

“We are not slaves. We are detainees. And we should not be forced to clean. That’s wrong,” Alejandro Menocal, an immigrant who was held in the Aurora, Colorado, facility and is now suing the prison company, testified in a deposition.

Across the country, for-profit prison companies are facing similar lawsuits, alleging that they violate the federal law banning forced labor, as well as state minimum-wage laws, by coercing immigrant prisoners to work either for free or for just a dollar a day.

Now the company that runs that Colorado prison, the Geo Group, is asking the Supreme Court for help. It says it needs immunity from lawsuits like Menocal’s. Much as the government enjoys sovereign immunity from some suits, Geo believes it is similarly entitled to immunity as a government contractor.

If the company does not have protection from these lawsuits, Geo argues, opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies could wage a “proxy war” against it. Lawsuits against private prison operators could discourage companies from helping Trump carry out his policies, amounting to “judicial gum in the works of democracy,” Geo says.

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in the case, The Geo Group v. Menocal, on Monday. Lined up against Geo are some unusual allies, including a major public-sector union, the conservative think-tank Cato Institute, the good-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington—and the Trump administration itself, which argues that private prison companies may deserve immunity but this case isn’t the right way to give it to them.

The Supreme Court’s decision could not only determine whether the immigrant prisoners will ever get their day in court, it could make it harder for anyone to sue government contractors—creating a category of companies that, opponents fear, would be above the law.

The case against the Geo Group stretches back more than a decade, when a group of immigrants who had been locked up at the company’s Aurora facility claimed that Geo’s requirement for them to clean the prison’s common areas—in addition to cleaning their personal spaces, which they didn’t object to—amounted to unlawful forced labor.

Geo is America’s largest private prison operator and the biggest jailer of immigrants for ICE. It operates both traditional prisons, which hold people accused or convicted of crimes, and immigrant prisons, holding people not because they are accused of any crime but because they are waiting for their immigration cases to be resolved. After President Trump’s election, Geo’s stock rocketed up by 65 percent. The company is in line for billions of dollars in new contracts as ICE’s budget balloons under the Trump administration.

ICE pays Geo millions of dollars a year to run the Aurora prison. “But GEO didn’t perform the work itself: It required those detained in its facility to do it,” the immigrant plaintiffs wrote in their Supreme Court filing. “The company forced every person detained at Aurora to perform unpaid janitorial work, sending them to ‘the hole’—solitary confinement—if they refused.”

The plaintiffs say that, inside the prison, immigrants were well aware of Geo’s for-profit status and how they were being used to boost the company’s bottom line. But with the threat of solitary confinement forever looming, they felt they didn’t have much choice but to do the free labor.

“I was scared of going to the hole. Being in detention is already scary, and the hole is so much worse,” Olga Alexakhina, one of those held at the Aurora prison, testified.

Another former prisoner, Hugo Hernandez-Ceren, said that people returning from solitary seemed shattered. “They were really skinny; they had lost a lot of weight. They wouldn’t talk to other people anymore. They seemed afraid. They—they became antisocial,” he said in a deposition.

With the consequences for dissent so severe, prisoners often relented to the guards’ demands that they clean, despite their objections to doing free work for their for-profit jailer. Hernandez-Ceren said he saw one prisoner tell a guard “that he was going to not clean because he was no janitor and that he was not being paid for that type of job and that they had to hire someone to do that.” In response, according to Hernandez-Ceren, the guard took out a bag and said, “Just pack your stuff because you’re going to go to the hole.” That was enough of a threat. The prisoner “started cleaning right away,” Hernandez-Ceren said.

The plaintiffs argue that this violates a federal law that prohibits obtaining a person’s labor by means of force or certain threats of harm. Geo denies it has done anything wrong, and it says it carefully follows the requirements of its contracts with ICE.

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

In addition to requiring prisoners to clean common areas for free, the company also employs prisoners, usually for a dollar a day, to do a variety of other work in its prisons. “We ran the facility—the landscape, the laundry, the kitchen, we washed the floor,” Menocal said in court filings. And while these dollar-a-day jobs were voluntary—prisoners were not sent to solitary if they refused—the litigants argue they were still coerced into doing the work. The food that Geo provided was inadequate, leaving them “chronically hungry,” they say, and giving them no choice but to buy more from the commissary. And to buy food, they needed money. So they worked for whatever Geo would pay them.

“They were using us like slaves. One dollar a day. Unfair. Treating us like dirt,” Menocal said.

These dollar-a-day work programs are widespread and have “subsidized the private prison industry model,” according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. With prisoners working for so little, “they don’t have to have to hire as many people to staff the facility,” he said.

Now, a range of similar lawsuits are pending against Geo and its main competitor in the private prison business, CoreCivic.

In Washington State, immigrants who had worked for a dollar a day in a Geo Group facility sued the company for violating the state’s minimum-wage law. They went to trial and won, with a jury ordering Geo to pay more than $17 million in back pay and a court docking the company another $5.9 million in unjust enrichment. An appeals court upheld the judgment, explaining that because of the dollar-a-day workers, “Geo operated its facility with just a handful of full-time staff hired from the local area, thereby saving millions of dollars that it would otherwise have spent on payroll.”

At the Supreme Court on Monday, the issue is not whether these work programs violate forced labor or minimum-wage laws—in most of the cases, that is still to be decided by lower courts—but instead a narrower legal question that could have wide-ranging implications: What kind of immunity does a contractor like the Geo Group have, and when can Geo raise it in court?

Geo argues that it should be able to assert immunity right away and get out of the lawsuit at the earliest possible moment. It believes that as long as it properly followed the instructions of the federal government, it cannot be sued for its actions.

Geo’s argument rests on the idea of “derivative sovereign immunity.” Sovereign immunity is the rule, dating back to the British monarchy, that the government cannot be sued without its consent. Congress has passed laws that allow for lawsuits against the federal government in some circumstances but not others. Derivative sovereign immunity is similar. The idea is that if the government was legally entitled to pursue some action without the threat of a lawsuit, that immunity should extend to any outside contractor hired to pursue the same action on the government’s behalf.

“While the government’s sovereign immunity prevents those who disagree with federal immigration policy from suing the government directly, contractors like Geo are regularly subject to suits that drive up their costs,” Geo told the Supreme Court.

The lower court denied Geo’s claim of immunity. The company appealed, but the appellate court decided that it was too soon for Geo to raise the immunity issue, saying that it would have to wait until the final resolution of the case to appeal. Now, at the Supreme Court, Geo argues that waiting until then would defeat the point of having immunity in the first place.

Geo’s opponents say that private companies don’t get the government’s immunity from being sued. Instead, they say that if contractors act legally and follow the government’s instructions properly, they can raise that as a defense. The difference between an immunity and a defense is key: An immunity would mean that contractors could avoid lawsuits entirely—if someone sues them, they could get out of it right away—while a defense would usually mean that the contractor, like anyone else, could be sued and would have to go through litigation, possibly including discovery and a trial, before a court would ultimately decide whether its defense would win the day. If the contractor only has a defense rather than immunity, then the plaintiffs could still make their case in court.

Geo’s opponents argue that giving contractors immunity misses the point of immunity in the first place—which, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, is to let the government do what it believes is in the public interest without being constantly hauled into court. But a for-profit company acts in its private interest, not in the public interest. Geo’s “drastic expansion of sovereign immunity,” the group wrote in a court filing, is “contrary to the public’s interest in a responsive and efficient government animated solely by the need to serve the American people.”

Even the Trump administration has come out against Geo, although in a more limited way. It argues that contractor immunity should be decided by Congress or a special rulemaking body, not in a court decision.

The outcome of the Supreme Court case will likely affect more than only the forced labor and minimum-wage lawsuits against Geo. One brief in support of the immigrants warned that Geo’s theory would “weaken accountability for violations of individual liberties,” making it harder, if not impossible, for people whose rights were violated by private contractors to hold those companies accountable.

That includes any kind of contractor, not just prison operators. “Insulating private government contractors from liability to those they have harmed will only erode accountability,” a public employee union said in a brief supporting the immigrants. The Supreme Court’s decision in the case is expected by July.",https://images.newrepublic.com/8742572062a6c4d95d9306e739170e623606e2f4.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-11-09 10:56:31.771264

Last month Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood admitted her department is “not yet fit for purpose”. The disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act that so few convictions have been secured by Immigration Enforcement against small boat pilots and passengers has hiked pressure on the Prime Minister.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: “Someone tell Keir Starmer it is illegal to cross the Channel illegally. These figures lay bare the collapse of border enforcement under Labour.

“Even more staggering, not a single person was convicted under Section 25 for facilitating illegal entry, the law designed to target smugglers. Meanwhile, convicted offenders from countries like Albania, Sudan, Iraq, and Iran are still being housed at taxpayers’ expense instead of being deported.

“This is what happens when you put human rights lawyers in charge of border control. The British people deserve a system that actually enforces the law.”

Of the 30 convicted pilots, 11 were from Sudan; four were from Iran and three were Palestinian. And of the 38 passengers, the greatest number were from Albania (seven), followed by Iraq (five) and Afghanistan and Vietnam (both four). The figures do not take account of the work of the National Crime Agency.

Setting out how he would tackle small boats crisis, Mr Philp said the Tories would “leave the ECHR, remove all illegal immigrants within a week of arrival” and “end the merry-go-round of appeals”. He claimed the Prime Minister “doesn’t have the backbone to do this”.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The information set out in the FOI relates only to convictions obtained by Immigration Enforcement in the first six months of this year and does not represent the activity taken across law enforcement to tackle this threat. We are taking decisive action to dismantle the organised criminal networks behind small boat crossings which danger lives and compromise UK border security.”

The Home Secretary is expected to announce an overhaul of the asylum and immigration system this month with officials studying Denmark’s tougher rules on family reunion and its policy of only allowing most refugees temporary residency.

Reform UK MP Lee Anderson responded to the Immigration Enforcement figures, saying Labour was betraying Britain by failing to protect borders.

He said: “This is yet another staggering display of incompetence and deceit from this Labour Government. Instead of cracking down on illegal activity, their solution is simply to make it legal.

But while crossings have slowed, border advocates say the human toll of migration has not.

According to CBP, illegal crossings in September fell to 26,002 nationwide, marking a 93% decrease from the peak of President Joe Biden's administration. Officials also reported zero parole releases for the fifth consecutive month, crediting enforcement measures for what they called “the most secure border in American history.”

Despite the progress federal officials describe, members of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) in El Paso are using the Day of the Dead season to remind the public of those who have lost their lives seeking safety or opportunity in the United States.

“What we are doing here in our community is remembering the people who have died along the U.S.-México border,” said Alan Lizárraga, a spokesperson for BNHR.

The organization built a series of small altars this week to honor migrants who died during their journeys north. While CBP has not yet released an official figure for migrant deaths this fiscal year, hundreds have died in recent years, often due to heat exposure and dehydration in remote desert areas.

Lizárraga says that even as migration slows, the dangers persist and may even increase due to stricter enforcement policies.

“We believe that migrant deaths and the policies that we have have a direct correlation,” he said. “We are seeing policies pushing people to take alternative routes that are dangerous because of the terrain and conditions they go through.”

The BNHR also highlights concerns over deaths of those in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, 18 people have died in ICE custody over the past year, twelve of them between December 2023 and September 2024, with causes ranging from leukemia and strokes to suicide.

“Regardless of whether migration is high or low, we still have a system that doesn’t care about their lives,” Lizárraga said. “We are spending so much money militarizing the border instead of fixing a broken immigration and asylum system.”

Sample of Portland, Oregon, declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.

“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample. “They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.”

The archbishop’s statement — posted in both English and Spanish on the archdiocesan website and the archbishop’s social media platforms, along with a video version of the message — follows months of immigration raids and arrests under President Donald Trump‘s crackdown on immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the U.S., a group known to be majority Catholic Christians.

“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample. “This is due to the increased ICE activity within our communities, even now in the vicinity of some of our parishes.”

Upheaval in Portland amid ICE activity

Oregon has become one of several flashpoints for tensions over the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, with regular protests taking place outside the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“I want to assure our Hispanic brothers and sisters that the shepherds of the church in the United States are working diligently to advocate for their humane and respectful treatment. We are doing all that we can to alleviate this suffering,” said Archbishop Sample, who noted he is currently attending the annual U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops‘ fall plenary meeting in Baltimore.

Both Portland, Oregon’s largest city, and the state government have codified their sanctuary status, prohibiting their respective law enforcement personnel from assisting any federal agency with immigration enforcement.

In September, Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the building. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon sued, with U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — temporarily blocking the deployment of the troops in an October order made permanent Nov. 7.

More than 200 individuals residing in Oregon have been detained by ICE officers since Trump took office, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the farmworker advocacy organization PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), during an Oct. 31 press conference in Portland.

Several North Portland public schools have implemented “secure the perimeter” protocols — locking all exterior doors while continuing learning activities — in response to reported ICE activity. On Nov. 6, some 100 community members surrounded César Chávez School an hour ahead of dismissal to watch out for ICE officers during student pickup.

Catholic teaching on immigration, deportation

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) — both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

He underscored their moral severity in “Veritatis Splendor” by calling them examples of “intrinsic evil,” explaining that, no matter the motives, these acts are “not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person.”

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief.

Nationwide: 1 in 6 Catholics potentially directly affected by ICE activity

The report found one in six Catholics (18%) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to a Pew Research Center data analysis from March 2025, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%). But eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of an immigrant (22%), while 92% of Asian Catholics are either immigrants (78%) or are the children of an immigrant (14%). Far fewer white Catholics — just 15% — share this immigrant experience: only 6% were born outside the U.S., with another 9% born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent.

“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.

The archbishop assured them he was “deeply concerned over what you are experiencing right now, along with all of your local parish priests. I know this is a great burden for them as well, because they feel helpless to take this cross from you. … Please know that I and your pastors stand with you in solidarity during this difficult time.”

Archbishop Sample also addressed priests “who are caring for people during these difficult times,” promising his “support and prayers.”

“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.

“He alone is our hope, and in him alone do we trust. He is with you always and will never abandon you,” said the archbishop. “Place yourselves in his hands.”

Portland archbishop’s message concludes with ‘Viva Cristo Rey’

Archbishop Sample concluded his message with “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Jesus Christ!”) — the battle cry of the Cristeros, who defied the anti-Catholic, secular government of Mexico during the Cristero War of 1926-1929. The Cristeros’ defiant cry was made famous in particular by Blessed Miguel Pro. The Mexican martyr and Jesuit priest extended his arms in the form of a cross and shouted those words before he was executed by firing squad in 1927.

The high court in Johannesburg has ordered an anti-migrant vigilante group to stop blocking foreigners from entering government health facilities and schools, actions it said were unconstitutional.

The group, named Operation Dudula from the Zulu for “force out”, was founded in 2021. Its self-described mandate is to remove African migrants – by force, if necessary – from the country. It blames them for South Africa’s rampant crime, inequality and unemployment.

Some politicians have capitalised on and stoked xenophobia in the country, which has a history of extreme violence towards black African foreigners.

Judge Leicester Adams ruled that Dudula must stop spreading hate speech and stop evicting foreign nationals from their homes or stalls. He also said the police cannot search foreigners’ homes without a warrant, and must have a clear reason to believe someone is in the country illegally before asking for identification.

In two of South Africa’s provinces, Dudula members stopped people they suspected of being foreign nationals from accessing hospitals, demanding they produce identification.

In response, rights groups including Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia and Abahlali baseMjondolo took the group to court in 2023.

The national immigration and police departments, who have been accused of aiding Operation Dudula, were also named as respondents. Dudula did not oppose the court application. The judge noted that “they were aware of it and decided to ignore the court proceedings”.

Abahlali’s Mqapheli Bonono told The Continent what Dudula was doing was clearly illegal. But they weren’t stopped by police, private security or hospital management, who Bonono said were complicit. Kopanang’s media organiser Mike Ndlovu said the ruling “sets a crucial precedent that the rule of law, not mob justice, protects everyone in South Africa regardless of nationality”.

The group of “suburban moms,” several reportedly from Oak Park, were arrested after they hopped barricades and sat down in a circle together in the middle of the Beach Street driveway leading into the federal facility. The women were arrested by Cook County Sheriff’s deputies less than a minute later, according to the sheriff’s office.

The agency said that 15 women ages 23 to 59 were arrested in total, with all of them now facing charges of disorderly conduct and obstruction.

The protestors had set out “to demand an end to the unjust separation of families, as well as the campaign of chaos and intimidation by federal agents in the Chicago area,” according to a statement from protest organizers provided to Wednesday Journal.

“We have all seen the power of parents connecting together to care for everyone’s children and to keep each other safe. We know that community is the key to holding our government agencies accountable for their actions,” said Nikki Kidd, one of the mothers who participated in the protest. “We cannot continue to let our government traumatize children, neighbors, teachers, laborers, and anyone else in our community who is now on constant high alert. If they will drag a teacher out of a daycare, what is next?”

The group includes some of the latest Oak Park residents to be arrested at protests at the facility, which was the subject of several court orders issued by a federal judge on Wednesday concerning the reported inhumane treatment of detainees.

In 2024, Trump won roughly 48% of the Latino vote nationally– a record for any Republican presidential candidate.
Some Republicans saw this week’s trends among Latino voters as a “wake-up call.” “The Hispanic vote is not guaranteed.
Last year “it wasn’t Latino voters turning out for the Republican Party, it was Latino voters turning out for President Trump,” he said.
“The job of the Democratic Party is now to reach out to Latino voters in ways that are more than just symbolic.”","Washington – President Donald Trump made historic gains with Latinos when he won reelection last year, boosting Republicans’ confidence that their economic message was helping them make inroads with a group of voters who had long leaned toward Democrats.

But in this week’s election, Democrats in key states were able to disrupt that rightward shift by gaining back Latino support, exit polls showed.

In New Jersey and Virginia, the Democrats running for governor made gains in counties with large Latino populations, and overall won two-thirds of the Latino vote in their states, according to an NBC News poll.

And in California, a CNN exit poll showed about 70% of Latinos voting in favor of Proposition 50, a Democratic redistricting initiative designed to counter Trump’s plans to reshape congressional maps in an effort to keep GOP control of the House.

The results mark the first concrete example at the ballot box of Latino voters turning away from the GOP – a shift foreshadowed by recent polling as their concerns about the economy and immigration raids have grown.

If the trend continues, it could spell trouble for Republicans in next year’s midterm elections, said Gary Segura, a professor of public policy, political science and Chicana/o studies at UCLA. This could be especially true in California and Texas, where both parties are banking on Latino voters to help them pick up seats in the House, Segura said.

“A year is a long time in politics, but certainly the vote on Prop. 50 is a very, very good sign for the Democrats’ ability to pick up the newly drawn congressional districts,” Segura said. “I think Latino voters will be really instrumental in the outcome.”

Democrats, meanwhile, are feeling optimistic that their warnings about Trump’s immigration crackdown and a bad economy are resonating with Latinos.

Republicans are wondering to what degree the party can maintain support among Latinos without Trump on the ticket. In 2024, Trump won roughly 48% of the Latino vote nationally– a record for any Republican presidential candidate.

Some Republicans saw this week’s trends among Latino voters as a “wake-up call.”

“The Hispanic vote is not guaranteed. Hispanics married President Donald Trump but are only dating the GOP,” Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida said in a social media video the day after the election. “I’ve been warning it: If the GOP does not deliver, we will lose the Hispanic vote all over the country.”

Economic issues a main driver

Last year Trump was able to leverage widespread frustration with the economy to win the support of Latinos. He promised to create jobs and lower the costs of living.

But polling shows that a majority of Latino voters now disapprove of how Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress are handling the economy. Half of Latinos said they expected Trump’s economic policies to leave them worse off a year from now in a Unidos poll released last week.

In New Jersey, that sentiment was exemplified by voters like Rumaldo Gomez. He told MSNBC he voted for Trump last year but this week went for the Democratic candidate for governor, Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

“Now, I look at Trump different,” Gomez said. “The economy does not look good.”

Gomez added he is “very sad” about immigration raids led by the Trump administration that have split up hardworking families.

While Latino voters fear being affected by immigration enforcement actions, polling suggests they are more concerned about cost of living, jobs and housing. The Unidos poll showed immigration ranking fifth on the list of concerns.

In New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats’ double-digit victories were built on promises to reduce the cost of living, while blaming Trump for their economic pain.

Marcus Robinson, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said Democrats “expanded margins and flipped key counties by earning back Latino voters who know Trump’s economy leaves them behind.”

“These results show that Latino communities want progress, not a return to chaos and broken promises,” he said.

Republicans see a different Trump issue

GOP strategist Matt Terrill, who was chief of staff for then-Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the election results are not a referendum on Trump.

Latino voters swung left because Trump wasn’t on the ballot, he said.

Last year “it wasn’t Latino voters turning out for the Republican Party, it was Latino voters turning out for President Trump,” he said. “Like him or not, he’s able to fire up voters that the Republican Party traditionally does not get.”

With Trump barred by the Constitution from running for a third term, Republicans are left to wonder if they can get the Latino vote back when he is not on the ballot. Terrill believes Republicans need to hammer on the issue of affordability as a top priority.

Mike Madrid, a “never Trump” Republican and former political director of the California Republican Party, has a different theory.

“They’re abandoning both parties,” Madrid said of Latinos. “They abandoned the Republican Party for the same reasons they abandoned the Democratic Party in November: not addressing economic concerns.”

The economy has long been the top concern for Latinos, Madrid said, yet both parties continue to frame the Latino political agenda around immigration.

“Latinos aren’t voting for Democrats or Republicans – they’re voting against Democrats and against Republicans,” Madrid said. “It’s a very big difference. The partisans are all looking at us as if we’re this peculiar exotic little creature.”

The work ahead

Democrat Abigail Spanberger was elected governor in Virginia in part because of big gains in Latino-heavy communities. One of the biggest gains was in Manassas Park, where more than 40% of residents are Latino. She won the city by 42 points, doubling the Democrats’ performance there in last year’s election.

The shift toward Democrats happened because Latinos believed Trump when he promised to bring down high costs of living and that he would only go after violent criminals in immigration raids, said Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, who worked with Spanberger’s campaign on outreach to Spanish-language media.

Instead, she argued, Trump betrayed them.

Cardona said Medicaid cuts under Trump’s massive spending package this year, along with the reduction of supplemental nutrition assistance amid the government shutdown, have Latinos families panicking.

“What Republicans misguidedly and mistakenly thought was a realignment of Latino voters just turned out to be a blip,” she said. “Latinos should never be considered a base vote.”

Political scientists caution that the election outcomes this week are not necessarily indicative of how races will play out a year from now.

“It’s just one election, but certainly the seeds have been planted for strong Latino Democratic turnouts in 2026,” said Brad Jones, a political science professor at UC Davis.

Now, both parties need to explain how they expect to carry out their promises if elected.

“They can’t sit on their laurels and say, ‘well surely the Latinos are coming back because the economy is bad and immigration enforcement is bad,’” Jones said. “The job of the Democratic Party is now to reach out to Latino voters in ways that are more than just symbolic.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/08/PDTN/87170102007-ap-23059076751012.jpg?crop=5611,3157,x0,y104&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-09 11:17:07.707453

Posts about the shooting were shared widely on social media, where some told a slightly different version of events — claiming agents shot Jimenez in the back instead of the shoulder, for instance.

Snopes readers wrote in looking for more information about the situation. We reached out to Jimenez's lawyer and the Department of Homeland Security looking for more details, but had not heard back at time of publication.

According to The New York Times, Jimenez, who is a U.S. citizen, was on his way to his job at a food bank in Ontario, California, when he noticed ICE agents blocking traffic near a bus stop where children would soon be gathering on their way to school. He pulled over his car to ask immigration officers to clear the street and move away from the bus stop, the Times reported.

So far, there has been no video evidence documenting what happened next, and DHS and Jimenez have provided conflicting accounts. (It's worth noting that The New York Times previously investigated a case in which an ICE agent fatally shot a man in Chicago, and found discrepancies in the official DHS account. )

According to a court document filed against Jimenez, who was charged with assaulting a federal officer, one of the officers — gun in hand — approached Jimenez and told him to leave, then took out a canister of pepper spray. Jimenez briefly drove forward and away from the incident before ""rapidly"" reversing back towards a second officer, the criminal complaint says.

The officer with the pepper spray then shot Jimenez in the shoulder through the back window, according to the document. Trisha McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, told ABC News that ""the subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle."" Jimenez later checked himself into a hospital, where, after treatment, he was arrested by federal officers before being released on bond.

Statements Jimenez's lawyer provided the LA Times, The New York Times, ABC News and the news radio station KPCC agreed with some details — the agent approached Jimenez with a gun in hand and took out his pepper spray, while Jimenez quickly reversed his vehicle.

They disagreed with other details, though — according to the lawyers, Jimenez, who was afraid, had to back up in order to leave, he said, because the agent's cars were blocking a lane of traffic. The lawyers claimed that the agent fired at Jimenez while he was driving away.

Conley said the raid stemmed from ""nuisance"" complaints at the Kenner boat launch, adding that his agency worked with Louisiana State Police and federal agencies including the FBI, ICE, DEA and HSI on the joint operation.

Few details of the operation were available Saturday. Authorities have not identified the people who were detained, nor have they said what, if any, criminal charges or immigration laws they are accused of violating.

Mark McCormick, a Kenner Police spokesperson, in a text message said Kenner Police ""did not arrest or charge any individuals.""

""These individuals were placed in the custody of ICE officers and any questions regarding charges or status should be directed to ICE officials,"" he said. A State Police spokesman, Capt. Nick Manale, also referred questions to ICE.

Spokespeople for ICE, HSI and the FBI did not respond to requests for the identities of those detained in the operation and information about what wrongdoing authorities may have accused them of.

The operation marks one of the largest immigration raids of President Donald Trump's second term in the New Orleans area, immigrant rights advocates and attorneys say — second only to a raid at a New Orleans flood mitigation construction site in May in which between 15 and 24 people were detained.

Conley said the operation followed a need to get tougher on ""lawlessness"" and ""nuisance crimes"" he said have been occurring along the Lake Pontchartrain lakefront.

""Citizens were getting harassed, bullied,"" he said in the video.

Law enforcement arrived at the lakefront and ""interviewed a lot of people,"" Conley said, adding that HSI and ICE and took ""13 or 15 people into custody for further investigation.""

Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group whose members investigate and fact-check reports of immigration raids in the New Orleans area, shared video of the operation on its Facebook page, urging residents in Kenner, which has a large Hispanic community, to avoid the area.

The group said the operation was underway at around 10:15 p.m. Friday and that a helicopter was involved.

The video shows ICE agents leading men with hands bound behind their backs to a row of what appear to be Louisiana State Police cruisers.

Amid President Trump's immigration crackdown, Louisiana State Police and Kenner Police have both entered controversial 287(g) agreements, which empower local police officers to enforce federal immigration laws.

The other is a ""task force model"" agreement which gives local officers a wider array of authorities to perform immigration enforcement actions.

The Department of Homeland Security said agents were conducting immigration enforcement operations near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue when an unknown man driving a black Jeep fired shots at agents and drove off.

DHS further alleges a group of people also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicle.

Cell phone video shows agents get out of their vehicle on Kedzie Avenue. Employees of a nearby business told WGN-TV they sheltered indoors after hearing gunfire and a crash.

The Chicago Police Department was called in for help and cleared the scene.

CPD said their officers were sent to the 2500 block of South Kedzie Avenue for reports of shots fired at federal agents. Officers secured the scene and there are no reports of anyone hit by gunfire.

One police officer, however, was accidentally hit by a GMC pickup truck driven by a 20-year-old woman. The officer suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital in good condition, while the woman was issued two citations, according to CPD.

The suspect who reportedly fired shots at the agents and the Jeep he was driving have not been found.

Those who live in the area, however, are accusing federal agents of being aggressive.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward) said he asked agents for warrants and identification after hearing they tried to detain a man in a vehicle with a child inside.

“When we arrived here, there was an 11-year-old little girl dragged by these masked individuals and the neighbors are trying to surround to make sure that they didn’t take her,” he said.

Sigcho-Lopez added that witnesses told him agents broke the window of a car.

“Look at what they’ve done to our community. Since 10 a.m. then and this is sadness. This is outrageous,” he said.

WGN-TV has reached out to DHS on the incident involving an 11-year-old girl and is awaiting a response.

Once federal agents cleared the area, protesters turned their attention to remaining CPD officer conducting crowd control, yelling “shame” in their direction.

“This incident is not isolated and reflects a growing and dangerous trend of violence and obstruction. Over the past two months, we’ve seen an increase in assaults and obstruction targeting federal law enforcement during operations. These confrontations highlight the dangers our agents face daily and the escalating aggression toward law enforcement. The violence must end,” DHS said.

It’s been two months since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz. Those who live in the area said they’ve had enough.

“I’m asking them to de-escalate. Ilive here. My daughter goes to school here. We went shopping. We’re trying to go shopping. I went to Walgreens. Ridiculous, it’s enough already. This needs to stop,” one protester said.

It’s unclear how many people were detained Saturday.

She also pointed to U.S. policies that require Mexico to accept deported migrants, adding strain on the country's system and complicating efforts to distinguish who is seeking asylum locally.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported 78,906 asylum applications in Mexico last year. Of 31,922 initial decisions, 78 percent were approved.

Lepri said at the time that the caseload remains high despite declining financial support, leaving the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) under-resourced. He also noted that COMAR handled just a few thousand cases annually in 2016–2017 but now processes close to 100,000 per year and that the agency needs to ""strengthen"" capacity, especially as UNHCR has begun reducing personnel and external support by about 20%.",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/584950/border-before-migrants-arrive-el-ceibo-guatemala.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 07:18:06.726912

Authorities said the incident began near South Sawyer Avenue & West 26th Street. Border Patrol agents were conducting enforcement operations when DHS said a man driving in a black Jeep fired shots at them and took off.

DHS in a statement said ""an unknown number of agitators also threw a paint can and bricks at border patrol’s vehicles. Chicago Police Department was called for assistance and cleared the scene. The shooter and vehicle remain at large, and this is a dynamic situation.""

The incident later spilled over to West 23rd Street and Sawyer Avenue. Chicago police officers could be seen trying to disperse the crowd. Neighbors said they heard the commotion and went outside to check and saw federal agents walking a young girl in the alley.

One woman who didn't want to show her face on camera said agents were trying to get ahold of the girl's family.

""I just stood in front of the little girl,"" one neighbor said. ""I wrapped my hands around her, I grabbed onto the fence, and I just stayed there and kept telling the agents they couldn’t grab her, she’s a minor. She doesn’t have an adult with her. I don’t know her, I'm just her neighbor.""

The girl's family told Telemundo Chicago that federal agents were looking for her father. The girl's grandmother and another neighbor said, at one point, they tried to search their building.

""They tried to come into my house...trying to say I was hiding someone, which there was no one in my house but my kids, and they insisted,"" the neighbor said. ""They got scared once I told them, 'Show me your warrant, show me your face. Why masks?'""

The U.S. Supreme Court will return Monday for a short week of arguments, in which the justices will consider whether state and local government officials can be held personally liable for alleged religious rights violations and whether government contractors are entitled to immediately appeal denials of derivative sovereign immunity.

The justices will also hear two cases involving the First Step Act's compassionate release provision, 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c), and what factors district courts can consider when entertaining motions for sentence reductions.

The court will also release orders on Monday, and close Tuesday for Veterans Day.

Forced Haircut Liability

On Monday, the Supreme Court will debate whether state and local government officials can be held personally liable for alleged religious rights violations.

Louisiana man Damon Landor has asked the justices to overturn a Fifth Circuit decision affirming the dismissal of his Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, lawsuit against guards at the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Cottonport, Louisiana, who allegedly violated his religious rights by forcibly shaving his head in 2020. Landor, a devout Rastafarian who follows the Nazarite Vow against cutting one's hair, claims the guards handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off his dreadlocks despite his invocation of a previous Fifth Circuit decision that found the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety's prohibition on inmates having dreadlocks was unlawfully burdensome under the act.

An unanimous three-judge panel ""emphatically"" condemned Landor's treatment, but found that circuit precedent from 2009 required dismissal of his claims seeking monetary damages against the guards in their individual capacities. U.S. Congress enacted RLUIPA under its spending clause power, the panel held, which means only the recipient of federal funding – Louisiana in this case – can be held liable for violating the act.

Landor, however, contends RLUIPA unambiguously authorizes lawsuits like his. The act allows a person to ""assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government,"" which is defined to include ""any other person acting under color of state law."" Landor claims the Supreme Court's 2020 decision in Tanzin v. Tanvir, which held that nearly identical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows suits against federal officials in their individual capacities, settles this case. The two acts have long been described as twin statutes and should be read the same way, he said. If RLUIPA prohibits plaintiffs from seeking monetary damages from state officials, then the statute loses a significant deterrent factor, Landor adds. Courts have consistently held that prisoners' claims for prospective relief under the act become moot once they're transferred or released from a facility, so the only viable remedy for past wrongs is monetary damages against officials in their individual capacities, he said.

The federal government agrees, noting that Landor's suggested interpretation follows Congress' policy determination that private lawsuits are important mechanisms for enforcing RLUIPA. Federal lawmakers have broad discretion when it comes to setting conditions for federal funding, the government said, and they often require state and local officials to honor certain rights and statutes as a way to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately. Additionally, nothing in the U.S. Constitution bars Congress from imposing liability on parties other than the named funding recipient, the government claims.

Louisiana counters that legislation like RLUIPA that's enacted under the Constitution's spending clause operates more like a contract, and, therefore, only the named parties can be held liable for any alleged violations. Nonparties like individual officials cannot be bound by terms of a contract they didn't agree to, the state said. The statute also doesn't clearly and unambiguously allow for suits against officials in their individual capacities or for monetary damages. While courts have held that RFRA's language allows plaintiffs to sue federal officials in their individual capacity, the fact that RLUIPA is aimed at states requires a different analysis of the language due to sovereign immunity concerns, Louisiana said.

Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP partner Zachary D. Tripp will argue for Landor, Libby A. Baird, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government in favor of Landor, and Louisiana Solicitor General J. Benjamin Aguiñaga will argue for the state.

The case is Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety et al., case number 23-1197.

Derivate Immunity Appeals

Also on Monday, the justices will consider whether court orders denying government contractors derivative sovereign immunity should be immediately appealable.

The GEO Group Inc., which operates a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora, Colorado, has petitioned the high court to review the Tenth Circuit's dismissal of an interlocutory appeal of a district court's finding that the contractor must face claims of unjust enrichment and allegations that it violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Alejandro Menocal claims in a class action that GEO forced detainees to conduct housekeeping work with threats of solitary confinement for noncompliance and underpaid participants in a voluntary work program.

A three-judge panel dismissed GEO's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the district court's derivative sovereign immunity ruling wasn't a collateral order eligible for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. Section 1291. The questions of whether GEO is entitled to derivative sovereign immunity and whether the contractor is liable for the alleged allegations are based on similar fact patterns, namely whether the challenged actions were ordered by the government or not, the panel said.

GEO argues the Tenth Circuit is wrong and that decisions on derivative sovereign immunity are ""final decisions"" under Section 1291 and subject to an interlocutory appeal exception. District court orders denying similar Immunities, such as absolute immunity, qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity, are immediately appealable because they effect whether a dispute can continue to the merits. Derivative sovereign immunity is similarly dispositive, GEO said, and can't be effectively reviewed on appeal after final judgment. Even if there is some overlap between the facts that help determine immunity and liability questions, the Supreme Court has in the past said the questions are distinct enough to trigger Section 1291's exception, the contractor said.

Menocal, on the other hand, claims GEO's interpretation would lead to piecemeal and costly litigation. Derivative sovereign immunity, despite its name, is not an immunity from liability but a defense to liability, he said, so the question of whether it applies in a particular dispute are usually fact-based ones decided by juries. In virtually every case, derivative sovereign immunity will be intertwined with the dispute's merits, making appeals of final judgments the best avenue to challenge adverse rulings, Menocal said.

The federal government mostly agrees with Menocal, but warns the Supreme Court against issuing a categorical rule. In most situations, it said, decisions on whether contractors are entitled to derivative sovereign immunity will be fact-based defenses that can be vindicated on appeal with a reversal of a final judgment. But there are certain, rare situations in which such decisions may require interlocutory appeals. The Supreme Court could rule against GEO in this case while still leaving some room for interlocutory appeals in those certain situations, the government said.

Greenberg Traurig LLP shareholder Dominic E. Draye will argue for GEO Group, Gupta Wessler LLP principal Jennifer D. Bennett will argue for Menocal, and Sopan Joshi, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government in favor of Menocal.

The case is The GEO Group Inc. v. Menocal et al., case number 24-758.

Sentence Reduction Challenges

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will debate defendants can meet the First Step Act's compassionate release provision's ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" requirement for sentence reduction by alleging grounds typically used for habeas corpus relief.

New York defendant Joe Fernandez, who is currently serving a life sentence in relation to the 2000 murders of two drug cartel members, has asked the justices to review a Second Circuit decision reversing a reduction in his sentence under the compassionate release provision. A Southern District of New York judge reduced Fernandez's sentence to 11 years of time served in 2021 after finding major issues with the sufficiency and reliability of evidence presented against the defendant at trial, including eyewitness testimony, and due to the disparities between the length of Fernandez's sentence and those of his co-defendants.

A three-judge panel reinstated Fernandez's life sentence after finding that none of those reasons rose to the level of ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" required under Section 1291. Fernandez had also previously raised similar challenges under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255, which allows for federal inmates to vacate constitutionally or statutorily defective sentences.

Fernandez claims the Second Circuit impermissibly limited the range of considerations that district courts can take review when deciding whether to reduce a sentence under the First Step Act. The statute's plain language, he said, imposes no ""categorical"" restrictions on what factors courts can review, respecting the historic tradition of granting courts wide discretion in sentencing. Fernandez said he can properly argue that the same reasons that in certain cases may warrant invalidation of a sentence under the habeas corpus statute, warrant a reduction of his sentence in this case. As long as defendants don't use the compassionate relief provision to argue for invalidation of his conviction or sentence, they are free to argue that similar grounds warrant a reduced sentence.

The federal government counters that Fernandez's interpretation of the First Step Act's compassionate release provision would allow defendants to end run the habeas corpus statute. The plain meaning of the compassionate release provision requires a defendant's reasons to be highly unique and often unforeseen. Since Congress predicted that defendants would lodge challenges to their convictions and sentences based on allegedly constitutional violations, abuse of discretion or ineffective assistance of counsel, those reasons don't amount to the ""extraordinary and compelling"" ones contemplated by the compassionate release provision, the government said.

Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP partner Benjamin Gruenstein will argue for Fernandez, and Eric J. Feigin, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government.

The case is Fernandez v. United States, case number 24-556.

Sentence Reduction Reasons

Also on Wednesday, the justices will consider if district court's can consider disparities created by prospective changes in sentencing laws as ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" that warrant a sentence reduction under the First Step Act.

Defendants Daniel Rutherford and Johnnie M. Carter have petitioned the high court in consolidated cases to review the Third Circuit's determination that a 2023 rule issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which states that defendants serving ""unusually long"" sentences who would be subject to much shorter sentences under current law, creates an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason to reduce an individual's sentence under the First Step Act's compassionate relief provision. Rutherford and Carter are currently serving more than 42 years and 70 years in prison, respectively, under now-defunct mandatory minimum statutes for armed bank robberies.

Both men challenged their sentences as unusually long and grossly disparate under the Sentencing Commission's sentence, but the Third Circuit ruled that the guidelines didn't change the fact that the First Step Act's compassionate release provision specifically forbids courts from deeming prospective changes in law as an ""extraordinary or compelling"" reason prompting a sentence reduction.

Rutherford argues the Third Circuit's decision contradicts a long history of giving district courts wide discretion to consider all relevant information when sentencing a defendant. What constitutes an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason for sentence reduction is a case-specific inquiry that, under the plain text of the compassionate release provision, must consider a sentence's length and what would be available under present law. Congress enacted the compassionate release provision with the exact aim of alleviating unusually long sentences, he said, and the Supreme Court should not allow courts to undermine the statute's purpose.

Carter adds that Congress purposefully delegated power to the Sentencing Commission to define what types of ""extraordinary and compelling"" reasons would require sentence reductions. The commission's 2023 decision to allow district courts to consider prospective changes in law was well within its discretion and should receive some deference from the Supreme Court, he said.

Meanwhile, the federal government, claims guidance from the Sentencing Commission can not change the fact that Congress made sentencing reforms explicitly prospective. Lawmakers had the option to apply reforms retroactively to defendants like Rutherford and Carter, but it decided against that. The courts and the commission should respect that policy choice, the government said. Additionally, the commission's limited role is to describe what subsets of potential reasons might warrant a sentence reduction and the 2023 guidelines clearly exceed the boundaries of its delegate power.

Defendants Daniel Rutherford and Johnnie M. Carter have petitioned the high court in consolidated cases to review the Third Circuit's determination that a U.S. Sentencing Commission rule issued in 2023 state that defendants serving ""unusually long"" sentences

David C. Frederick, a Kellogg Hansen Todd Figel & Frederick PLLC partner, will argue for Rutherford, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP partner David A. O'Neil will argue for Carter, and Eric J. Feigin, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government.

The consolidated cases are Rutherford v. United States, case number 24-820, and Carter v. United States, case number 24-860.

Zapata allegedly suffered a medical emergency during the encounter, something the Department of Homeland Security disputes.

Ojeda-Montoya was wanted on an arrest warrant for allegedly stabbing a coworker with a pair of scissors in the hand and throwing a trash can at them.

She was transported to Cumberland County Jail in Scarborough, Maine, where she will remain in custody pending removal proceedings.

Her detainment sparked outrage in the community, with Fitchburg's mayor, Sam Squailia, releasing a lengthy statement criticizing ICE for putting both Fitchburg officers and witnesses in a tough spot.

""These unannounced federal actions place our local officers in an impossible situation,"" she said.

Squailia also encouraged community members to keep documenting ICE encounters in the city to hold the agency accountable.

""Keep showing up for one another, keep documenting, keep speaking,"" she said.

Assistant Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin was critical of the media and the crowd, saying they endangered the ICE agents who were just doing their jobs.

He knew those vehicles carried federal agents and he saw them as they came closer.
They’re resisting the presence of federal agents who look more like soldiers, and immigration raids that feel like attacks.
Not long after the formal announcement of Operation Midway Blitz, there was the viral video of a man on a bike eluding federal agents downtown.
The doors to some of Chicago’s most authentic Mexican restaurants have remained locked for fear of federal agents.","Baltazar Enriquez began wearing his whistle in June, when the threat of the Trump administration’s immigration raids was more focused and the fear perhaps less widespread in Chicago. The whistle — green plastic, attached to an orange lanyard — was at first a small gesture of preparedness. It has since become a symbol of resistance.

In the beginning, the sight of it around Enriquez’s neck prompted questions and confusion in Little Village, one of Chicago’s proudest Latino neighborhoods. He remembers people asking him, perplexed: “What is a whistle gonna do?”

“And we said, ‘Well, the whistle is in case immigration is around, and you start blowing. The whistle is for people who are undocumented to go away, to lock their doors, lock their gates and not open the door.’

“And it grew like wildfire. Now everybody’s using it.”

For the past two months of President Donald Trump’s so-called Operation Midway Blitz, federal agents have engaged in a norm-defying assault on the Chicago area. In Little Village, where Enriquez is president of the community council, restaurant doors have remained locked and business along 26th Street has slowed.

The resistance born there, though, has spread. A movement that began in Chicago’s Latino enclaves has arrived in neighborhoods everywhere, breaking through segregation and boundaries long defined by race and socioeconomic status. A city known for its resilience and a take-no-nonsense attitude has found another reason to unite

And in its unity, the city has made a statement, an unmistakable message akin to the one a woman packing whistles at a recent “Whistlemania” event on the Northwest Side hoped to send.

“Show ’em that you don’t (expletive) with Chicago,” she said.

The whistles have become part of the city’s soundtrack, the sight of them around people’s necks as common as Bears jerseys. But the resistance to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, often dressed in tactical gear, toting weapons built for war through city neighborhoods and suburban subdivisions, has taken many forms. A movement has grown through acts large and small.

Resistance is a woman documenting the deployment of tear gas in Broadview. It’s neighbors coming together to grab one of their own from the grasp of federal agents in Old Irving Park. It’s a white suburban mom rushing from her house in Mount Prospect, phone camera in hand, to scream at federal agents to get out of her village.

It’s a 24-year-old man, the son of Mexican migrants, who alerted dozens of day laborers of the presence of ICE during a recent raid in the northwest suburbs, and then sheltered and protected them. It’s a young Black man on the South Side recording the detainment of several U.S. citizens following an apparently warrantless raid and sharing that video with the world.

And it’s hundreds of high school students who walked out of their classes and into the streets of Little Village, carrying flags and signs and blowing whistles, literally and figuratively.

In Little Village alone, Enriquez said, he and his colleagues on the community council have distributed almost 10,000 whistles. In the earliest days of the Chicago resistance, he said ICE and Border Patrol officers responded with bewilderment when people began blowing them in their presence. Enriquez can remember one agent who smirked and laughed at the sound.

“But he didn’t, once he saw people locking their doors and getting away,” he said.

The movement, like the noise, has only grown more intense.

‘No longtime activist’

She resisted because others inspired her to resist. Because for weeks she’d watched videos of protests at an ICE detention facility in Broadview and of standoffs between Chicagoans and federal agents in Brighton Park and the East Side and everywhere else. Videos that, at times, showed the targets of the raids “literally fighting for their lives.”

She resisted, ultimately, because agents showed up on her street on a random Sunday afternoon in October. Outside her door. On her quiet block in Mount Prospect. That’s when Lisa Porter ran outside.

“It was sort of like I was finally able to find a place to put my rage,” she said later, “and try to be a little productive instead of feeling so helpless.”

Porter, 53, had never been all that politically active. She’d never been much of a protester. She’s a suburban mother of three — a 13-year-old daughter and twins who are 11. “I’m no longtime activist,” she said.

Her resistance began that day “by running out and screaming at people.”

“Now, granted,” she said, “I recognize that that’s not necessarily a tactic that everyone thinks is terribly effective. (But) I had been seeing a lot of it on those videos, and really it seemed to be the thing that got them to back down.”

There were agents in two SUVs down her street that day, and others circling nearby blocks in four or five more vehicles. She remembers their masks. About 20 of her neighbors had gathered outside to bear witness, with some of them, like Porter, rushing to protect anyone who might be targeted. Rumors swirled up and down the street and in the aftermath: that it was a cartel member they were after.

Or a sex offender. Or a murderer. Or someone who was all three?

The “worst of the worst,” as the Trump administration has often put it.

“There were several different stories that they told,” Porter said, but she knows that at “no point did they say, ‘Stay in your houses. There’s a dangerous criminal on the loose.’”

She cannot be sure whether the agents ultimately apprehended anyone. If they did, she didn’t see it, which leads her to believe it didn’t happen. She was, after all, trailing the vehicles — confronting the agents inside, screaming at them. A Tribune photographer captured Porter in mid-scream, her face twisted in rage, the masked agents on the other end of her ire avoiding eye contact.

The one in the driver’s seat is looking away from her. The other straight ahead.

She was yelling “a lot of not-safe-for-work things,” she said.

She remembers one interaction, when an agent that day asked her if she was “OK with criminals in the neighborhood.”

“You’re the criminals,” she told them. “You’re the ones kidnapping people off the street.”

About two weeks later, Porter received a text from a neighbor. ICE was back. Porter made her way to her neighbor’s house but by the time she arrived the agents were gone. It left locals feeling uneasy and angry again. On the way home, Porter noticed a young man mowing a nearby lawn. She flagged him down and offered a warning:

“I just want you to be safe,” she told him. “ICE is in the area.”

But he already knew. What he said in response has lingered in Porter’s mind.

She can still hear him saying it:

“They came and took my dad 10 minutes ago.”

‘These are my people’

He resisted because he identifies with those who’ve been targeted and deported. Because he has never forgotten the sacrifices his parents made or their journey from Michoacán, Mexico, to West Englewood, where he “didn’t grow up in one of the best neighborhoods,” but where he found opportunity, nonetheless.

He resisted, ultimately, because “these are my people.” That was one of Efrain Cuevas’ first thoughts when he noticed the caravan of Ford Explorers with Texas plates last month. And there was a moment, however brief, when his mind offered an alternative to what he was seeing.

“I guess people from Texas are visiting,” he said to himself. But at the same time he knew. He knew those vehicles carried federal agents and he saw them as they came closer. That was when Cuevas began shouting. Began screaming, with as much force as he could muster:

“La Migra! La Migra!”

“Which is ICE, in Spanish,” he said. “Everybody just started running.”

“It was everybody for themselves.”

Cuevas, 24, is an American citizen and Chicago native. He attended Chicago Bulls College Prep on the Near West Side. He said he served in the Marines. Now he works in maintenance at an apartment complex in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates. The apartments needed new windows and so the management company hired a crew.

Dozens of laborers arrived. Cuevas estimates that about 40 of them were in the U.S without legal permission.

In a way, they reminded him of his parents. They’d come to this area seeking opportunity. The only difference, as Cuevas saw it, was that he happened to be born here and they didn’t. But he wondered: “Why can’t we all just be human?”

“We all bleed red,” he said. “But, you know, I guess people just don’t like specific skin colors.”

When he started shouting upon the arrival of the agents, the workers began to scramble. It was “chaos,” Cuevas said, “and I’ll always see people just running in different directions.” They’d been there to install windows but now there was panic. Some of the crew members found their way into the buildings they were working on. Cuevas opened doors to unoccupied units where workers hid.

He tried to interrupt detainments in progress and asked for search warrants. One of the agents, he said, asked him if he was a U.S. citizen.

“Yes, sir,” Cuevas responded, and again asked to see a search warrant.

“But these agents are like — the Constitution? They don’t even care about it,” he said.

It was only after everything quieted down that Cuevas realized that agents detained at least three workers. Dozens of others remained hidden until the agents left. Some of the workers had their car keys taken, Cuevas said. The agents swiped them out of the ignition through open windows so that the owners of those cars wouldn’t be able to drive away.

Cuevas tried to facilitate safe exits when the time came and, for days after, everything played over in his mind: the sight of the SUVs, the workers running, the agents giving chase.

“I’m still in shock,” he said.

A week later, the new windows and the equipment to install them were still scattered about the property, a job left unfinished. Cars remained parked on the grass, left behind by people taken away, or ones who escaped and were too afraid to come back. The scene offers constant reminders. Cuevas has thought a lot about his parents, who “wanted to give their kids an American dream.”

He suspects it wasn’t much different for the workers.

“I saw this and it really did hit home for me,” he said. “And I was like, I have to protect these people …

“Who’s gonna look after them?”

‘Chicago isn’t playing around’

Resistance is as much a part of Chicago’s history as resilience, and in a lot of ways one can’t exist without the other. This is a city that rose from the ashes of a fire and rebuilt itself 150 years ago. The Haymarket Riot of the 1880s, when the working class fought for an eight-hour work day, remains one of the most important labor movements in American history.

In 1968, the turmoil surrounding the Democratic National Convention — where Mayor Richard J. Daley’s police force met anti-Vietnam war activists with brute and bloody force — underscored a greater American unrest. One speaker, Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, lambasted Daley for his “gestapo tactics” against protesters.

Almost 60 years later, little has changed about the city’s spirit. The difference, though, is that those resisting now aren’t doing so in opposition to war in a faraway place. They’re resisting, instead, what they consider to be an invasion of their city and their neighborhoods. They’re resisting the presence of federal agents who look more like soldiers, and immigration raids that feel like attacks.

The deeds of resistance, themselves, can be wide-ranging. They don’t fit neatly into boxes. They can be, as one viral social media post detailed, as simple as a middle schooler handing out whistle packets with a know-your-rights card on a city street. They can be the profane messages, written on the street in chalk, against ICE outside of its facility in Broadview, or the 14 suburban women who were arrested Friday after they hopped the concrete barricades that have proliferated around the processing center, sat down in the middle of the street and held hands in a organized display of civil disobedience.

They can be marches. Or walkouts. Or a local ironworker and union board member who spread the word in a video on Tik-Tok — seen more than 32,000 times as of Friday evening — that “Chicago isn’t playing around.”

“We’ve been standing up to government since the 1800s,” Paul Goodrich of Iron Workers Local #63, says into the camera. He wears his hard hat and a short beard. And, as a white man who works “a hard job,” as he put it, he has the look of the kind of person President Donald Trump most tries to appeal to. But Goodrich isn’t having it.

“If Donald Trump thinks that he could come in here and send his police force to hold us down, he’s wrong,” he said. “The whistles are everywhere … this is what we do. The best thing we do in Chicago is organize. So good luck.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In previous statements, its spokespeople have labeled residents opposed to their enforcement as “rioters, gangbangers and terrorists.”

In Chicago, some moments of recent resistance have received national attention. Not long after the formal announcement of Operation Midway Blitz, there was the viral video of a man on a bike eluding federal agents downtown. Scenes of the protests in Broadview have been broadcast to the rest of the country.

But resistance often comes in quieter forms, in the shadows.

In the days after the late September nighttime raid of an apartment building in South Shore, in a predominantly Black neighborhood, residents spoke out against the militarized invasion of their community — one in which some federal agents rappelled from helicopters.

Someone placed a small memorial on a fence near the place where 37 people had been taken into custody. There was a hula-hoop. A pink stuffed animal. A hopeful message:

“This too will pass … Protect South Shore. Protect Chicago.”

Resistance can be a lot of things but they always come in the form of “an oppositional action,” said Rachel Einwohner, a Purdue University political sociologist who has studied resistance movements for nearly 30 years.

“It could be posting on social media,” she said. “It could be participating in a march. It could be giving shelter to somebody who, you know — you hear the whistle and you’re like, ‘Oh, my God, ICE is coming,’ and you see somebody running, and you let them into your house.”

Chicago’s history of taking stands “is absolutely important” in shaping this current moment of resistance, Einwohner said, but resistance movements are not limited by ideology or political leaning. She noted that one “could say MAGA was a whole resistance movement” of its own, one that spawned Midway Blitz, but now Chicagoans find themselves pushing back.

“In this particular moment, the city of Chicago is absolutely being targeted because of its history, because of its politics, because of the Trump administration and how they’re kind of seeing things,” Einwohner said.

To stand in opposition requires very little. The challenge for scholars in her line of work, Einwohner said, is quantifying the difference any of it makes.

How does one measure the effectiveness of a social media post? Or the blowing of a whistle?

Or a march or a walkout? It can be difficult to answer.

“But small acts have huge consequences,” Einwohner said, and she thought of the person who thought to take video of George Floyd’s murder. “If she hadn’t done that, then things would be a lot different. So (resistance can be) just kind of saying, ‘I’m going to be a witness to this,’ and I’m going to say, ‘No, this is not right.’”

Whistlemania

They resisted because they believe this is not right. Because they felt like they had to do something, even if it was small.

Wednesday evenings are usually quiet at Illuminated Brew Works in Norwood Park, but the place was almost full a little after 6 p.m. on a recent Wednesday. By 6:30, it was at capacity — not a spot at the bar or any of the tables organizers brought in just for the night.

The brewery is tucked into a small industrial space off of Northwest Highway, not far from O’Hare International Airport, in Chicago’s far northwest corner. It’s a part of the city’s 41st Ward — one of the few in Chicago where Trump found success in the 2024 election. Norwood Park is not necessarily a bastion of progressivism. It is instead something of a reddish or purple island in a deep blue city.

And yet even here, where Trump won several nearby precincts, organizers of a Whistlemania event, one of several throughout Chicago in recent weeks, did not bring enough whistles. Or know-your-rights cards. Or any of the other supplies that would’ve met demand.

Agnes Guerra, one of those organizers, was not sure what to expect. She feared low turnout, and worried that a whistle-packing event in one of Chicago’s most conservative-leaning neighborhoods might come and go unnoticed.

“This ward is very red,” she said, but over the past two months she found herself “doing something every day to keep myself sane.” Sometimes that meant protesting in Broadview. Sometimes it meant spending money to support businesses that had been affected by the raids. She said she was among the early wave of protesters in Broadview when agents reacted with force.

“My joke is how do you radicalize middle-aged white women?” she asked.

“You throw tear gas at them.”

She met another neighborhood organizer, Virginia Jimenez, online, and the planning began for Whistlemania at the brewery. They thought they needed enough whistles and information packets for 1,000 people. That seemed like a lofty goal. But they could’ve used twice as many. The sight of so many people coming into the brewery to fold informational flyers into small booklets, and pack them into little bags with plastic whistles, made Guerra and Jimenez emotional.

It was especially personal for Jimenez, who recounted her personal history of arriving in the United States from Guatemala when she was 5-years-old.

“I’m very passionate about our rights, just as humans,” she said. In recent weeks she has spent a lot of time driving children of migrants around the city, to and from school or to appointments or to the grocery store, because their parents are too afraid to leave home. Too afraid of walking through their door and never returning again.

Jimenez and Guerra hoped the whistle packs they collected that night might make a small difference.

They could offer a warning. Maybe help slow a pursuit. Perhaps tell someone to run.

About 20 minutes after Whistlemania began, Guerra grabbed a microphone and said they were running low on supplies. Not long after that, she announced that they’d run out. The 1,000 whistles they had packed were destined for churches and little free libraries on street corners.

And, eventually, around people’s necks, waiting to be heard.

‘We had to fight’

They sounded the alarm in the distance down 26th Street in Little Village on a recent Tuesday morning, the shrill growing louder along with that of the chants that accompanied it. By then, students at Social Justice High had walked out of class. They’d grabbed their signs and flags and marched toward the arch at the neighborhood’s eastern edge.

The arch is the community’s most prominent landmark, and the words that stretch across it, in large letters, offer a warm greeting: “Bienvenidos a Little Village.” Lately, though, the place hasn’t felt all that inviting. The doors to some of Chicago’s most authentic Mexican restaurants have remained locked for fear of federal agents.

Along the usually busy 26th, which is Little Village’s version of Main Street, foot traffic has slowed outside of the quinceañera boutiques and other local establishments. Parking is easy to come by. Small signs taped to windows are common, ones that read: “ICE/CBP agents DO NOT have consent to enter this business/restaurant unless they have a valid judicial warrant.”

Anxiety has run high here ever since Trump’s second inauguration 10 months ago. Yet it has been especially tense since the start of the blitz and even more so since federal agents, accompanied by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, showed up in Little Village on Oct. 23. A confrontation ensued and the agents dispersed tear gas.

The community felt attacked. Wounded. The students marched because they wanted to heal.

One of them, Lia Sophia Lopez, helped lead the march down 26th. She carried a bullhorn and led chants, her voice cracking at times with emotion. She addressed the crowd upon its arrival under the arch, and preached a message of unity and resilience and resistance.

“When they attacked our community, it hurt,” she said. “We had to fight. We had to protect our people. Because people are scared to leave their homes.

“People are scared to even walk across the street. … We’re doing this to protect the people’s peace so people are not scared of leaving and people are not scared to fight back.”

She began to head back toward school, with more than a hundred others who’d walked out, and the route took the students past the locked restaurants and quiet storefronts, through a wary neighborhood that refuses to give in. Days later, Baltazar Enriquez, president of the community council, stepped out of his office and into Don Pepe, the restaurant right next door.

He took a look around at the empty tables and said, “This restaurant used to be full at this time.” For months, Enriquez has tried to comfort and lead neighbors while his community — home to the city’s largest Mexican American population — became a focal point of the raids. Now it was the afternoon of Halloween and an eerie quiet hung over 26th Street. Enriquez grappled with a new question that had been facing his community:

Should it cancel its annual Halloween parade? Or should it encourage a community gathering in a time of constant unease, one in which “we’ve got ICE everywhere,” Enriquez said. He thought of children yearning to wear their costumes and march carefree down the street. He thought of parents who’d been too afraid to leave home but who needed a small taste of normalcy. Of belonging.

He came to think it wasn’t much of a decision at all.

And so the parade would go on. It had to go on.

Enriquez solicited dozens of volunteers. They planned to protect children in the case of a raid. To make a human circle, if the need arose, to block federal agents.

In the end, none of it was needed. But the resistance had been ready. To protect each other. To make noise.

They didn’t have tear gas or guns. But they had each other. And the little pieces of plastic Enriquez and thousands of other Chicagoans keep around their necks.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-Little-Village-ICE04.jpg?w=1024&h=697,N,,2025-11-08 22:16:45.595294

The Portland Immigration Rights Coalition said there were five confirmed detentions in the Seaside area on Saturday.

“Through hotline calls and through our community partners as part of the Oregon for All coalition, PIRC has received information for five community members who were detained in the Seaside area on Nov. 8,” said PIRC spokesperson Natalie Lerner. “We have heard there may be additional detentions and want the community to know we are here for them as a connection to resources. As with all of the currently-escalating immigration enforcement in our state, we condemn today’s detentions — those abducted are believed family, friends, and community members. Immigration agents only serve to sow panic and trauma in our state, and we are proud to be part of the strong community response to support our neighbors. Our hotline is here 24/7 for anyone across the state who has had their family or friends taken or who believes they have witnessed ICE activity.”

According to a KMUN news report about the activity, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began running license plates and pulling people over and taking them into custody around 8 a.m.

Prior to Saturday, the last time a local ICE presence was reported was through Facebook in Depoe Bay in May and one arrest was reported in Newport in September.

The Seaside detentions come as the Trump administration ramps up ICE activity nationwide.

The Facebook posts, many anonymous, began popping up mid-morning: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was observed and reported apprehending people in Seaside.

Photos and videos were posted of ICE vehicles outside of Beach Books in Seaside and reports said “two to seven” people were taken into custody.

Beach Books store employee Hilary Weigel said she had seen the posts on Facebook but did not see anything at the store.

“I believe it happened before the store opened (at 10 a.m.),” Weigel said.

Jenny Pool Radway told KMUN reporter Katie Frankowicz that all five of the people detained in Seaside were on their way to jobs in the area. Pool Radway is the executive director of the Astoria-based nonprofit Consejo Hispano that provides servised to the Latine communities on Oregon’s North Coast. She likened Saturday’s operation to “a fishing expedition.”

“You’re not picking up someone who is a danger to the community,” Pool Radway said. “These are our friends, our neighbors, just regular tax-paying community members who are being hunted down.”

Seaside police dispatch, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Office and Sgt. Litwin at the Astoria Police Department all reported that their offices were not involved in any ICE activity and they had not been contacted by the agency.

The Facebook posts ramped up throughout the morning and into the afternoon, reporting sightings of ICE vehicles moving up from Cannon Beach to Astoria, however, the only known apprehensions occurred in Seaside.

There was affordability, the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his first news conference since winning the election the night before. Then there was what he called “an authoritarian administration” under President Donald Trump.

""It'll be my job to deliver on both,"" Mamdani said. ""It will be my job to stand up for the city.""

Trump, a Queens native, has loomed over the election in his hometown, and he has threatened to punish New York with measures such as cutting the city's funds if voters elected Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens. If Mamdani became mayor, Trump recently said it would be hard for him to give ""a lot of money"" to New York, adding Mamdani would waste the money with his left-leaning politics.

Mamdani has vowed to fight back in court when he takes office in January.

Here’s a rundown of what Trump could do to the nation’s largest city, and what Mamdani can do in response to − as his campaign platform promised − “Trump-proof” New York.

Deploy National Guard

In contrast to some of the other largest cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, New York has been untouched by the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard. Trump could try deploying troops to city streets.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has had National Guard at subway stations to reduce transit crime, but has reportedly been preparing to push back on Trump deploying troops into the city.

Lame-duck Mayor Eric Adams forged a bond with Trump after the Justice Department dropped federal corruption charges against Adams so he could help with Trump’s immigration crackdown.

In contrast, Mamdani has discussed forming a coalition with state officials, including Trump’s nemesis, New York Attorney General Letitia James, to sue the federal government if troops get sent. He’s cited the success by LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom in lawsuits that blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in California.

Large-scale immigration raids

Other Democratic cities such as Chicago, LA and Boston have seen sweeping immigration raids on streets, construction sites and businesses.

New York had highly publicized immigration enforcement operations shortly after Trump's return to office, but has not had the same scale of enforcement. There was a recent chaotic immigration raid by federal agents on street vendors allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise in lower Manhattan.

Federal agents have targeted people attending immigration court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins at a Manhattan federal building. The federal actions have sometimes resulted in violence against migrants, including one woman thrown to the ground by an agent.

Mamdani said he’d hold federal agents carrying out Trump’s immigration enforcement to the same legal standard as anyone else, implying that ICE agents could be arrested for assaulting New Yorkers.

“If you violate the law, you must be held accountable,” he said. “And there is sadly a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.”

Mamdani has vowed to make New York the nation’s strongest sanctuary city, which broadly means limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Mamdani has also called to invest $165 million to fund immigration legal defense services. He’s said his administration would survey every city system to protect sensitive data of undocumented people and others.

Behind the scenes, state officials and business leaders are reportedly trying to prevent raids. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in October successfully persuaded the Trump administration not to conduct enforcement in the California city.

Cut federal funds to NYC

Early in Trump’s second term, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency revoked $80 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Adams’ City Hall has sued the administration for the funding.

Months later, the federal Department of Transportation said it was halting funds to the nation’s largest infrastructure project, which would bolster the busiest U.S. rail corridor underneath the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, as well as the Second Avenue Subway, also in Manhattan. Withholding about $18 billion, federal officials cited the New York City’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation by racial minorities in federally assisted contracts.

Trump has threatened to slash even more federal funds to the city if Mamdani was elected. In a Nov. 3 Truth Social post, Trump said, ""it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.""

Like other Democratic cities and states that have faced cuts to federal benefits, Mamdani has said the city could mount legal challenges to the cuts to recoup lost funds. Some cities and states have seen some success, such as Fresno, California, and North Carolina.

Arrest America’s mayor

Even before Mamdani won the mayoralty, Trump suggested arresting Mamdani and stripping him of his citizenship if Mamdani didn't assist on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani, born in Uganda, moved to the United States as a child and was raised in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.

Some right-wing members of Trump's party have called to review Mamdani’s citizenship process in an effort to denaturalize and deport him. Trump has threatened to arrest Democratic elected officials before.

After Mamdani won the election on Nov. 4, he spoke directly to Trump.

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said. ""So, hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.""

Mamdani's line drew perhaps the loudest roar throughout the night.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/03/USAT/87065195007-mamdani-trump.jpg?crop=3577,2012,x0,y335&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 18:56:54.343487

Issued via State Department cable, the rules dramatically expand longstanding public charge criteria and have prompted concern over fairness, discrimination, and broader impacts on global mobility.

Advocates and health experts warn that the move risks bias while supporters argue it protects American taxpayers and ensures self-sufficiency among newcomers.​

Broader Health Scrutiny Fuels New Exclusions

The new guidance, circulated by the State Department to US embassies and consulates worldwide in early November 2025, directs consular officers to consider whether chronic medical conditions-ranging from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological and mental health issues, and obesity-would require “hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth” of care, potentially justifying denial of US visas.

The directive lists specific conditions, yet signals that the list is not exhaustive, paving the way for even wider officer discretion. Obesity is flagged, with the memo noting its potential complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and hypertension.

Dependents’ health status now receives scrutiny as well, with visa officers urged to evaluate family members’ likelihood of creating future financial burden for US healthcare systems.​

Officials maintain the change is meant to “safeguard US resources,” targeting applicants deemed at risk of becoming a “public charge”-a historic category under American immigration law for those who may rely on government-funded support.

A Department of State spokesperson, speaking to Fox News, said, “The Trump administration has brought an end to the era of mass immigration… We continue to prioritise applicants who can demonstrate self-sufficiency.” Visa officers must now evaluate whether applicants have adequate means to pay for any future medical care over their expected lifetimes, without recourse to US public assistance.​

Expert, Advocacy, and Community Concerns

While health screening has always formed part of immigration processing-screening for communicable diseases and vaccination records-the new guidance marks a significant expansion. Immigration attorneys, including Charles Wheeler at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, question the subjective power given to individual officers, stating, “These decisions shouldn’t be based on personal bias or speculation, especially when officers aren’t medically trained.”

Wheeler also highlights a contradiction with the State Department’s own Foreign Affairs Manual, which prohibits denials based on hypothetical scenarios.​

Sophia Genovese, an attorney at Georgetown University, argues this “goes well beyond the traditional medical exam,” and that such criteria could exclude millions globally living with common chronic illnesses.

About one in ten people worldwide has diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases remain leading causes of death-a context that the new policy fails to address equitably.

Public health experts assert that many such conditions are treatable and should not justify immigration exclusion. Instead, the rules appear to favour young, wealthy, and healthy immigrants, threatening the US’s position as a destination for diverse talent, including international students, professionals, and family reunification.​

Immigration advocates, such as United We Dream and the American Immigration Council, have warned that the expanded “public charge” exclusion will disproportionately impact older applicants and those from lower-income backgrounds.

The cable encourages officers to consider projected medical costs and an applicant’s ability to pay these privately, further raising the bar for entry.

Critics also point to risks of discrimination unrelated to applicants’ actual ability to contribute to society, and challenge the ethical basis of denying entry for treatable health issues.​

Recent news reports and fact-checkers emphasise that while the US government retains authority to set entry conditions, abrupt expansion of these criteria under Trump could result in more rejections for reasons that intersect health, age, and financial status, not just merit or security.​

Immigration Context Under Trump: The Crackdown Deepens

This directive is only the latest in a series of immigration restrictions issued since Donald Trump’s second term began. The administration has tightened refugee admissions, raised H-1B and Green Card fees, and expanded enforcement actions targeting undocumented migrants.

Trump’s stated policy priority has included “restoring law and order” and “putting Americans first,” with a renewed push to reduce legal migration and overhaul pathways to citizenship.​

Prior measures include aggressive deportations, the infamous family separation policy at the Mexican border, bans on refugees from several countries, and substantial slowdowns or increases in scrutiny for highly skilled worker visas.

The expansion of public charge-related exclusions echoes previous attempts by Trump officials between 2018 and 2020 to amend how health, income, and reliance on public programs were evaluated in visa and Green Card cases.

Those earlier rules-which faced heavy legal challenges and public pushback-were subject to ongoing court battles and partial rollbacks, but the 2025 directive signals a fresh, more comprehensive crackdown.​

Legal experts note that while health has always been a component in visa processing, including communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases, no prior administration gave this level of discretionary power to consular staff, nor explicitly listed chronic, non-infectious conditions as grounds for visa denial.

The broader context reveals a systematic trend towards “merit-based” immigration and prioritising applicants who can demonstrate both immediate economic value and minimal long-term risk to welfare systems.​

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The Logical Indian believes that nations have a legitimate interest in protecting public health and managing resources, but blanket exclusions for treatable or common conditions undermine core values of fairness, empathy, and diversity.

Such policy risks stigmatizing those with chronic or age-related health issues, and could erode the principle of equal opportunity long associated with the American dream. Instead, immigration reform should balance fiscal responsibility with compassion and inclusion.

We urge policymakers to seek innovative solutions-such as insurance requirements, healthcare cooperation agreements, or tailored screening protocols-that allow for public interest protection without resorting to outright exclusion and bias.",https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-Social-Thumbnail-Template-20-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 03:17:16.413603

Last week, Little Village leaders called on Mayor Brandon Johnson to do more to enforce his executive order barring federal agents from using city-owned property for immigration enforcement operations, after a video surfaced allegedly showing vehicles with agents inside a parking lot of a Chicago public school.

In response, hundreds of students from Little Village Lawndale High School staged a walkout and protest march opposing the increased immigration enforcement.

DHS said there have been more than 3,000 arrests since the start of Operation Midway Blitz in September. Officials would not say when the operation is expected to end.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/27/27400870-d258-4de1-a176-24a5dfcf1773/thumbnail/1200x630/955e91a8c731bce77e1f20d1994d4773/gettyimages-1889004791.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 16:17:05.110802

Department of Homeland Security officials accused him of faking the medical emergency to keep agents from arresting his wife, who was wanted for allegedly stabbing a co-worker with scissors.

“I wasn’t letting go of my wife because they wanted to take her away,” Carlos Zapata, 24, told The Boston Globe in Spanish. He spoke to the newspaper on Friday, a day after his wife was detained in a chaotic traffic stop.

Bystanders shouted and recorded the confrontation as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers surrounded the family's car Thursday morning in Fitchburg, a city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Boston. Agents were seeking Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya, who was inside the vehicle with her husband and 1 ½-year-old daughter, according to a Homeland Security news release.

Widely circulated video shows Zapata behind the wheel, his body shaking and the whites of his eyes visible as masked agents reach into the car.

“He's having a seizure!” bystanders can be heard shouting.

Zapata told the newspaper that agents were pushing him and his wife together with the child between them, and that he blacked out after agents pressed on his neck.

“I had convulsions or something. I don’t know what they did to me,” he said. When he regained consciousness, he said, agents were handcuffing him.

Zapata said he and his wife are from Ecuador and entered the country unlawfully several years ago. They have since applied for asylum in a case that is pending and are authorized to work, he said. He was driving his wife to her job at Burger King when they were stopped, he said.

Homeland Security responded to the video Friday, saying: “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” in a post on social media.

“Medical personnel found there was no legitimate medical emergency,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department's assistant secretary, said in a news release. “He was even caught on video on his feet and coherent moments later.”

The department said officers were conducting a targeted operation to arrest Ojeda-Montoya for the alleged scissor stabbing and for throwing a trash can at her coworker in August. She was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, the Globe reported.

That was, until a massive immigration raid at the battery plant two months ago left Lee stunned and his business reeling. Federal agents handcuffed, chained and detained more than 300 Korean workers in an operation President Donald Trump later said he fully opposed.

The workers were flown home after a few days in immigration detention, but the effects of the raid continue to ripple out – from the tables at Lee's restaurant, to Hyundai headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, to Trump's White House.

The high-profile raid of a major global Fortune 500 company that had been aggressively recruited to Georgia infuriated many Korean Americans. According to Pew Research, some 1.8 million people in the United States trace their roots to South Korea, a nation that had long thought of itself as America's equal.

And it raised existential questions for Lee's business and for Korean Americans nationwide who didn't imagine that people here lawfully would be targeted by ICE, or that the Trump administration would pick a fight with a country that had invested billions in the U.S. economy.

Born in Philadelphia to Korean parents, Lee himself had worked 15 years for Hyundai before he launched his eatery, one of a dozen businesses in this Savannah suburb that opened to serve the Koreans and Korean Americans who came to work at the plant.

""I thought America was like my mother country, and Korea was like my father country,"" Lee said. ""So it's like my parents are fighting.""

Biggest raid in ICE history

A majority of the 300 Korean workers were present legally, on B-1 visas or under a visa waiver, that allowed them to perform equipment installation and to train American workers, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who represented a dozen of the workers.

However, some workers had worried their visas might not allow them to do the jobs they were assigned, given the increased enforcement under Trump, according to the Reuters news agency.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the plant on a warrant to target four Hispanic workers they suspected might be in the United States illegally. They detained 475 people there on September 4, in what officials initially touted as the largest single-site raid in ICE history.

ICE had a judge's permission to search the plant for records related to employing or harboring undocumented immigrants, according to the warrant obtained by USA TODAY. Prosecutors have yet to bring criminal charges in connection with the raid, according to a search of federal court records.

""ICE knew they screwed up,"" Kuck said. ""Within 24 hours ICE stopped speaking to the press about the biggest raid in its history. It definitely is still roiling the companies because I've been told none of (the workers) want to come back.""

The Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America is the company's first mass-production plant for electric vehicles and is slated to produce half a million vehicles annually. It's an $8 billion campus that is expected to generate 8,500 jobs in the region.

The raid specifically hit a Hyundai-LG Energy Solutions partnership: a plant under construction to make EV batteries for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 electric SUVs.

That plant was scheduled to open by early 2026, but the arrests of hundreds of workers will delay its opening at least two to three months, Hyundai Chief Executive José Muñoz has said.

In late October, Trump traveled to Asia, looking to negotiate new trade deals and mend fences with the Koreans. Speaking from Air Force One en route, Trump said he was ""very much opposed"" to the Hyundai raid.

""Some of these factories make very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment,"" he told reporters. ""They've got to bring people in with them for a period of time.""

After the raid, Trump offered to let the workers remain in the U.S., but only one accepted.

A longtime strategic relationship

Trump has good reason to want to smooth over relations with South Korea. Decades of business and cultural ties are at stake, along with billions of dollars in investment and tens of thousands of jobs.

Korea ranks as the United States' eighth-largest trading partner, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""South Korea has been a rising global power over the last two or three decades,"" said Chris Suh, associate professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Korean Americans feel that Korea finally made it.""

Seoul-based Hyundai was eager to show its commitment to the United States despite the raid.

Hyundai held its annual investor conference outside of Korea for the first time ever this year, opting for New York.

Muñoz, the CEO, opened Hyundai's September investor day with a message of ""sincere empathy"" for the workers who were detained. He underscored the company's investments and urged the United States and Korea to ""work on mutually beneficial solutions"" for foreign workers.

""Hyundai has been part of the fabric of the U.S. for nearly 40 years and has operated in Georgia for more than 15 years,"" he told investors, adding that the new battery plant ""is helping transform the region with long-term economic benefits for thousands of families.""

That's in part why the questioning and arrest of hundreds of workers who looked Asian dismayed many Korean Americans, said Mark Keam, president of the Korean American Institute.

""To say there is a sense of betrayal is an understatement,"" he said.

Keam, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has lived in the United States for 45 years, served as an elected state representative in Virginia and worked for the Biden and Clinton administrations. Korean Americans, like other Asian Americans, often deal with what he calls ""perpetual foreigner syndrome"" – the creeping feeling that, no matter their citizenship or background, they'll always be perceived by other Americans as foreign.

The raid ""has become the trigger that raised concerns that were just below the surface,"" said Keam, who travels the country in his role and recently visited Seattle, Chicago and New York City. ""In every one of those places, when I was with Korean American people, it was the biggest topic that comes up.""

Business is 'not recovering at all'

Tables at Lee's 92 Chicken franchise are emptier than they were before the raid. Lee estimates he lost a fifth of his business in its wake.

""It dropped dramatically,"" said Lee. ""It's not recovering at all.""

The city of Pooler lies between artsy Savannah and rural Ellabell, where Hyundai built its Metaplant campus. The fast-growing suburb sprawls over roughly 30 square miles, bursting with traffic and development.

""To be in the midst of Pooler to see all this growth, I was the only Korean woman and now I go to Costco and Publix and I hear my own language,"" said Kay Heritage, a longtime Korean American resident and owner of Big Bon Bodega restaurant in Pooler, which, among other things, serves a pizza topped with pickled Korean kimchi.

As Koreans and Korean-Americans flocked to the suburb, new restaurants blossomed to serve them, as did other businesses from estheticians and physical therapists to grocers and realtors, she said.

The community's loss of so many Koreans at once has hit hard.

""Especially the Korean restaurants felt the impact,"" she said.

The Hyundai campus promised a continuous flow of people and capital from Korea, said Suh, the professor at Emory.

""If these folks stop coming or are hesitant to come, that means less business, fewer people to participate in the Korean American community, fewer people going to church, buying food,"" he said. ""I think it's going to take awhile for people to feel the same way they did before the raid.""

In the kitchen of his restaurant, Lee makes Korean-style fried chicken by battering thighs and drumsticks, then brushing on a soy-garlic, sweet chili or spicy gochujang sauce, topped with green onions. He leaves plastic gloves on the tables for diners who don't want to get messy.

Now Lee is revamping his menu, looking to Americanize his fried chicken to mimic the Southern recipe, he said.

""Local people like it more, a little more saltier, and a little more sweeter,"" Lee said. ""We're gonna have to make things a little less spicy on the menu.""

He isn't angry about the raid, he said; but he is resolved.

""I can't do anything [about] the decision makers,"" he said. ""I've got to diversify my menus.""

""I stick up for Viktor Orban. Not a lot of people do, because they're, in many cases they're jealous. They wish they did what he did. They would have no problems if they did what he did,"" Trump said at a Nov. 7 White House meeting.

Trump said he's told European leaders they can learn from Orban's approach. Orban is a hero in the MAGA movement and Trump's critics have compared his second-term agenda to the playbook the Hungarian leader has used consolidate power in his country.

Orban has fought with the European Union over its support for Ukraine and his crackdown on independent institutions, in addition to the issue of immigration.

Trump said he gets along well with European leaders, but when it comes to border controls he agrees with Orban. European nations have made ""tremendous mistakes"" when it comes to taking in foreign nationals, he said.

""I happen to think he was right, because their whole fabric has changed,"" Trump said. ""I mean you go to some of the countries, they're unrecognizable now, because of what they've done. And Hungary is very recognizable.""

Trump said the autocrat had done a ""fantastic job"" and was a ""very powerful man within his country"" who's ""beloved"" by people who know him.

“Hungary’s government is systematically dismantling the rule of law and suppressing dissent under the guise of protecting national sovereignty,” Iskra Kirova, Europe and Central Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, wrote last month.

Orban said he was at the White House to ""open a new chapter"" and repair chilly relations. The Hungarian hard-liner spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022 and attended the NATO summit in Washington in 2024 but was never received at the White House by former President Joe Biden.

Trump acknowledged that Orban is a controversial figure, as he hosted the leader who's taken steps to limit press freedom and political opposition.

""He's respected by everybody, he's liked by some,"" Trump said.

Trump said he was considering an exemption for Orban's government to the sanctions the United States has put on Russian energy companies and that the war with Ukraine would be a topic of their discussion. Hungary is one of the largest remaining importers of Russian oil and gas in Europe and has come under fierce criticism by backers of Ukraine for his relationship with Vladimir Putin.

So once they are brought to South Sudan, that means that criminal activities will also increase,"" Martin Mawut Ochalla, a 28-year-old from Juba, told AP.","Deeply insecure and teetering on the brink of another civil war, South Sudan is frequently described as the most fragile state in the world.

Now the US, a global superpower, has tapped this young state as a destination for expelled foreign migrants, some of whom are violent criminals.

Washington began third-country deportations earlier this year, sending undocumented migrants to countries they are neither citizens of nor have any connections to.

While Central and South America have taken in the vast majority of those deportees, the program was also expanded to Africa, where some say Donald Trump is ""dumping"" people.

Experts now warn South Sudan, whose inability to deliver basic services as a state has already been compounded by sweeping USAID cuts, may be ""importing instability"" in a bid to appease its powerful ally.

World's poorest carrying burden

South Sudan, which is among five African nations taking in US deportees, was the poorest country in the world as of November in terms of GDP per capita.

Measured in net household wealth, the United States is the richest in 2025.

In July, South Sudan took in eight deportees from the US, saying it had ""responded positively"" to Washington's request as a ""gesture of goodwill, humanitarian cooperation and commitment to mutual interests"".

South Sudan's government, based in Juba, did not divulge details about what it would receive in return.

However, it has been reported that political concessions, including the removal of sanctions on ruling party members, and a chance to improve ties with the US were on offer.

Daniel Akech, a senior analyst for South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, said being in a protracted state of humanitarian and financial distress made the country particularly vulnerable to strong-arming by foreign actors.

""However, Juba's leadership also made a pragmatic, if reluctant, choice to use the deal as a potential pathway to ease crippling sanctions and begin rebuilding diplomatic relationship with the US,"" he told the ABC.

Since its formation in 2011, South Sudan has continually grappled with internal unrest, economic breakdown, and the spillover effect of the war in Sudan.

With more than 90 per cent of its 12 million population living in extreme poverty, it is heavily dependent on international partners for its developmental and humanitarian needs.

""By accepting this deal, the South Sudan government risks trading a potential diplomatic gain for a definite social loss,"" Mr Akech said.

""This situation adds further complexity to South Sudan's already fragile status, illustrating how external powers may exploit the country's internal vulnerabilities to advance their strategic objectives.""

Due to the large outflow of people from war-stricken neighbouring Sudan, South Sudan already hosts more refugees than it can handle, in addition to the 2.6 million of its own people who remain internally displaced.

According to the World Bank Group, South Sudan was hosting an estimated 900,000 refugees and asylum seekers from Sudan as of October, with 337,000 more expected to arrive before the end of the year.

Conditions in the refugee camps are squalid, with poor sanitation, outbreaks of diseases and severe malnutrition rife.

An 'equally agenda-motivated' government

Corruption is entrenched in the South Sudanese political sphere and has been a significant driver of the country's humanitarian challenges.

The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked South Sudan as the most corrupt country in the world in 2025.

A recent United Nations investigation documented how government-affiliated elitists had plundered its resources in an ongoing pursuit of ""partisan political ends"".

""The country has been captured by a predatory elite that has institutionalised the systematic looting of the nation's wealth for private gain,"" the report said.

Juba's acceptance of the US's third-country deportations is also likely to have been ""agenda-motivated"", Edmund Yakani, head of the civil society organisation CEPO, told the ABC.

""They viewed the deal on the deportees as a means to give them the opportunity of winning some gains from the US government.""

Unlike other African nations, such as Rwanda and Eswatini, the US did not make South Sudan a cash proposal — money, which if offered, could have been used to bolster the local economy and improve living standards.

Instead, Juba's chief demands included lifting US-imposed sanctions on South Sudan's Vice President Benjamin Bol Mel and his companies, sources have told Reuters.

Mr Bol Mel was planted into the vice-presidency this year after his predecessor, Riek Machar, was placed under house arrest by the government of Salva Kiir, the only president South Sudan has had.

""Interest in accepting the deportees [forms part of South Sudan's efforts] to drive the US administration on non-interference in Riek Machar's trial,"" Mr Yakani said.

In April, Washington also announced it was revoking US visas for all South Sudanese passport holders.

Reversing those visa revocations, reactivating a bank account at the New York Federal Reserve, and support for Mr Machar's prosecution were Juba's other demands, according to POLITICO, though the US has not agreed to any of them on paper.

Longer-term repercussions

The Trump administration has stated it aims to deport 1 million people annually, but analysis from the Migration Policy Institute suggests it will meet just half that target.

Mr Yakani said efforts to cover that shortfall could likely see Africa become more of a ""dropping ground"" for US deportees if African governments saw even part of their demands being met.

While South Sudan has so far taken in just eight migrants — one of whom is its own national — an influx of people would increase pressure on state institutions and essential services sectors.

Recent bilateral engagements between the White House and African leaders have hinged on the migration issue, reflecting what observers say is an attempt to transform Africa into a regional network for offloading people.

Increasing migrant numbers could have ramifications for African host countries' security, social stability and international reputation, according to Iman Al-Shaarawy from the UAE-based think tank the Future for Advanced Research and Studies (FARS).

Those include the ""division of the African stance"", deepening public anger, more resource scarcity, criminality, the perception that national sovereignty is being infringed upon, human rights criticism, and a ""re-creation of the narrative of Western dominance"" in a form akin to neocolonialism, she said.

Ms Al-Shaarawy also noted the White House's immigration-heavy focus on Africa risked creating an unequal relationship where ""certain nations serve as mere instruments to implement US domestic policy, with little regard for their local situations or their people's interests"".

Those deported to South Sudan so far have been described by the US as ""uniquely barbaric monsters"" and the ""worst of the worst"" criminals, including murderers, rapists and paedophiles.

""Some of them are criminals, they have been involved in crimes. So once they are brought to South Sudan, that means that criminal activities will also increase,"" Martin Mawut Ochalla, a 28-year-old from Juba, told AP.

Some could 'afford to' turn down overtures

The African nations of Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda and Eswatini have also agreed to take in US deportees, but some others have rejected the Trump administration's overtures.

Burkina Faso, a country long marred by terrorism and insurgency, as well as a close Russian ally, said last month it had refused the ""indecent"" request, which it called ""completely contrary to the principle of dignity"".

""Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is … Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion,"" its foreign minister then told local media.

Similarly, Nigeria said in July it would not cave in to pressure to accept undocumented foreign nationals, saying: ""We have enough problems of our own … we already have 230 million people.""

The US has reportedly also courted Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Benin, Libya, Angola and Equatorial Guinea.

""Some countries can afford to say no more easily than others,"" Mr Akech said.

The motivations of the five countries that have agreed to receive deportees vary.

While details of the individual deals the US has struck with them remain shrouded in secrecy and legally ambiguous, here is what we know:

The human cost

The welfare of those being deported has also been raised as a key concern by international organisations and rights groups.

In September, a coalition of more than 50 organisations penned a letter to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights calling for urgent action to protect migrants' rights:

""Forcible expulsions from the United States and transfer of migrants to countries in which they are not citizens or nationals, nor habitual residents, particularly without adequate due process or consideration of international protection claims, and including in circumstances in which they are transferred to situations of prolonged detention on unclear legal bases and in poor conditions, all constitute serious violations of international and African law and standards.""

The UN has said deportations of foreign nationals to third countries — many with troubling rights records, such as Eswatini — put them at risk of violations, including torture, arbitrary deprivation of life, and enforced disappearances, in the absence of legal avenues for those in need to seek.

While some African host nations have successfully negotiated the repatriation of migrants, Mr Akech said the main focus for weaker states such as South Sudan was fulfilling their diplomatic bargains with the US.

(Amaya Edwards — Santa Cruz Local/CatchLight Local)

CAPITOLA>> Throughout 2024 and early 2025, federal and out-of-state law enforcement agencies searched Capitola Police Department’s database of automatic license plate readers more than three million times, violating multiple laws. At least 190 were done by sheriffs offices and police departments running searches on behalf of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Capitola Police have confirmed that they violated state law in sharing data with out-of-state agencies, and said the violations were unintentional. Now, the department is increasing its oversight into how other agencies use its data.

“The City remains committed to transparency, accountability, and maintaining the trust of our community,” Capitola Police Chief Sarah Ryan wrote in a Nov. 7 email.

Capitola Police “does not assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in enforcing civil immigration law violations,” she said.

Capitola police lease 10 cameras from security company Flock Safety that capture license plates of passing vehicles. The data is stored on a Flock-administrated online database for 30 days. That database can be searched by Capitola Police officers and other law enforcement agencies, primarily to locate stolen cars or track down suspects.

Legally, Capitola Police can only share data with other law enforcement agencies within California. But the department had opted into a tool offered by Flock that allowed Capitola Police to search license plate data nationwide —- and allowed out-of-state searches of Capitola’s own data, a Flock spokesperson said in a Nov. 7 email.

Those searches violated California laws that forbid local and state law enforcement from sharing license plate camera data information with any out-of-state agency. Although ICE officials did not directly search Capitola’s data, public records suggest that out-of-state agencies performed searches on behalf of ICE.

Flock disabled nationwide sharing for public agencies in California in February to ensure compliance with state law, the Flock spokesperson said. But Capitola Police didn’t realize the data had been available to out-of-state agencies until a whistleblower alerted them in late October.

The violations of state law “were inadvertent and were not the result of any deliberate attempt by City staff to circumvent California law,” Ryan said by email. Ryan was sworn in as chief in December 2024, nine months after the Capitola City Council voted to lease the license plate cameras.

To ensure ongoing compliance with state law, Ryan has ordered a monthly audit of searches other agencies have conducted of Capitola’s data, she wrote.

Search records

The out-of-state searches were first identified by a retired security network analyst who lives in Santa Cruz County, after he started noticing the cameras around the area in April. “I was then immediately concerned about, okay, how are they storing the data?” recalled D., the security analyst, who asked only to be identified by his last initial out of fear of retaliation from law enforcement or Flock. He has worked in network security for 10 years.

“Especially given that they are a startup,” he added. “I’ve done security for startups, and I know that a lot of times, security is not as strong as it should be.”

The Atlanta, Georgia-based surveillance company Flock Safety says over 5,000 agencies in 49 states use its automated license plate reader. The cities of Capitola, Santa Cruz and Watsonville all operate Flock license plate cameras. Police chiefs have praised the cameras as an effective way to track down suspects of serious crimes and recover stolen vehicles.

But amid the increasing surveillance, arrest and deportation of unauthorized immigrants, city contracts with Flock have sparked pushback from activists, academics and state legislators.

In October, D. submitted a public records request to the Capitola Police for its network audit, a document that logs times other agencies have searched Capitola’s data, for 2024 and 2025. Those searches scoured databases of thousands of agencies across the country.

The logs Capitola provided D. left off the reasons out-of-state officers conducted each license plate search. But by looking at unredacted search logs from other police departments, D. was able to identify dozens of cases where out-of-state agencies searched Capitola data for immigration enforcement purposes.

For example, on Dec. 19, 2024, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia searched data from 5,770 agencies, including Capitola Police Department, and listed the reason as “ICE.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has tapped local law enforcement agencies to search license plate data in pursuit of unauthorized immigrants, 404 Media reported in May. 404 Media is a digital publication reporting primarily on cybersecurity, technology and surveillance.

A Santa Cruz Local analysis of data from the City of Capitola and two other cities showed more than 200 immigration-related searches of Capitola’s data from dozens of state agencies from January 2024 to February 2025.

On at least one occasion, a federal agency — the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — searched Capitola’s license plate camera data from a field division in Nashville, Tenn. The reason was listed at “Federal ERO Assist” — ERO likely referring to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

California’s SB 54, the 2018 California Values Act, prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Another law, SB 34, places limits on data collection from license plate cameras, and requires agencies to notify the public if their data has been breached.

License plate camera data may only be shared with other public agencies within California, according to legal guidance from California Attorney General Rob Bonta published October 2023.

But some law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, continued to conduct searches on behalf of ICE, Calmatters reported in June 2025.

For members of Get the Flock Out, a local anti-Flock group, the records from Capitola underscore long-running concerns about local use of license plate cameras.

Local police “may be trying to handle the data well, but we’re seeing from these public releases that actually they’re not handling the data well,” said Get the Flock Out member Ami Chen Mills. “I think this is beyond the capacity of our small communities to handle.”

Even if California police departments are prohibited from sharing data out of state, Get the Flock Out has ongoing concerns about Flock’s ability to access the data and its history of collaboration with immigration enforcement. When determining the trustworthiness of license plate camera programs, “we can’t just look at our communities and our police departments,” Chen Mills said.

Local police say the cameras help public safety. But as people are “being abducted and detained against our Constitution,” Chen Mills said, “who do we want to keep safe?”",https://santacruzlocal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251106flockcapJK_0001.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:17:20.188613

The recent ICE raids across the country and in Southwestern Pennsylvania, along with immigration enforcement agents in the city of Washington in recent weeks, have sparked fear among immigrants in the area.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Philadelphia office confirmed in an email on Friday that ICE operations have been taking place in the city of Washington.

The recent ICE raids across the country and in Southwestern Pennsylvania, along with immigration enforcement agents in the city of Washington in recent weeks, have sparked fear among immigrants in the area.

“Around last October, the fear level from 0 to 10 was at a 2. I’d say it’s now at an 8 or 9. It’s awful. People are frightened,” said the Rev. Jay Donahue, parochial vicar at St. Oscar Romero Parish in Washington. The parish includes Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Meadow Lands, where Donahue conducts a weekly Mass in Spanish for the church’s large Latino community.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Philadelphia office confirmed in an email on Friday that ICE operations have been taking place in the city of Washington.

Since Oct. 20, as many as 23 immigrants have been detained in the city of Washington and nearby communities, according to Erenia Karamcheti, director of social services at St. Oscar Romero Parish.

In one incident, three immigrants who work in construction were detained last week while stopping for breakfast at a restaurant on Jefferson Avenue.

Families of those who have been detained have turned to Karamcheti for help to locate where their loved ones are being detained, and when and if they will be given a fair hearing.

Karamcheti said a brother of one of the construction workers who was detained told her his brother, who speaks limited English, unintentionally signed a self-deportation letter and is being sent back to Guatemala.

“There’s been a very, very sharp uptick in enforcement around Pittsburgh,” said Joe Murphy, an immigration attorney with Allegheny Immigration Group. “People are being grabbed at courthouses – in one case, right in front of me – and you see people detained going to hearings, to Social Security offices and other government offices.”

ICE arrests have soared across the country since President Donald Trump’s second term began in January and the government launched a massive crackdown on immigrants.

Nationwide, ICE raids have occurred at farms, construction sites and other businesses, and near schools and other “sensitive locations” that, Murphy said, “has intentionally created an atmosphere of fear.”

Karamcheti has been using ICE’s online detainee locator system in an attempt to find where local detainees have been transported. She has tracked some to locations including Cambria County Prison and Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

City of Washington police and Washington County Sheriff’s office said they were not notified of ICE presence.

ICE operations are federal, and the agency isn’t required to notify local police of enforcement actions.

The sheriff’s office – which has a 287(g) agreement with ICE to perform some immigration enforcement duties – said its agency has received no request for assistance from ICE.

Concern over ICE activity has left families afraid to do everyday activities, said Monica Ruiz, executive director of Casa San Jose, a nonprofit support organization for Latino immigrants that has built a Rapid Response Network of trained volunteers who monitor and document ICE activity across Allegheny County and neighboring areas.

“They’re afraid to go to work, they’re afraid to send their kids to school or take them to school, and they’re scared to go to the store,” said Ruiz, noting detainments in Southwestern Pennsylvania have increased 250% since this time last year. “It has made it difficult for people to function and it obviously takes a toll on their financial stability, but it also takes a toll on their mental health.”

Karamcheti has shopped for groceries, cooked meals, and picked up prescriptions for those who prefer not to leave home, and she and others have arranged transportation for school students whose parents are afraid to drive them.

On a recent morning, Karamcheti stopped by the home of a woman whose husband, from Guatemala, has been detained at Cambria County Prison. The couple have a toddler, and she is fearful that her husband will be deported.

Earlier that week, she got a phone call from a mother whose son left for work on a Friday but didn’t show up.

“Then he called Saturday to tell her he was detained by ICE,” said Karamcheti.

Attendance at the church’s regular health, dental, and legal clinics has dropped. Donahue said 15 people had signed up to attend a health clinic operated by volunteer doctors earlier this week, but only three showed up.

Karamcheti said she had thought the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies would be aimed at violent criminals, and is alarmed that people without criminal records are being swept up.

“They are not taking criminals. They are taking hard-working people,” said Karamcheti. “These are good people, without any criminal record, who just want to work and take care of their families.”

Ruiz agreed.

“What’s important for people to understand is that this was supposed to be about detaining criminals, and what we’re seeing is that’s not what’s happening,” she said.

According to statistics from the Cato Institute, about 65% of those detained had no criminal convictions and 93% had no violent convictions, and most convictions among those with a record fell into minor offenses such as immigration or traffic violations.

Donahue said attendance at Mass at Miraculous Medal has remained steady, but noted it has dropped at other churches in the Diocese of Pittsburgh and other congregations serving the Latino community.

On Sunday, about 200 people filled the pews at a Mass that acknowledged Dia de los Muertos, a celebration of life that honors and remembers deceased loved ones.

“It was one of the biggest church services we’ve ever had,” said Donahue, who was delighted at the turnout and a celebration held later, where church members filled an altar with photos of deceased loved ones, marigolds, glowing candles, salt, and offerings of favorite food and drink. “Luckily, Mass attendance has not died down, but people are not showing up at events like they used to.”

The Catholic Church steadfastly defends the rights of immigrants.

In an email statement, Bishop Mark Eckman, bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, said

“As the Catholic Church teaches, every person has dignity and worth as a child of God. The Church supports the right of nations to protect their borders while also affirming the fundamental rights of migrants and refugees to safety, family unity, and the opportunity for a dignified life. Our parishes continue to accompany those in need through prayer, pastoral care, and acts of compassion.”

Donahue, who regularly writes letters to congressional representatives and senators decrying the current U.S. anti-immigration policies, has accompanied congregants to immigration court and lobbied for the release of a church member who had been detained in Moshannon for 3 1⁄2 months before he was released.

Earlier this week, Donahue served as a translator at the immigration hearing of a parishioner from Mexico who faced deportation and a re-entry ban after her visa expired. The woman, who is engaged to a U.S. citizen and is planning a 2026 wedding, won her case.

The parish also is serving as caregiver for two children whose mother was detained and deported to Mexico, he said.

At St. Oscar Romero, a parish group launched a GoFundMe this summer to raise money for rent, food and bills for families who have lost financial resources, including its immigrant church members.

Donahue worries that the human rights and dignity of immigrants are being ignored.

“What are we doing here? The key is to see that these are human faces, not bunk bed numbers,” said Donahue, referring to a church member who was detained at Moshannon and was called “Up 25” for 3 ½ months because he occupied the top bunk of bed 25 in a 38-bed unit. “It’s dehumanizing.”

Ruiz said immigrants, who pay taxes, “bring a lot of economic value to our community.”

“Think about places in Washington County where immigrants have worked on farms and in other occupations. They’re ingrained into that community. Let’s be honest, they’re not getting any free things, they’re contributing,” she said.

Ruiz, too, is dismayed by what she calls the “inhumane” treatment of documented and undocumented immigrants who are being picked up every day in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

“This is not who we are. I don’t want this to be who we are,” said Ruiz. “We have to be better than this.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/washington.ogdennews.com/images/sites/3/2025/11/08073437/Image-5-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:17:12.236907

The Department of Homeland Security says agents have arrested more than 3,000 people in Chicago since immigration enforcement actions began there in early September. Immigrants have been changing their routines because of the crackdown, sometimes missing work or school. And as Adora Namigadde and Aleja Hertzler-McCain of Religion News Service report, some people are also staying home from church.

ALEJA HERTZLER-MCCAIN: Three men sit on plastic chairs in a basement in Chicago.

ADORA NAMIGADDE: They say Mass at their parish feels like home in Guatemala, but now they're too afraid of being detained by ICE if they go to church.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) We decided to stay home, go to work and rest. And on Sundays, it's better to stay at home because we have these dreams.

NAMIGADDE: Dreams of making sure his daughter back home gets a good education.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: These men agreed to be interviewed as long as we don't give their names because they fear deportation. And we agreed not to name their parish because they worry it could be targeted.

NAMIGADDE: About a year ago, the men were in a severe car accident. One family member died.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) When we needed it most, they helped us a lot. And many, many sisters here from this parish came to us to lift our spirits when we were in bed.

NAMIGADDE: The men tell us Mass is the one place they found community since coming to the U.S.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: And not feeling safe enough to go weighs heavy.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) It hits close to your heart. Well, it feels like - it feels horrible.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: After the accident, the parish's migration ministry helped them pay rent and living expenses until they could go back to work as roofers.

NAMIGADDE: The volunteer who helped make that happen doesn't have legal status, either. He came to the U.S. from Mexico 28 years ago.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Through interpreter) Many of us are afraid to go to work, to go to a restaurant, to go to church because everyone, everybody is afraid of encountering ICE.

BLASE CUPICH: We need to be honest, as a country, about why people are here and why they do not have documents.

NAMIGADDE: Cardinal Blase Cupich is the Archbishop of Chicago.

CUPICH: It's because we have failed, and our legislators on both sides of the aisle have failed to enact comprehensive immigration reform.

NAMIGADDE: The Department of Homeland Security tells NPR that agents use discretion when enforcing immigration law at houses of worship, and agents need approval from a supervisor before taking action in locations such as churches.

UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing in Spanish).

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: In September, St. Oscar Romero Catholic Parish on Chicago's South Side dedicated its three-mile jubilee pilgrimage to praying for migrants. Fr. Carmelo Mendez says Mass attendance there is down about 40%.

CARMELO MENDEZ: We give them the opportunity to come to church, but if they don't feel comfortable, I believe God understands their concerns and their fears.

NAMIGADDE: At the Mass after the event, Mendez preached that all people are equally loved by God.

MENDEZ: (Through interpreter) May God Almighty, Jesus, the immigrant, Mary of the journey inspire us to recognize that we are only passing through here. No matter where you were born, no matter when you migrated, our citizenship is not here but in the presence of the lord.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: At a different parish in one of Chicago's northern suburbs, church attendance is down by about 25%.

NAMIGADDE: The deacon there says the surge of federal agents has made many people scared to go.

UNIDENTIFIED DEACON: We have a group of people bringing the Holy Communion to those people who are in fear for any deportation or any detention.

NAMIGADDE: He's trying to fill in the spiritual gaps by ministering to people online and in their homes. Now, there's a ministry for people to pray the rosary on Zoom, and he brings food to some parishioners several days a week.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: The church remains on high alert.

UNIDENTIFIED DEACON: Before they start the Masses, people watch outside the parking lot, the street if they see any movement or any immigration officer. And before the Mass ended, also, they do the routine walking in the street to protect our community.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: Despite these understandable fears, some immigrants are going to Mass anyway.

NAMIGADDE: Back at the Guatemalan men's parish in Chicago, we also spoke with a woman whose adult children have been begging her to stay home.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) I told them they weren't going to take that away from me.

NAMIGADDE: She also asked that we withhold her name.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: She used to attend Mass every day, but now she only goes once or twice a week.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) Seeking God is the most important thing for me. They know that because they say that the church is my second home.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: This grandmother came to Chicago 38 years ago and serves her parish with care, washing linens used at Mass.

NAMIGADDE: She wants her kids to trust that God will keep their parents safe from deportation.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) I tell them that's not going to happen. God is with us. Go to church more, seek God that you may feel more comforted by Him.

NAMIGADDE: She survived cancer and the loss of her home. She says she can't show weakness because she'll make her kids weak.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: But sometimes she feels the weight of it all.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter, crying) I have my children, and I don't see myself separated from them. No. No, I don't think I could endure that. I've endured a lot that has happened to me because I say my God has given me strength. But they don't have the strength that I have, and maybe not the faith.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: God, she says, is her strength. For her, going to church is worth the risk. For NPR News, I'm Aleja Hertzler-McCain.

NAMIGADDE: And I'm Adora Namigadde in Chicago.

Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.

A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.","The secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, reportedly authorized the purchase of Spirit Airlines jets before discovering the airline didn’t actually own the planes – and that the aircraft lacked engines.

The bizarre anecdote was contained in a Wall Street Journal report released on Friday, which recounted how Noem and Corey Lewandowski – who managed Donald Trump’s first winning presidential campaign – had recently arranged to buy 10 Boeing 737 aircraft from Spirit Airlines. People familiar with the situation told the paper that the two intended to use the jets to expand deportation flights – and for personal travel.

Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.

Complicating matters further, Spirit, which filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time, in August, did not own the jets and their engines would have had to be bought separately. The plan has since been paused, according to the Journal.

Meanwhile, Democrats on the House appropriations committee said in October that during this fall’s record-long government shutdown, the DHS had already acquired two Gulfstream jets for $200m.

“It has come to our attention that, in the midst of a government shutdown, the United States Coast Guard entered into a sole source contract with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation to procure two new G700 luxury jets to support travel for you and the deputy secretary, at a cost to the taxpayer of $200m,” Democratic representatives Rosa DeLauro and Lauren Underwood wrote in a letter to the DHS.

A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.

Congress had previously approved Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” in July, which dedicates roughly $170bn for immigration and border-related operations, a sum that makes ICE the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

In September, the Guardian reported that the Trump administration was moving immigrants detained as part of its deportation agenda in ways that violated their constitutionally protected rights, often by plane.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438f496ef1aa3d27bab5fca03ba26f0d7485178/423_0_2695_2157/master/2695.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39dd7b1bb501da9b43cab15213406191",N,,2025-11-08 14:17:03.131540

The other major operator of private jails is CoreCivic. Earlier this year Scripps News visited a CoreCivic jail in Kansas that is ramping up operations to eventually begin housing immigrants.

But the company has other detention centers already open, leading to a jump in revenue of 18% last quarter. The company's earnings have sharply increased since 2020.

With the Trump administation aiming to detain thousands more immigrants, both companies see room to bring in even more money from the deportation push.

""When you look at the growth that we're expecting for 2026 it's one of the fastest growth years, year over year, that we've experienced in a very long time as a company,"" said Patrick Swindle, President of CoreCivic.

Speaking before members of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson accused President Donald Trump’s administration and federal immigration officials of violating the “dignity of all Chicagoans” with violent raids, and he asked the human rights council to hold a special session to discuss “the worsening human rights crisis in the United States.”

“I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said in the virtual address. “No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal – or they are meaningless.”

Since the Department of Homeland Security launched its “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement operation in the Chicago area in early September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have descended on worksites, dragged residents through neighborhood streets and used chemical irritants to disperse protesters – tactics that a federal judge said “shocks the conscience.”

On Wednesday, immigration officers arrested a teacher after chasing her onto the grounds of a private preschool. The incident appears to be one of the first instances during Trump’s second administration in which immigration officers entered and made an arrest on school grounds – once considered off limits to enforcement actions. DHS disputed that the woman was arrested inside the school, saying she was detained in a “vestibule.”

In his remarks, Johnson characterized these kinds of incidents as stemming from a “moral failure” on the part of the Trump administration.

In a statement to the Washington Post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin blasted Johnson for “demonizing ICE and CBP law enforcement,” adding that federal officers are facing increasing assaults as they use more aggressive tactics to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

“Mayor Johnson has shown time and time again he does not care about the innocent American lives taken at the hands of gang members, murderers, drug traffickers, and rapists who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said. “Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.”

The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.

The enforcement operation is part of the administration’s broader crackdown on “sanctuary cities,” which have long drawn Trump’s ire. Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

“Operation Midway Blitz” has resulted in the arrests of 3,000 undocumented immigrants throughout Illinois and northern Indiana, according to DHS.

Johnson said the deportation campaign has had a destabilizing effect on the city, and the harms extended beyond immigrant communities.

“In Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood – a proud, predominantly Black community – federal agents carried out what can only be described as a military-style raid designed for social media spectacle,” Johnson said. After the raid, DHS published to social media a video, set to cinematic music, of the operation.

“Helicopters circled overhead. Doors were kicked in. Homes were destroyed. Immigrant residents were detained in one van, while Black families – including young children – were held in another,” Johnson added.

Authorities said that they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Two of the 37 immigrants arrested in that raid were gang members, and dozens of U.S. citizens’ apartments were targeted.

On the city’s West Side, federal agents placed a Black man in a chokehold and forced him to the ground just steps from the doors of the legal nonprofit Westside Center for Justice, Johnson said. Earlier this week, federal agents rammed into the vehicle of Dayanne Figueroa before taking her into custody “for no apparent reason,” he added.

“These are not isolated incidents. They are reminders that the fate of our communities – Black, Brown, immigrant – is bound together,” Johnson said. “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. And in Chicago, we will stand united in defense of our shared dignity, safety and freedom.”

Johnson also sought to draw the U.N. body’s attention to the lapse in federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. In Chicago, roughly 1 in 5 households receive food assistance, according to official state data.

“As someone with first-hand experience, I can tell you how humiliating it is when you open the refrigerator and you have nothing to eat,” Johnson said. “In the wealthiest country in the world, there is no reason why our federal government should allow hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to go hungry.”

Friday’s address comes after the Trump administration skipped a review of its human rights record, known as the Universal Periodic Review. In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.

Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action. Members can also hold crisis meetings, known as “special sessions.”

In his remarks Friday, Johnson slammed the Trump administration for “fail[ing] to meet even the most basic expectations of transparency and accountability before this council.”

“By refusing to submit its Universal Periodic Review report and declining to appear for its review, this administration seeks to evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights – just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-11-08 22:16:50.048296

Baum",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/rights-groups-sue-trump-admin-over-use-of-israeli-spyware-to-target-immigrants/,"Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.
Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.
“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.
Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.
“Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”","Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 30 in federal court by Just Futures Law and the Center for Constitutional Rights, demands that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comply with Freedom of Information Act requests related to their contracts with tech companies Cellebrite and Paragon Solutions. Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.

Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump’s second term.

“The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people’s phones, extract data, and surveil people’s daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release.

“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

CBP did not respond to Prism’s request for comment.

ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. The agency currently holds two active contracts totaling $11 million with the company, which markets phone-cracking tools that allow law enforcement to extract data from locked devices, according to the attorneys’ press release. CBP, which also holds at least 20 Cellebrite software licenses, has partnered with the firm since 2008, the press release states.

Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. According to technical researchers, the tool can hack into smartphones, including encrypted messaging apps, without the user’s knowledge. ICE entered into a contract with Paragon in September 2024, but the Biden administration paused the agreement due to national security concerns after issuing an executive order limiting the use of spyware by federal agencies. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract.

Members of Congress sent a letter last month demanding answers from ICE about its use of Graphite, calling the secrecy surrounding the program “deeply alarming.”

Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Family members have had their devices searched during home raids. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid.

The level of intrusion remains unclear, which is precisely what the lawsuit seeks to change.

“We should not have to go to federal court to force the government to hand over these records,” Ian Head, manager of the Open Records Project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in the press release. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.”

Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.

Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations.

“In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241666688-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:44.833662
