Since June, Trump and his anti-immigration architect Stephen Miller have used LA as both testing ground and showcase for their shock-and-awe immigration and speech crackdown, sending teams of heavily armed and masked agents to raid workplaces and homes and then deploying federal agents and the National Guard to tamp down resulting protests.

This strategy has not been a success. Troops themselves have reportedly questioned their deployment and the administration has faced multiple lawsuits and some court losses amid cratering public support for its immigration actions – but it has produced some of the higher arrest numbers that Miller demanded, and the administration seems committed to continuing course. As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement begins receiving appropriations in excess of most of the world’s military budgets and goes on a hiring blitz, other jurisdictions have reason to worry about a franchising of the LA model. New York City is an obvious and prime candidate, with some inside Homeland Security already pointing to pressure to ramp up arrests.

A source familiar with internal discussions inside ICE’s New York City field office said agents are under pressure to increase arrests, with teams of federal agents otherwise assigned to tasks like financial and drug crimes being pulled into immigration enforcement. This has not yet translated to hyper-aggressive operations in New York City like the raids in LA, but within the agency the groundwork is being laid to be able to launch that type of campaign as soon as an order comes down.

That mounting concern has run up against relative silence from Mayor Eric Adams and his administration, who have largely reaffirmed they will “follow the law,” but stayed away from many specifics about whether and how they’re planning for the eventuality of an LA-style federal response here, alarming some advocates. New York City has faced enforcement, but it’s so far been largely confined to arrests at the immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza. “We do still continue to reach out and ask questions, often to hear kind of vague responses,” said New York City Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Committee on Immigration.

West Coast nightmare

In LA, teams of heavily armed and often masked agents have for months set up checkpoints and raided worksites and areas where undocumented immigrants are thought to congregate, including Home Depots, which White House Deputy Chief of Staff Miller infamously implored field agents to to focus on instead of just targeting criminals. The constant presence and apparently random nature of the operations has caused people to pull back from aspects of public life. Parents aren’t dropping off kids at school and once-bustling public areas sit empty.

Multiple federal judges have found that the sweeps are indiscriminate and unconstitutionally profiled people based on factors like race and location, an argument bolstered by the fact that multiple U.S. citizens have been detained in the raids. An analysis of ICE data showed that an average of 88 people were being detained per day in a three-week period before a temporary restraining order came down. In addition to suspected immigration violators, federal agents arrested over 160 protesters, some who’d engaged in violence, but most of whom were not charged with any violent offense. The crackdown has had and probably will have huge deleterious impacts on the city’s economy.

In Los Angeles, parents aren’t dropping off kids at school and once-bustling public areas sit empty.

This approach has now spread to Washington, D.C., where Trump recently took over the local police force and began deploying federal officers and soldiers, who’ve reportedly engaged in hundreds of indiscriminate stops, checkpoints and arrests. Unlike the LA deployments, the rationale there has expanded beyond immigration to general criminal enforcement, adding another layer to the possible pretexts for potentially bringing roving federal patrols and troops to New York City. Immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in the capital are reportedly deserted as residents fear the indiscriminate enforcement, which has often involved a mix of federal agents at the exits to metro stations asking people for identification.

That approach could be easily ported over to New York City, with hundreds of subway stations that act as congregation points for people of all walks of life. Trump has now explicitly pledged to deploy troops in other cities, starting apparently with Chicago. A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that Trump’s use of the military in this manner was an illegal attempt to create “a national police force with the President as its chief,” blocking for now additional deployments in California, though the administration seems poised to move ahead with plans elsewhere. Federal law enforcement entities like ICE and the Border Patrol with their own military-style units, though, are free to keep operating.

Trump immigration coordinator and attack dog Tom Homan came to New York City in July to promise that the agency would “flood the zone.” (ICE acknowledged but did not respond to detailed questions about its planning for New York City.)

Mayor Adams was asked about these remarks and whether he’d had any conversations with Trump about it in an unrelated press conference the next day and answered mostly in terms of why such an operation would be unnecessary. “New York is moving in the right direction in public safety. (If) the federal government wants to assist us in really navigating some of the laws around easy accessibility to automatic weapons… I'm not part of the group that says we don't want to work in coordination with the federal government, but we don't need anyone to come in and take over our law enforcement apparatus,” the mayor said. That framing struck many as incomplete, if only because D.C. – experiencing record-low levels of crime – did not need this intervention either.

This leaves Adams in an awkward position. The former cop with the law-and-order calling card seems inclined to help fellow law enforcement, yet has watched ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol trigger disorder where they’ve focused their efforts. Public stats show that most arrestees have no criminal record. At the same time Adams, as an incumbent, is the underdog in a mayoral race in which front-runner Zohran Mamdani has gone the complete opposite direction, pledging (perhaps unrealistically) to halt ICE operations in New York City altogether.

So far, the relationship between the city and federal administrations has been something like an uneasy truce with occasional skirmishes. Adams has met multiple times with Homan, once declaring that he and the Trump official had the “same goal.” The Justice Department in February moved to drop pending federal charges against him in exchange for cooperation on immigration enforcement, though he denies the existence of any deal. In April, his administration moved to allow a new ICE office on Rikers Island, a policy since blocked as a result of a City Council lawsuit.

These overtures don’t mean all smooth sailing. Adams was named personally in a long-shot federal lawsuit filed by Trump’s Justice Department late last month seeking to overturn New York City’s sanctuary provisions. City Hall has sued the federal government over the sudden withdrawal of $80 million from the city’s coffers, and filed several legal briefs opposing ICE arrests of New York City students.

The NYPD’s options

Many sanctuary rules are not up to Adams but embedded in city law. In March, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch was reportedly forced to step in and block an operation that Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry had planned with Homan, which would have entailed NYPD directly assisting hundreds of ICE personnel in raids on two of the city’s makeshift migrant shelters. Tisch reportedly stopped the raids on the grounds that such cooperation was illegal.

“My impression is that Jessica Tisch has a more normal, traditional attitude toward constitutional law,” mused Daniel Feldman, a professor at John Jay and former Assembly member who’s an expert in administrative law and enforcement. “If, for any reason, she's under pressure to mobilize the NYPD, perhaps in lieu of federal troops, I would assume what they would do is pretty much what the National Guard folks did in LA, which is, yeah, they were there, but didn't really do anything. They just stood there.” Still, even in LA which has its own sanctuary laws, some advocates contended that local law enforcement were de facto assisting ICE under the mission of preserving public order – not slapping the cuffs on immigrants but enabling federal raids by keeping onlookers at bay.

“If and when they decide they're going to send more people here to do an LA-style enforcement action, I think what we're going to see is communities standing up and fighting for their neighbors,” said Murad Awawdeh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. Awawdeh expressed frustrations over what he described as a relatively muted administration response to their urging for public reassurances.

“In New York City, we have very comprehensive non-collusion laws on the books. We want to make sure that the City of New York knows that it is not the job of the NYPD to collude with immigration enforcement,” said Awawdeh. “What we would be urging this administration to be doing is ensuring that as New Yorkers are being attacked, that they do what's in their power to defend them.”

How to protect

What would it look like for the city to not just decline to help ICE but actively constrain it and provide help to its targets? Avilés said requiring agents to show their faces is a start. “We see (ICE agents) don't like to follow the law. It doesn't have anything to do with safety. So then the question becomes, can we get these agents to unmask themselves?” said Avilés. In addition to identification, there are pushes to have the city ensure that agents actually have warrants and stay out of sensitive locations, such as schools.

How city law enforcement could or could not intervene would be up to debate and possibly litigation. “The (federal) government can't command the police to help, they can demand that the police not obstruct, or demand that any state not obstruct. Obviously, the line between failure to cooperate and obstruction is one that gets fought over,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and current law professor at Columbia who’s written about interactions between federal and local law enforcement. “To the extent that warrants are legally required, I can imagine a jurisdiction enforcing that constitutional framework. But beyond that, no, federal officers get to do what is legally appropriate to carry out federal law, and can't be barred from doing so by a state or local government.”

Feldman, the John Jay professor, said it might be feasible for the city to not interfere with immigration operations but engage in other constitutional functions. “Where I think the NYPD can legitimately, practically speaking, operate is protecting protesters. As we know, there have been physical conflicts between ICE and some protesters,” he said. “Planning how to prevent that from happening, and assuring safety and exercise of civil liberties at the same time, that should be the focus of their attention at this point.”

Even if those plans are being developed, Feldman doesn’t necessarily agree with the advocates that the city should be talking about them. “Frankly, if I was the (NYPD) commissioner, I wouldn't reveal my plans either. Why? I mean, there's potentially such a fraught, if not adversarial, position with the federal government, why do you want to tell them in advance what your strategy is, to empower them to figure out a counter-strategy?”

If I were in the police department, one, I would not think that I can devise a detailed playbook given the number of uncertainties. And two, to the extent that there’s any playbook, I sure as hell wouldn't tell anyone.

Daniel Richman law professor at Columbia and former federal prosecutor

Richman agrees. “If I were in the Police Department, one, I would keep my principles in mind but not think that I can devise a detailed playbook given the number of uncertainties; and two, to the extent that there’s any playbook, I sure as hell wouldn't tell anyone,” he said. He pointed out that despite the signals that Trump and Homan might ramp up operations in New York City, there are still a lot of uncertainties about how they might do that – whether workplace raids or checkpoints or more of the courthouse arrests. Plus, despite the recruitment campaign, beefing up the already overstretched federal law enforcement force “is not going to happen quickly. The city obviously has to prepare for that surge, but they have quite a lot of time to do that.”

Whatever the reason, City Hall is treading carefully with what they say. Often-chatty Adams officials did not respond to questions I sent.

In a statement, City Hall spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak wrote that “New York City continues to be a place where sensitive locations – like our schools and churches – are safe and free of non-local law enforcement. The Adams administration has also ensured that, at this time of heightened anxiety, New York City provides the largest immigrant legal services and support network in the nation,” pointing to the city’s new Office to Facilitate Pro Bono Legal Services and funding for know your rights efforts and legal representation. She did not address on the record questions about the NYPD’s directives around contending with the possibility of, for example, ICE workplace raids and roving patrols.

While waiting for the city to roll out something more concrete, advocates are focusing more on the ground level. “Communities, institutions, rapid response network, mutual aid groups, and organizations across the city and the state are actually creating their own plans of how they're going to respond to what's happening,” said Awawdeh, though he declined to get into specifics on the record. They’re holding their cards close to the vest, while hoping that behind the city’s silence is a plan, too.",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2025/09/02/GettyImages_2228666321/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 06:57:02.461061

The men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba have criminal convictions, but had all served their sentences and been released in the US, their lawyers said. The US deported them to the small southern African country without warning in July, claiming they were “depraved monsters”.

The US has sent migrants to several third countries, as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up deportations. Eight men were sent to South Sudan in July, Rwanda accepted seven migrants last week and Uganda has agreed to take in asylum seekers. The US also deported 252 Venezuelans, first sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador for four months.

The lawyers said they have been unable to have private conversations with their clients, who are allowed one short video call a week in the presence of prison staff. A local lawyer representing the five men has been prevented from visiting them in the maximum security Matsapha correctional centre.

The Emaswati lawyer filed a case demanding access to the men, but a hearing scheduled for Monday was postponed when the judge did not show up, said Alma David, who is representing the Yemeni and Cuban men.

When the men, who had all been in the US since they were children, were first deported, US assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed they were “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.”

In response, Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Smith, said: “The government has not refused the return of any of our nationals to Jamaica,” and would work to return any deportees to the country. She later said that diplomats visited Orville Etoria in prison in Eswatini on 21 August and found him “in good spirits”.

Etoria, 62, came to the US legally in 1976, aged 12, said his lawyer Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1997. He obtained an undergraduate degree in prison, was released on parole in 2021 and was working in a men’s shelter and studying for a master’s degree in divinity when he was deported.

He had been reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as required and obtained a Jamaican passport earlier this year at their request. His relatives told Unger he had first been put on a plane to Jamaica and then removed, she said, adding that his being sent to Eswatini “makes no sense”.

Relatives of the four other men did not want their identities disclosed, their lawyers said. The Yemeni man, who served 22 years in prison for murder and was released in 2020, had been living in Michigan and is 70, his lawyer Alma David said.

The Cuban man, who served nine years for murder, is in his mid-50s and had been working for a plumbing company in Florida. He was released from prison after serving a separate sentence for grand theft auto in 2012, David said.

She spoke to both men while all five deportees were with guards and the prison chief, who said that only the US embassy in Eswatini could grant access to the men. “Since when does the US embassy have jurisdiction over Eswatini’s national prisons?” she said.

Tin Thanh Nguyen, representing the Vietnamese and Laotian deportees, said the men were aged 34 and 45 and released in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The Laotian man’s relatives reported he was starting to show signs of depression.

“The United States is outsourcing their detention … to purge the United States of immigrants and refugees and to make a spectacle of deportations,” Nguyen said.

Last month, a group of Eswatini NGOs challenged the country’s acceptance of the deportees on constitutional grounds, arguing that parliament had not been consulted and that the men’s human rights were being violated.

An Eswatini government spokesperson said they would not be responding while court cases were under way.

“Weeks ago, I arranged an on-site meeting this coming Friday at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s headquarters in Springfield, Va., to connect with the nonpartisan career intelligence professionals who serve our country every day. These are Virginians – my constituents – and I have held more than a dozen similar private listening sessions with NGA and other intelligence agencies in Virginia under both Democratic and Republican presidents, including during President Trump’s first term. Engagements such as these are a core part of my responsibility to provide oversight and support to our intelligence community and hear from Americans who live in Virginia, and they have never been questioned or politicized, until now.

“Over the weekend, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer discovered the unpublicized, classified visit and launched a campaign of baseless attacks against both me and NGA Director Vice Admiral Trey Whitworth for hosting what has always been considered a routine oversight meeting. In response to Loomer’s criticism, political appointees canceled the visit, just the latest example of an administration seemingly desperate to please Loomer, a figure with a long history of extreme and outlandish fringe views, including 9/11 denialism, anti-Muslim harassment campaigns, and associations with white supremacists.

“This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan staff at NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that protects our national security. Members of Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe. This should concern Republicans as well as Democrats: if routine oversight can be obstructed for political reasons, no member of Congress is immune.

“Let me be clear: I will never be deterred from carrying out my constitutional responsibilities. The business of government and the security of our nation will not be dictated by extremist attention-seekers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that it would pay state and local law-enforcement officers' salaries and benefits in places where governments join a program to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The offer, which begins October 1, would also provide up to 25% of an officer's salary in overtime costs and bonuses to agencies based on performance, DHS said.

President Donald Trump's administration aims to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and has intensified enforcement across the country.

The Republican-led Congress in July passed a spending package that gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement $75 billion over a little more than four years, a funding surge that ICE plans to use to ramp up operations.

The Trump administration has worked to expand so-called 287(g) immigration-enforcement partnerships with state and local law enforcement, and their number has risen from 135 to 958 since Trump took office in January, DHS said.

Immigrant advocates say the agreements sow mistrust of law enforcement in immigrant communities and could lead to racial profiling.

The partnerships fall under a program called the Task Force Model that was terminated under former President Barack Obama but restarted in Trump's second term. It allows state and local law enforcement to make immigration arrests while performing their policing duties.

In a June fact sheet, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights called it ""the most dangerous and invasive"" form of the Task Force Model. A Justice Department investigation in 2012 found that North Carolina sheriffs illegally stopped and detained Latino drivers under the program.

Nayna Gupta, policy director of the pro-immigration American Immigration Council, said tasking local police with immigration work means they spend less time on ""actual public safety threats in our own communities and immigrants become scared to report actual crimes.""

Yadira Córdoba’s arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Aug. 20 in San Antonio has rattled Nicaragua’s exile community.

Córdoba, a Nicaraguan mother demanding justice for the murder of her 15-year-old son during a May 30, 2018 march in Nicaragua, was arrested during a routine immigration court appointment on August 20. She has been in the United States seeking asylum since 2023.

The U.S Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment.

Córdoba is scheduled to have an expedited removal hearing on September 22. The American Immigration Council describes this process to be one by which noncitizens can be removed from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.

Undocumented immigrants placed in expedited removal proceedings are entitled to access the asylum system if they express fear of persecution, torture, or of returning to their home country.

The process can be flawed for a number of reasons, including a lack of judicial review and a backlog of asylum applications.

Córdoba faces the real risk of being deported to Nicaragua, where she has been targeted for persecution by the Ortega-Murillo regime.

Human rights organizations warn that her life is in danger if she is returned to Nicaragua.

Following the death of Córdoba’s 15-year-old son, Orlando, she became one of the most prominent voices demanding justice for victims of state repression.

She has since then been a high-profile figure in Nicaragua’s pro-democracy movement and is a member of the Mothers of April, a group that has become a symbol of resistance, demanding accountability and an end to the authoritarian regime in Nicaragua.

“The Mothers of April is made up of women whose children were killed. These are not politicians. They are schoolteachers, nurses, housewives—ordinary people who became activists because of unbearable loss. Their demand is simple: truth, justice, and guarantees of non-repetition,” said Félix Maradiaga, an opposition activist, former presidential candidate, and now professor at the University of Virginia and Johns Hopkins University.

Maradiaga added that “Yadira Córdoba is a name very well known in Nicaragua. She always spoke from a nonpartisan and nonpolitical perspective around the issues of justice, human rights, and democracy.” After her son’s assassination, she became a relentless spokesperson for the Mothers of April.

Córdoba’s activism came at a cost. She faced threats and persecution, forcing her into exile in Costa Rica in 2019. But even there she was not safe. “Let’s remember there have been assassination attempts against Nicaraguan activists there, and even killings. She did what any of us would do—flee to save her life,” said Maradiaga.

There have been documented assassination attempts and killings of Nicaraguan exiles in Costa Rica as part of a pattern of transnational repression orchestrated by the Nicaraguan government. Recent prominent cases include the killing of activist Roberto Samcam in 2025, the killing of Jaime Luis Ortega in 2024, and attacks against Joao Maldonado in 2023, though Costa Rica's president has denied Nicaraguan operatives are active in the country.

In 2023, Córdoba resettled in the United States, where she sought protection under U.S. asylum law. Her detention this month stunned Maradiaga and other exiles. “This was a shock to many of us,” he said. Yadira is an internationally recognized case. Her testimony has been recorded by the European Union, by the Organization of American States, by the United Nations, even raised before the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. government itself, during the first Trump administration, issued statements condemning the assassination of her son.

“That one of the most well-documented cases of extrajudicial killing could now result in deportation—it is absolutely outrageous.”

According to Pablo Cuevas, who’s part of Córdoba’s legal team, the issue is rooted in a technicality. “She entered undocumented and did not have a credible fear interview upon entry. That was later corrected, but ICE is treating it as a violation rather than a technicality”, explained Cordova.

The risk Córdoba faces if deported is severe. “Her life would be at risk,” Maradiaga said. “The regime does not need intelligence reports to know who Yadira is. She has spoken at international forums. If she is returned, she would not only be persecuted but could be disappeared.”

The Sandinista regime has built an extensive surveillance apparatus known as SORM, a Russian-designed system that compiles data into a centralized database. Anyone interrogated by authorities is entered into this system, which can pull information from social media, police records, and even neighborhood informants aligned with the Sandinista Party. Something as minor as a traffic ticket or a Facebook post from years ago can trigger inclusion. Local party members feed names into community lists, which are then passed up to regional representatives, ultimately creating a nationwide registry of citizens under scrutiny. For Nicaraguans who return after migrating—whether deported or coming back voluntarily—the consequences vary.

Maradiaga pointed out that “economic migrants are often forced to sign documents pledging not to criticize the regime. But political cases are different. Those deported activists simply disappear. Their families are too afraid to speak. That’s the kind of police state we are facing.”

He drew a sharp contrast between the U.S. government’s public support for Nicaragua’s pro-democracy movement and the flaws of its asylum system. “Asylum should be hard, and it should be rigorous. But the problem is inconsistency. Some cases without strong documentation are approved, while cases like Yadira’s—with extraordinary proof—are denied. That is what confuses and frightens people.”

Maradiaga himself continues to live in limbo in the U.S. after being released and banished from Nicaragua along with 221 other political prisoners in February 2023. “Neither my wife’s asylum case nor mine has been approved after seven years, despite recognition from U.S. authorities. We have chosen to stay in the asylum system as an act of solidarity with fellow Nicaraguans, to experience its flaws from within, and to speak with legitimacy.”

For Maradiaga, Córdoba’s story is more than an individual case. “When you see humble women—mothers who never imagined becoming political actors—stand up to the dictatorship, you see the real Nicaragua,” said Maradiaga. Yadira’s story is not only about her son Orlando. It is about a movement of mothers who refuse to be silenced.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31e29df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+144/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F93%2Fa4%2F93621b374a64ab4c82938d1c8891%2F64954120-0a2b-49f5-b3c3-2c38fe92a0ec.JPG,N,,2025-09-03 01:57:16.350706

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday filed a joint motion to dismiss an appeal filed by the federal government in 2023 after a district judge sided with the state.

The joint motion cited changes in immigration policies after President Donald Trump replaced former President Joe Biden in January.

“President Trump has since taken office and directed the Department of Homeland Security to reexamine certain immigration policies from the previous administration,” the motion filed at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.

The motion came after lawyers from the state and federal governments asked the Atlanta-based appeals court in June to put the appeal on hold while they tried to resolve it.

Moody filed a lawsuit in September 2021 as she and Gov. Ron DeSantis made a high-profile issue of criticizing the Biden administration’s handling of immigration issues. The lawsuit involved “parole” policies, which related to undocumented immigrants being released from detention after crossing the country’s southwest border.

U.S. District Judge T. Kent Wetherell issued two rulings in 2023 that said policies, known as “Parole Plus Alternatives to Detention” and “Parole with Conditions,” violated federal law. But the Biden administration appealed the rulings.

Before attorneys asked in June to put the case on hold, the appeals court had directed the two sides to file additional briefs and pointed to an executive order that Trump issued after taking office Jan. 20. The executive order said the Department of Homeland Security should “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States.”

“Given the change in presidential administration and immigration policies, we must determine whether this case has become moot. … A case becomes moot when events after its commencement ‘create a situation in which the court can no longer give the plaintiff meaningful relief,”” the appeals court said in calling for the additional briefs, partially quoting a legal precedent.

The state argued in the case that the Biden administration violated laws through “catch-and-release” policies. The state contended that undocumented immigrants moved to Florida and created costs for such things as the education, health-care and prison systems.

The appeals court, however, questioned whether Florida had legal standing to challenge the immigration policies. That came after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas and Louisiana did not have standing to challenge certain immigration policies.

DeSantis in January appointed Moody to the U.S. Senate to replace Marco Rubio, who became U.S. secretary of state. DeSantis subsequently appointed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, to serve as attorney general.

The DeSantis administration has taken a series of steps designed to help Trump’s efforts to deport people in the country illegally. Those steps included opening a controversial detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2023/10/GettyImages-1415662791.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-03 01:57:32.862052

“The termination of any of the current countries that receive Temporary Protected Status directly affects our immigrant communities in San Francisco,” said District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder, who introduced a non-binding resolution urging the California federal delegation to urge Congress to establish a permanent pathway for Temporary Protected Status holders.

The Trump Administration’s order has been upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and on Sept. 8, the immigrants will lose their protected status – this includes their ability to remain in the United States or to work here legally.

By Fielder’s side at the steps of City Hall were Supervisors Myrna Melgar, Chyanne Chen, Shamann Walton, and Bilal Mahmood. The resolution itself which passed with a unanimous vote on Tuesday afternoon at the Board of Supervisor meeting.

“As your city attorney, I can share with you that our office is doing everything we can to stand with our immigrants because we know how far our country has fallen from the promise of the Statue of Liberty,” said City Attorney David Chiu, whose office filed amicus briefs on July 29 highlighting the “deep integration into American society” of the city’s immigrant population, and warning that ending their status would “cause irreparable harm” to communities.

“We have to stand together,” Chiu said to the 30 or so people who attended the rally.

Created by the U.S. Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, “Temporary Protected Status” protects nationals from countries undergoing civil wars or environmental disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, drought and epidemics from deportation.

A Temporary Protected Status designation has to be renewed every six, 12 or 18 months, depending on the arrangement.

Kimberly, a city worker attending the rally, said that this had been true for her mother, Janeth. She arrived in Los Angeles at age 23, after being displaced from Honduras by Hurricane Mitch.

Violence, disease, and infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane made returning to Honduras dangerous enough that the U.S. kept renewing TPS status for Hondurans.

Like many other TPS holders, the only way for her mother to stay in the United States was to renew her TPS status every two years, Kimberly said. Progressing from TPS status to a green card or citizenship is difficult, and her mother wasn’t able to obtain either.

“The only thing that they give you with TPS is work authorization and deportation protection and to be legally present here,” Kimberly said. “So it literally is just for labor.” Her mother spent the last two decades working as a nurse at Kaiser.

But Sept. 8, 2025 will be her last day. Her mother is not willingly retiring, Kimberly said. Her employment is terminated because of the Aug. 20 court ruling that allowed the Trump administration to proceed with terminating TPS status for several countries, including Honduras.

NPR reported that the decision will impact some 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans, whose TPS designations are set to expire on Sept. 8, as well as some 7,000 people from Nepal whose designations will expire on Aug. 5. Once their designations expire, these immigrants will face deportation.

Kimberly said that her mother has been working seven days straight ahead of her layoff on Sept. 8. “She needs all the money that she can get because she has a mortgage,” Kimberly said.

Her mother has no idea if she can get her money from her retirement account or her pension in any way if she’s in Honduras. She doesn’t know if she will have a chance to be called into work on Monday, Sept. 8. She doesn’t have any family in Honduras anymore.

“Mentally, she’s not okay,” Kimberly said. “Physically, she’s still showing up.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2215-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 02:56:28.339808

The effort comes as Donald Trump’s presidential administration cracks down on immigration across the country, ramping up arrests and deportations. Immigration courts are also already dealing with a huge backlog of roughly 3.5m cases that has ballooned in recent years.

The news conference came just moments after President Donald Trump told reporters ""we're going in"" when asked about a slew of circulating rumors that the White House has plans to send troops to Chicago to address crime.

""Rumors have been swirling about what the White House has planned, and sifting fact from fiction has been increasingly difficult because Donald Trump's administration is not working in coordination with the city of Chicago, Cook County or the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said.

While no official announcement has been made, the Trump administration has reportedly been planning to send National Guard members to Chicago in a similar manner to how they were deployed to Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, according to the National Guard and other outlets.

Pritzker confirmed to NBC Chicago’s Mary Ann Ahern just hours before the press conference that ICE agents will be conducting enhanced immigration enforcement operations in the city in coming days.

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker said in the exclusive interview. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

Pritzker also said during the press conference that he believes staging for federal enforcement in Chicago has ""already begun.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke alongside Pritzker during the news conference Tuesday.

Trump is ""worried about the wrong border,"" Johnson said. ""We don't have an immigration crisis in Chicago, we have a gun crisis.""

""Violence in Chicago is not because we have too many immigrants, it's because we have too many guns,"" Johnson said.

In anticipation of increased enforcement efforts, Johnson last week signed an executive order, declaring Chicago police will not collaborate with military on police patrols or civil immigration enforcement.

In its media release, the AHRC noted that the planned amendments were part of the government’s response to recent High Court rulings, including NZYQ v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs (2023), 280 CLR 137; [2023] HCA 37.

NZYQ determined that indefinite immigration detention – where there was no real prospect of a detainee’s removal from Australia becoming practicable within the reasonably foreseeable future – was unconstitutional.

NZYQ resulted in the release from immigration detention of hundreds of detainees whom the relevant authorities could not deport to their country of origin, as well as legislative changes permitting the government to pay third countries to accept non-citizens under third country reception arrangements.

According to the bill’s explanatory memoranda on Parliament’s website, the proposed changes would provide that the rules of natural justice would be inapplicable to third country reception arrangements. Specifically, the rules would not apply to the Commonwealth’s exercise of executive power to:",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/070/0372_638924668925437492.png,N,,2025-09-03 01:57:24.551170

In a 2-1 decision, the District of Columbia circuit court of appeals allowed a lower court decision in favor of Slaughter to take effect, rejecting the Trump administration’s request to delay the ruling during its appeal.

The court said that FTC commissioners may not be fired by a president without cause, saying that the law on this point has been clear for nearly a century.

“The government is not likely to succeed on appeal because any ruling in its favor from this court would have to defy binding, on-point, and repeatedly preserved supreme court precedent,” two judges wrote in the majority opinion.

A third judge, Trump appointee Neomi Rao, dissented, saying that federal courts likely have no authority “to order the reinstatement of an officer removed by the president”.

Slaughter said on Tuesday that she was heartened by the ruling and that Trump is “not above the law”.

“I’m very eager to get back first thing tomorrow to the work I was entrusted to do on behalf of the American people,” Slaughter said in an emailed statement.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The FTC enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws.

Trump had appointed Slaughter to her first term on the FTC in 2018. Joe Biden designated her as the FTC’s acting chair in January 2021, and Biden appointed her to a second term in 2023, which is to end in September 2029.

A federal judge ruled in July that the Trump administration’s attempt to remove Slaughter did not comply with removal protections in federal law.

Under the FTC’s bipartisan structure, no more than three of the five commissioners can come from the same party. Congress placed restrictions on the hiring and firing of commissioners in an effort to insulate the agency from partisan politics.

Trump fired the two Democratic commissioners on the FTC in March, in a major test for the independence of regulatory agencies.

The dispute over Trump’s firing of Slaughter and fellow commissioner Alvaro Bedoya will likely end up before the supreme court, which ruled 90 years ago that FTC commissioners may be dismissed only for good cause, such as neglecting their duties. Bedoya formally resigned in June to take another job and is not part of the case.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9595704e6540623da8f5f0c2d852cb65fd9546fe/120_0_3634_2907/master/3634.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbb4b51f4dcbd8f78ff122f7e03bd78f",N,,2025-09-03 01:57:36.961900

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama.","MEXICO CITY (AP) — More than 14,000 mainly Venezuelan migrants who hoped to reach the United States have reversed course and turned south since U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown began, according to a report published Friday by the governments of Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica.

The phenomenon, known as “reverse flow” migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.

Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border between Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023, when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.

Friday's report, published with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97% this year.

Migrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia by those countries' ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%), and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally enter the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and others.

That changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.

A U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.

Now, those migrants who were still trying to reach the U.S. have reversed course, traveling back to South America. Around a quarter of those interviewed planned to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Colombia and other South American nations spent years pleading for aid from the international community to cope with the brunt of Venezuela's migratory crisis, before many of those same migrants began moving toward the United States.

“Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said in a statement. “We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.”

The shift marks a radical reversal in one of the biggest mass migrations in the world.

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama. From there, migrants pay between $260 and $280 to ride on precarious boats packed with people back to Colombia.

They take two different routes. Most island hop north of Panama through the Caribbean Sea, landing in the small town of Necocli, Colombia, where many started their journeys through the Darien.

Others travel south by sea along a jungled swath of Panama and Colombia through the Pacific Ocean, where they are dropped off in remote towns or the Colombian city of Buenaventura. The region is one of the most violent in Colombia, and the lack of state presence is filled by warring armed groups.",https://epsilon.creativecirclecdn.com/christianindex/original/20250902-080352-c60-AP25240816520264.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 23:56:33.518705

WASHINGTON – U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem today terminated multiple Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees for consuming pornographic content during work hours while on government issued devices. During the investigation into FEMA employees’ conduct, DHS discovered that almost half of FEMA’s employees regularly log into social media platforms while performing their taxpayer funded duties.

“Today, I am announcing that multiple disgraced FEMA employees were fired for using their government devices to consume sexually explicit content while on the job. These individuals had access to critical information and intelligence and were entrusted to safeguard Americans from emergencies—and instead they were consuming pornography. In at least one case the pornography consumed was racially charged and involved bestiality,”said Secretary Noem. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended. For decades some of these bureaucrats engaged in every act imaginable instead of safeguarding the American people from natural disasters. That ends now.”

On July 12, 2025, The DHS’s Insider Threat Operations Center (ITOC) identified that one employee typed explicit and sexually charged phrases into a chatbot website from his government devices for the purpose of having the comments read back to him in an accent.

On August 1, 2025, another individual, a government contracted employee also stationed at the command center was identified by the ITOC as accessing Reddit.com 578 times over a 30-day period. It was revealed that he was engaged in extensive interactions with individuals online, viewing explicit sexual content while on his work devices. He accessed content that included graphic photographs and videos. On several occasions, he used his government computer to chat online with members presenting explicit content.

DHS actively investigates the misuse of devices throughout the agency to ensure that employees are not abusing federal devices or sharing classified or sensitive information.

That includes border czar Tom Homan, who collaborated with anti-Muslim hate group The United West on his “Defend the Border” project, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, whose white nationalist views first came under scrutiny during Trump’s first term.
The report also refers to multiple posts from DHS that promote the idea of forging friendships or strengthening familial bonds over the targeting of immigrants.
And it notes that the agency’s social media strategy has been celebrated by known white supremacists like activist Jared Taylor, who called the posts a “remarkable change” during an episode of his podcast in August.
That’s certainly one way to describe the Department of Homeland Security’s embrace of racist propaganda to further the Trump administration’s draconian anti-immigrant agenda.","Under President Donald Trump, the Department of Homeland Security’s social media channels are beginning to look like a white nationalist content mill, churning out bigoted, jingoistic schlock.

A recent report from Hatewatch, the extremism watchdog run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, shows how the agency and top Trump administration officials have ramped up their promotion of white nationalist or anti-immigrant social media posts since June, when the agency reposted anti-immigrant propaganda that originated from an avowedly racist social media account.

MSNBC has noted the agency’s propaganda in the past, including their use of cruel memes that vilify nonwhite immigrants and of American artworks to promote themes of ethnic cleansing.

The Hatewatch report takes a comprehensive look at these incidents since June, citing an apparent increase in racist propaganda as part of what the watchdog calls “an escalating trend in American immigration enforcement toward overt use of white nationalist and anti-immigrant myths to recruit personnel and justify departmental operations.”

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment on Hatewatch’s claims. When asked last month by NBC’s Los Angeles affiliate about the campaign, the DHS called its digital strategy “bold and effective.”

Here’s one example Hatewatch flagged:

In one recruitment poster, published on Aug. 11, a white Uncle Sam caricature in the style of a Norman Rockwell painting stands at a crossroads of directional signs that include such phrases as “INVASION,” “CULTURAL DECLINE,” “HOMELAND” and “LAW & ORDER.” The poster includes the caption “Which way, American man?” — which appears to be a nod to the influential white nationalist text Which Way Western Man? by William Gayley Simpson. Published by an imprint associated with the neo-Nazi National Alliance, the book is a reflection and critique of society from Simpson’s travels. While critical of some aspects of society, it largely frames Western civilization as superior and veers into sexist and antisemitic commentary.

To some online observers, like author and conspiracy theory expert Mike Rothschild, this apparent nod to an unabashed bigot was hardly subtle:

The report notes that multiple Trump administration figures in senior leadership roles have ties to racist organizations or have been known to espouse white nationalist themes. That includes border czar Tom Homan, who collaborated with anti-Muslim hate group The United West on his “Defend the Border” project, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, whose white nationalist views first came under scrutiny during Trump’s first term.

The report also refers to multiple posts from DHS that promote the idea of forging friendships or strengthening familial bonds over the targeting of immigrants. And it notes that the agency’s social media strategy has been celebrated by known white supremacists like activist Jared Taylor, who called the posts a “remarkable change” during an episode of his podcast in August.

That’s certainly one way to describe the Department of Homeland Security’s embrace of racist propaganda to further the Trump administration’s draconian anti-immigrant agenda.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250902-Stephen-Miller-aa-157-b72349.jpg",N,,2025-09-02 22:56:45.747582

WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a public comment opposing the Department of Labor’s (DOL) proposed rule, “Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,” which would eliminate hard-won wage and hour protections for millions of the nation’s paid caregivers, who are disproportionately Black and Brown women and are among the poorest workers in the labor force.

The proposal would change the definition of in-home “companionship” services under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal law whose protections include a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay for work performed beyond 8 hours in a single day, or 40 hours in a single week. Under the proposed new definition, millions of home care workers would no longer be entitled to those protections. Additionally, while agencies and other third-party employers of home care workers currently are required to comply with the FLSA, DOL proposes to excuse those employers from the statute’s requirements. These actions would undo DOL’s 2013 regulations, which extended FLSA protections to home care workers after decades of exclusion.

“Even though they currently are entitled to receive the minimum wage and overtime, home care workers are among the most vulnerable in our nation’s labor force, facing wage theft and unsafe working conditions, and living in poverty,” said Gillian Thomas, senior counsel in the ACLU Women's Rights Project. “The Department of Labor ’s proposed rule change would strip away the meager economic security that FLSA coverage provides to these essential workers, who take care of our elders and our loved ones with disabilities. By enabling greater exploitation by corporate home care providers, DOL will drive more workers out of a field already facing a profound labor shortage and deprive millions of families of the care they rely on.”

ACLU’s comment highlights that the exclusion of home care workers from the FLSA’s protections stems directly from the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. When Congress passed labor laws like FLSA and the Social Security Act in the 1930s, lawmakers carved out from those statutes’ coverage domestic workers as well as agricultural workers—the two fields in which formerly enslaved people and their descendants were most likely to work—in order to win southern lawmakers’ support. Although Congress eventually amended the FLSA to bring such workers within the law’s protection, DOL did not fully effectuate that intent until it issued regulations in 2013.

“Today, home care workers still are disproportionately women of color, and most of whom are women and people of color, provide essential care yet remain among the poorest and least protected in our economy. Rescinding DOL’s 2013 rules not only will make them much poorer—it will shamefully revive a legal exclusion firmly rooted in racism and misogyny,” added Thomas.

DOL’s 2013 rule recognized the realities of the modern home care industry, in which workers are well-trained professionals who are supporting families of their own, and in which third-party agencies—rather than care recipients themselves—employ care workers, reaping billions in profits. Entitlement to minimum wage and overtime pay has provided economic security for a workforce made up overwhelmingly of women, and particularly Black women and immigrant women. Such protections not only have helped lift wages for one of the nation’s lowest-paid professions, but also has ensured stable, quality care for seniors and people with disabilities.

ACLU’s comment further explains that the proposed rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act. DOL has effectively suspended the 2013 rule without proper notice and comment, and its justifications for abandoning longstanding protections are arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful.

The ACLU urges the department to preserve the 2013 rule, which corrected a historic injustice, advanced gender and racial equity, and strengthened the home care workforce.

The Trump administration has decided to get more immigration judges from an unprecedented source: the military.

On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that the Pentagon plans to send up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to temporarily run immigration courts around the country. Some of them could receive their new assignments as early as next week.

The arrangement would help the Trump administration tackle a backlog of immigration cases. But military lawyers have little or no experience with immigration law. And some former military lawyers worry the plan isn’t even legal. It “should raise all sorts of alarms,” Daniel Maurer, a former Army attorney who also taught law at West Point, told me recently.

I spoke with Maurer in July, after President Trump first hinted that he’d be open to the idea of deploying military attorneys—known as Judge Advocate Generals, or JAGs—as immigration judges in Florida. That idea, floated by Gov. Ron DeSantis, hadn’t yet come to fruition. “There is no clear precedent for what DeSantis and the president are doing,” Mark Nevitt, a law professor at Emory University who served as a Navy JAG, told me at the time.

“This would be unlawful,” added Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles who was an Air Force JAG.

In particular, VanLandingham said, turning military lawyers into immigration judges would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that bars US troops from participating in civilian law enforcement or “executing the laws,” unless otherwise authorized to do so by the Constitution or Congress. It’s “frightening,” VanLandingham said of the plan, because “the use of military courts to hear civilian cases is the essential component of martial law.”

“What you end up with,” Maurer added, “is military officers under federal control who are running civilian courts.”

The former JAGs gamed out several scenarios (see my previous story for more details), but they couldn’t imagine any in which it would be legal for the Pentagon to turn military attorneys into immigration judges, that is, unless Congress were to pass a law that allowed it, or Trump invoked the Insurrection Act, which gives the commander in chief power to deploy military forces within the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence.

And if Trump went that route, there would be no turning back, according to Raquel Aldana, a law professor at the University of California, Davis: “The reality is that, once he does, the powers can be unlimited and we are in a military state.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2Sept2025_JAGs.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-02 19:56:31.124090

Postliberal democracy, by contrast, embraces the values of liberalism but tries to insulate itself from the will of the people.
Standing between these two models is old-fashioned liberal democracy.
If the frustration of liberal democracy is that it tends to proceed in half-steps, its virtue is that it advances on more secure footing.
At that point, hopefully, the values of liberal democracy — including an appreciation of the virtues of immigrants — might begin to reassert themselves.","It’s been 10 years since Angela Merkel, as German chancellor, memorably declared “Wir schaffen das” — “We can do this” — in the face of the mass migration crisis sweeping Europe. Last week The Wall Street Journal reported, “For the first time, populist or far-right parties are leading the polls in the U.K., France and Germany.” Similar parties are already in power or in government in Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, to say nothing of the United States.

To say the West’s turn to the anti-immigrant right was the predictable result of Merkel’s calamitous decision to open Germany’s borders does not mean there aren’t still lessons to be learned from it — not least by the world’s most clueless of all major political parties today, the Democratic Party.

Starting around 20 years ago, perhaps earlier, liberal democracy gained two half-siblings: postliberal democracy and preliberal democracy.

Preliberal democracy accepts the practice of regular elections but rejects most of the core values of liberalism: free speech and moral tolerance, civil liberties and the rights of the accused, the rule of law and independence of courts, the equality of women and so on. Turkey under the long reign of Recep Tayyip Erdogan typifies this type of democracy, as did Egypt under the short reign of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi.

Postliberal democracy, by contrast, embraces the values of liberalism but tries to insulate itself from the will of the people. The European Union, with its vast architecture of transnational legislation, is one example of postliberalism; international courts, issuing rulings where they have no jurisdiction, are another; global environmental accords, like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (signed by the Obama administration but never ratified by Congress), are a third.

Standing between these two models is old-fashioned liberal democracy. Its task is to manage the tension, or temper the opposition, between competing imperatives: to accept majority will and protect individual right, to defend a nation’s sovereignty while maintaining a spirit of openness, to preserve its foundational principles while adapting to change. If the frustration of liberal democracy is that it tends to proceed in half-steps, its virtue is that it advances on more secure footing.

That’s the ideal that much of the West essentially abandoned in recent years. On the political left but also the center-right, postliberal policymaking largely determined the outcome of the two most basic political questions: First, who is “us”? And second, who decides for us?

Merkel never sought the approval of German voters to relax the country’s immigration laws and take in nearly a million people over the space of a year. Americans didn’t elect President Joe Biden on any promise to let in millions of migrants over the southern border. Post-Brexit Britons never thought they’d bring in an astounding 4.5 million immigrants to a country of just 69 million between 2021 and 2024 — under Tory leaders, no less.

No wonder the reaction to years of postliberal governance has been a broad turn to its preliberal opposite. Not all right-wing populist parties are the same, and there are meaningful differences between, say, the ill-disguised fascism of the Alternative for Germany and the pragmatic conservatism of Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister. But all of them have risen on the same core complaint: that postliberal governments used obscure legal mechanisms or simply ignored the law to attempt a social transformation without society’s explicit consent. In America, it’s called replacement theory.

Liberals and progressives typically dismiss replacement theory as antisemitic, racist demagoguery, and no doubt there are plenty of bigots who believe it. But maybe some measure of understanding ought to be extended to ordinary voters who merely wonder why they should be made to feel like unwelcome outsiders in parts of their own country or asked to pay a share of their taxes for the benefit of newcomers they never agreed to welcome in the first place or extend tolerance to those who don’t always show tolerance in return or be told to shut their mouths over some of the more shocking instances of migrant criminality.

What most of these voters are feeling isn’t racism. It’s indignation at having their normal and appropriate political concerns dismissed as racism. And as long as politicians and pundits of the traditional political establishment treat them as racists, the far right is going to continue to rise and flourish.

There’s something partisans of the center-right and center-left could do: Instead of discreetly murmuring that, say, Merkel or Biden got immigration policy wrong or that it was morally and economically right but politically foolish, they can grasp the point that control over borders is a sine qua non of national sovereignty, that mass migration without express legislative consent is politically intolerable, that migrants ought to be expected to accept, not reject, the values of the host country and that hosts should not be expected to adapt themselves to values at odds with a liberal society.

At that point, hopefully, the values of liberal democracy — including an appreciation of the virtues of immigrants — might begin to reassert themselves. Until then, the preliberal tide will continue to surge.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/03/multimedia/02stephens-vjtf/02stephens-vjtf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 20:56:59.273521

Private prison operator CoreCivic, which owns and manages the 2,560-bed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, confirmed to The Bee that the facility is now operational.

“We have begun receiving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees at our California City Correctional Facility (CCCF) in response to an immediate need from the federal government for safe, humane and appropriate housing and care for these individuals,” Ryan Gustin, senior director for public affairs for CoreCivic, said in a statement.

The California City Immigration Processing Center, as it is now known, is the third privately-operated ICE facility in Kern County and the seventh in California. The Geo Group private prison operator runs Mesa Verde in Bakersfield and Golden State Annex in McFarland. The reopening was first reported by Bakersfield’s Eyewitness News KBAK-CBS.

It’s unclear how the facility was able to open without a 180-day public notice as required by state law.

California City Mayor Marquette Hawkins and City Manager Christopher Lopez did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

In an interview with The Bee on Thursday, Lopez said the facility would likely be subject to SB29. The state law prohibits a city or county from approving an immigration detention center, including the reuse of existing building owned by private prison operators, unless the public agency has provided 180-day notice to the public and solicited and heard public comments on the action.

On Thursday, Lopez said he had “no information” on the negotiations between ICE and California City on a longer-term operation contract to re-open.

The privately-operated prison opened in the late 1990s by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became known as CoreCivic. In the early 2010s, ​CoreCivic​ had a contract with the federal government to house federal detainees who awaited trial or had pending immigration cases. It later became a privately operated state prison known as the California City Correctional Facility, which closed in 2024 after the state ended its for-profit prison contracts.

Gustin, of CoreCivic, said the reopening will create about 500 new jobs and generate more than $2 million in property taxes to the city.

ICE did not respond to specific questions about when the facility opened. In a statement, a spokesperson said “ICE has worked with private detention operators, local governments, and other federal partners to identify and bring online over 60 new detention facilities to include California City.”

Immigration advocates warned during public comment at a June 24 California City council meeting that the facility’s opening would lead to increased community arrests in the greater Kern County region.

According to a study by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, immigrants are more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE in counties with more detention beds. In communities with more than 850 ICE detention beds, there was a 6.4 times higher likelihood of arrest, researchers found.

California City had concerns with reopening

Immigration rights advocates have shown up to California City council meetings throughout the summer to voice opposition to the facility’s reopening. City officials have not discussed the facility’s reopening at a public meeting since June 24, according to a review of council meeting agendas.

“We’re troubled by California City turning a deaf ear to the objections voiced by community members and advocates voiced at previous meetings,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, manager of the Valley Watch Network with the nonprofit group Faith in the Valley.

Faith in the Valley estimated as of Tuesday afternoon that there are already 300 detainees at the California City facility that are being quietly transferred from Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde. The group alleged in a social media post Tuesday afternoon the facility opened “without a valid permit.”

Lopez said Thursday CoreCivic had submitted a site plan review — a necessary step to receive a business license. The facility already had a conditional use permit in place, he said. A Sept 2 planning commission agenda confirms the site plan review was pending.

In a July 29 letter to CoreCivic, Lopez told the private prison operator that the facility “posed a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of the community of California City.” The city listed four concerns related to insufficient emergency communications, increased demand for police and fire services, as well as paramedics and ambulances for medical emergencies.

The letter also listed concerns with a fire inspection and basic radio test that found the building wasn’t up to code.

Gustin of CoreCivic said the company’s leadership team had an “open line of communication” with California City officials. He said CoreCivic had addressed the concerns raised in the July 29 letter.

The Signal group chat included a mix of local and federal officers and was used for regional drug-smuggling enforcement, according to the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office.","A Mesa County sheriff’s deputy resigned Tuesday, almost three months after he was accused of violating state law by sharing information with federal officials that led to a Utah college student’s immigration arrest, according to court records.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser on Thursday dropped the lawsuit he filed against Investigator Alexander Zwinck over the incident because of the deputy’s resignation, according to court records. Weiser agreed to dismiss the case because the law no longer applies to Zwinck after his resignation, according to a motion filed last week.

A larger investigation into whether other state law enforcement officers in the region collaborated with federal officials in a Signal group chat for the purposes of federal immigration enforcement will continue, said Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

“Because the laws he is accused of violating apply only to state and local employees, the attorney general’s office is dismissing the lawsuit against Mr. Zwinck but retaining the right to re-file the case if Mr. Zwinck becomes a state or local employee in the future,” Weiser said in a statement.

Weiser alleged in the lawsuit that Zwinck knowingly assisted in federal immigration enforcement by sharing information about 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves in the Signal group chat during a June 5 traffic stop on Interstate 70 near Loma.

Colorado law prohibits local law enforcement officers from carrying out civil immigration enforcement and largely blocks local police agencies from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The deputy purposely stalled Dias Goncalves so federal immigration officers could get into position to arrest her, and passed on details about the make and model of her car, her license plate, and her direction and timing of travel to the federal officers, knowing it would be used for immigration enforcement, Weiser said.

Zwinck pulled Dias Goncalves over because she was following a semitrailer too closely. At about 1:40 p.m., he shared a picture of her driver’s license in the Signal group chat so that federal agents could run her information through a number of databases that are only accessible to them, Weiser alleged in the lawsuit.

Zwinck questioned Dias Goncalves about her accent and where she was from — she said she was born in Brazil. He shared his location with the federal agents, who responded that they were en route. He kept Dias Goncalves for about 15 minutes, then let her go with a warning at about 1:55 p.m.

The federal agents then arrested her on immigration grounds. Dias Goncalves, who attends the University of Utah, came to the U.S. from Brazil with her family when she was 7 and overstayed a tourist visa. She has a pending asylum application, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

The Signal group chat included a mix of local and federal officers and was used for regional drug-smuggling enforcement, according to the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office.

State officials said they have not inspected the private immigrant detention center in Tacoma since last year amid legal pushback, but a recent federal court opinion could reinforce state-level oversight of health and safety conditions for detainees.

The Department of Labor & Industries reported it last inspected working conditions at the Northwest Immigration Processing Center in summer 2024 and found no violations. GEO Group, the private company operating the detention center, has challenged the state’s authority to conduct inspections and since barred entry to L&I as well as Department of Health inspectors.

“Despite hundreds of complaints and our ongoing efforts, NWIPC continues to deny entry to DOH staff,” DOH spokesperson Kara Kostanich wrote in a statement. “Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all people in Washington, including those in detention, who are among the most vulnerable in our state.”

GEO Group has contested a 2023 Washington state law that authorized new oversight of the private detention center, arguing the law unfairly discriminated against the company as the only such center in the state. Legislators amended that law earlier this year to include other facilities and impose specific penalties on health and safety violations.

The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on Aug. 19, overturning a lower court ruling that barred state officials from conducting inspections, and clarifying that the state has authority to regulate many types of civil detention facilities such as mental health institutions.

“The key issue in this case is whether the entities to which we should compare the NWIPC are state prisons or civil detention facilities,” the opinion states. “[We] conclude that the appropriate comparators are civil detention facilities.”

The case will now go back to U.S. District Court in Seattle for further proceedings.

The Department of Health had filed a separate lawsuit last year, seeking a court order to allow inspectors into the detention center to observe detainee quarters. L&I spokesman Matt Ross told Cascade PBS that the agency has maintained it has ongoing authority to conduct its workplace safety checks, but confirmed it had not inspected the center since last year.

“We already had authority under state law and the state constitution to inspect conditions for workers,” he wrote in an email, “and were already conducting routine inspections into workplace safety and health at the site.”

GEO Group recently dropped a lawsuit to block L&I from releasing records from its 2024 inspection after a Cascade PBS reporter requested those materials under the Public Records Act. The company sought an injunction against L&I in January, arguing that disclosing the inspection photos and reports to the media could undermine security at the facility. Cascade PBS was named as a defendant in the action solely in its capacity as a requestor under the Public Records Act. GEO did not seek legal or equitable relief against Cascade PBS.

In attachments to its filed complaint, GEO Group included a live hyperlink to more than 200 L&I inspection photos. Most of the photos depicted items related to workplace safety regulations such as fire extinguishers, stairways, cleaning chemical labels or personal protective equipment. Some photos included shackles, gas masks or tactical gear.

L&I later provided Cascade PBS with heavily redacted copies of those photos. Cascade PBS then asked L&I to conduct an administrative review of those redactions and officials provided a second set of similarly redacted photos, citing a security exemption raised by GEO Group.

Many redactions blacked out doorways, windows or the locations of security cameras. L&I contended the redacted photos contained “specific and unique vulnerability assessments or specific and unique emergency and escape response plans at a city, county, or state adult or juvenile correctional facility, or secure facility for persons civilly confined.”

“In this case we removed the location of security cameras, video surveillance images, and types of weapons and restraints,” an L&I records officer wrote to Cascade PBS.

GEO Group ended its case against L&I and Cascade PBS in June, filing a voluntary request for dismissal before any substantive proceedings or rulings occurred in the case.

An attorney affiliated with the Washington Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit organization advocating for government transparency, told Cascade PBS that exemptions that allow public agencies to redact information should be applied narrowly. The attorney pointed to Does v. King County, a 2015 case in which officials tried to block the release of surveillance footage of a shooting on Seattle Pacific University’s campus.

The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.

GEO Group did not respond to requests for comment on the latest federal court decision. The company is expected to file a response to the opinion by Sept. 16.

State representative Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, who sponsored both inspection bills, lauded the recent court decision, calling it an act of “justice” and a step toward holding the NWIPC accountable for its numerous alleged human rights abuses.

“We certainly should not be letting a private facility come in and profit off the backs of our most vulnerable people,” she said. “And that’s what’s been happening — with no accountability — very little from the federal government, if any, and none from the state. They’ve been able to do whatever it is that they want, but they’re doing it in our state, and I think that’s the difference.”

The panel of appellate judges held that multiple sections of the state’s inspection law did not conflict with the “intergovernmental immunity doctrine,” which protects federal agencies from state regulation or discrimination. The judges ruled that requiring DOH to adopt rules that ensure safe and sanitary conditions to people in immigration detention and enforcing civil penalties for violations of such conditions did not rise to that level.

“[T]he panel held that it would not decide at this point whether Washington regulates the conditions of confinement at the NWIPC differently from the way it regulates the conditions of confinement in other civil detention facilities,” the panel wrote. “Because the district court incorrectly concluded that the appropriate comparator was Washington’s prisons, the panel remanded to allow the district court to make the comparison with other civil detention facilities.”

The judges concluded that allowing GEO to compare its operations to prison would “ignore the critical fact that inmates in Washington’s prisons have been convicted of crimes, and that the conditions of their confinement are part of a penal regime.”

“By contrast,” the opinion states, “none of the detainees held in the NWIPC has been convicted of — or even charged with — a crime.”

Before the DOH could implement its own rules, the panel found that the already-existing contractual requirements that were implemented on the NWIPC by the state were “almost identical” to the requirements imposed under Washington law on the types of civil detention facilities.

Ortiz-Self said the decision would help Washington achieve parity with California — which, since 2017, has empowered state investigators to inspect the state’s network of immigration detention centers.

“We want it for all facilities — public or private — because we feel a sense of accountability as the state that is housing these facilities,” she said. “And in the California determination, they said, ‘Yes, as a state, states do have a right to inspect and have standards for private facilities.’”

Kostanich with DOH said the agency is still determining its next steps in the case.

“We are optimistic the federal courts will clarify DOH’s authority,” she wrote, “allowing us to conduct investigations that promote transparency and protect the health and well-being of everyone inside the facility.”

Why it matters: The offer comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has fallen far short of President Trump's ambitious deportation goals, prompting a push to hire more agents quickly.

The funding will come through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, per DHS.

Homeland Security would offer local police tools and training to enforce immigration laws while performing routine police duties.

Starting Oct. 1, ICE will fully reimburse participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer's annual salary.

Law enforcement agencies will also be eligible for quarterly monetary performance awards based on the successful location of undocumented immigrants provided by ICE.

By the numbers: As of Tuesday, state and local police from 40 states have participated, with 8,501 trained task force officers and over 2,000 officers in training, Homeland Security said.

287(g) partnerships have increased 609% under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — from 135 agreements to 958.

Zoom in: Under the agreement, police forces that locate 90% to 100% of undocumented immigrants identified by ICE will receive $1,000 per eligible task force officer.

The plan calls for sending groups of 150 attorneys, both military and civilian, with the first round expected to be identified by next week and deployed ""as soon as practicable,"" according to the memo.

Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed the move to Newsweek.

""At the request of the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges,"" Parnell said in a statement. ""These DOD attorneys will augment existing resources to help further combat a backlog of cases by presiding over immigration hearings.""

Why It Matters

The DOJ oversees the immigration court system, where judges determine whether immigrants are eligible to remain in the United States or not. The system has been facing a backlog for some time, reaching an all-time high in July as some judges left and recruitment slowed under the Trump administration.

What To Know

There are about 600 immigration judges across the country, within the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), down from a high of over 700 in the last few months of the Biden administration.

The current White House fired multiple immigration judges, some allegedly without obvious cause, despite the president's focus on immigration law and enforcement.

According to the memo seen by the AP, the deployment of Defense Department judges to the EOIR will initially last no more than 179 days.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge could have on the DOJ's backlog of cases, which stood at 3.7 million when figures were last published in June.

Last week, the EOIR issued a memo granting itself the authority to appoint any government attorney as a temporary immigration judge, stating that this would allow it to select judges from a ""larger pool of well-qualified candidates.""

The change in policy marks a shift from the current expectation that immigration judges have a decade of experience behind them before taking to the bench.

What People Are Saying

Charles Kuck, founding partner at Kuck Baxter immigration law firm in Atlanta, told Newsweek: ""Just what the Immigration Court needs—more lawyers with no experience in a wildly complicated field with defendants' lives on the line on each decision. This is not a joke. It's a travesty.

""Without a doubt, the immigration court system is broken. But this is not the way to fix it. Politicizing judges is the worst possible outcome for the immigrants in deportation proceedings.""

Lisa Koop, national director of legal services at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told Newsweek: ""While immigration court backlogs and dysfunction are not unique to this administration, the immigration judge 'shortage' is a problem of the Trump administration's own making, a result of the firing of dozens of qualified judges since January.

""Asking military attorneys with limited or no immigration experience to decipher the U.S. immigration code and administer justice is misguided; it is clearly intended to lead to speedy deportations in lieu of due process and just outcomes. In reality, this move will lead to years of tangled litigation and mishandled immigration cases. The victims will be immigrants seeking their fair day in court who are being set up to always lose, regardless of their clear eligibility for protections created by Congress and recognized by every single administration except this one.""

Sean Parnell, in his statement to Newsweek: ""The Department remains committed to continuing our support for our interagency partners, bringing the skill and dedication of America's service members and civil servants to deliver justice, restore order, and protect the American people. Beyond this, we don't have any additional details to provide at this time.""

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X: ""The Trump admin plans to double the number of immigration judges, ordering hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges, despite flimsy legal authority to do so. Notably, immigration law is infamously complex, and judges normally require months of training.""

What Happens Next

A White House official told the AP that the administration is working on a variety of options to tackle the backlog of immigration cases.

Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.","WASHINGTON — A pair of federal court rulings over the Labor Day weekend invalidated aggressive actions the Trump administration had taken on immigration enforcement.

Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ordered an unknown number of planes carrying unaccompanied Guatemalan children temporarily halted on Sunday, two days after Judge Jia Cobb struck down a policy used to bypass judicial review in quick removals of migrants far from the southern border. Both judges are of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The rulings are part of an ongoing clash between President Donald Trump and the federal judiciary over the administration’s immigration crackdown. Judges have raised concerns that immigrants’ due process rights are being violated.

On Sunday, Sooknanan voiced concern for unaccompanied children’s due process rights, and temporarily halted planes carrying the minors from taking off.

The administration had planned to deport 10 children to their home country of Guatemala.

The case resembled one earlier this year in which a judge ordered planes carrying Venezuelan men removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 grounded. Despite the order, multiple planes landed in El Salvador where more than 200 Venezuelans were sent to a notorious mega-prison.

The 10 children, nationals of Guatemala, on the planes ranged in age from 10 to 17 and crossed the southern border alone. Attorneys in court filings stressed that the children had immigration cases pending before a judge and that the children expressed fear of returning to Guatemala.

‘Everyone would be at risk’

The order followed Cobb’s order Friday granting a request from immigration rights groups to halt the implementation of a new policy that expanded expedited removal.

The administration has expanded the use of expedited removal, which allows for the quick removal of migrants, as a pillar of its aim to carry out mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.

For decades, administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, they are subject to a fast-track deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.

The Trump administration in January expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.

In Cobb’s Friday opinion, she wrote that the administration likely violated the rights of immigrants and approached a universal violation of the constitutional right to due process. Former President Joe Biden appointed Cobb in 2021.

“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” she wrote. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.”

Flights of Guatemalan minors grounded

In a flurry of action Sunday, Sooknanan temporarily halted the deportation of the children for 14 days while the case continues after an emergency request from the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

Attorneys from NILC argued that if the children were returned, they could face violence and the administration's move to deport them violated immigration procedures for unaccompanied minors.

“Defendants are imminently planning to illegally transfer Plaintiffs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement … custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests,” the attorneys wrote in their emergency filing.

The 10 children on the planes were taken off and put back into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to a status update filed Monday by NILC lawyers.

The Trump administration has identified up to 600 Guatemalan children to be removed under a pilot program created through an agreement with Guatemala, according to the court filings.

Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Biden also appointed Sooknanan.

Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, told the New York Times in an interview that the initiative began when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala in July. He added there is an agreement for Guatemala to accept more than 600 children.

DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The State Department’s 2024 report on Guatemala details human rights concerns such as violence, and advises against traveling to the country.

The case involving the unaccompanied children was reassigned to judge Timothy James Kelly, whom Trump appointed in 2017.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/prettyman.jpg?h=9ce42887&itok=cjwvBeJ6,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:27.950892

The move comes after the Justice Department last week made changes to who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge – effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration experience.

Immigration judges are the only ones who can revoke someone's green card or issue a final order of removal for people who have been in the country for more than two years and are in the process of being deported.

The military lawyers will receive some two weeks of training to serve as temporary immigration judges, according to the U.S. official.

As part of its aggressive immigration policy, the Trump administration has moved fast to increase the rate of arrests of undocumented immigration, and scale up detention space and deportations. But the rapid pace of arrests has contributed to the millions of cases backlogged at the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which houses immigration courts.

At the same time, in the last nine months, EOIR has lost over 100 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700 judges at the start of the year.

The Homeland Security Department, which oversees immigration law enforcement, has launched a nationwide recruitment campaign for deportation officers, investigators and attorneys, spurred by an influx of more funds from Congress.

President Trump earlier this year also voiced support for a plan in Florida to deputize members of the state's National Guard military lawyers, known as the Judge Advocate General's Corps, to act as immigration judges.

Earlier this year, Congress approved a mega-spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including hiring more immigration judges.

The funding and additional personnel are aimed at alleviating the growing case backlog, which is nearly 4 million cases. Hiring and training permanent judges can take more than a year.

LOS ANGELES — Mayor Karen Bass today issued the following statement in response to a federal court ruling finding that the Trump Administration’s deployment of National Guard members and Marines in Los Angeles was illegal.

“Today, the federal court ruled in favor of the people of Los Angeles,” said Mayor Karen Bass. “The White House tried to invade the second largest city in the country. That was illegal. Los Angeles will not buckle and we will not break. We will not be divided and we will not be defeated.""

Though the Trump Administration is likely to appeal, the ruling clearly states that the administration broke federal law: “Congress spoke clearly in 1878 when it passed the Posse Comitatus Act, prohibiting the use of the U.S. military to execute domestic law. Nearly 140 years later, Defendants—President Trump, Secretary of Defense Hegseth, and the Department of Defense—deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to quell a rebellion and ensure that federal immigration law was enforced. There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence. Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law. Nevertheless, at Defendants’ orders and contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws… In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.”

“The evidence at trial established that Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles,” Senior U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote in a 52-page order. “In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.”

The lead defendant in the case is Donald J. Trump.

Legal AF’s Michael Popok and I unpack the consequences of that ruling in the video above and a separate explainer below.

A “national police force”

In early June, Trump ordered the California National Guard to respond to immigration-related protests in Los Angeles, first with a force of nearly 5,000 troops, a number larger than the total deployed to Afghanistan in the first three months after Sept. 11, 2001.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) quickly sued over the deployment, and the resulting case of Newsom v. Trump has been determining what legal limits will exist, if any, over the use of the military on civilian streets in the United States.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta described the ruling as an affirmation that “President Trump is not King, and the power of the executive is not boundless.”

“For more than two months, the President has engaged in political theater, using National Guard troops and Marines as pawns to further his anti-immigrant agenda,” Bonta wrote in a statement. “In doing so, he trampled on one of the very basic foundations of our democracy: That our military be apolitical and the activities of troops on U.S. soil be extremely limited to ensure civil liberties and protect against military overreach.”

In the wake of the litigation, the Pentagon has withdrawn all but 300 troops, and this order does not force the remainder to leave. Instead, Judge Breyer’s narrow ruling orders the remainder to follow the nearly 150-year-old law.

“The injunction applies only to Defendants’ use of the National Guard in California, not nationally,” Breyer wrote. “Defendants are not required to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops currently stationed in Los Angeles, nor are they barred from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act.”

Despite the limited scope, Breyer acknowledged that Trump’s designs are far larger.

“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country—including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California—thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” the ruling states.

The Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit tied Breyer’s hands from offering more sweeping relief. With limited exceptions, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Trump v. CASA all but abolished nationwide injunctions earlier this year. The Ninth Circuit found Trump likely had the power to issue his order to deploy the troops, subject to the constraints of the Posse Comitatus Act.

“All the way from the top”

During a three-day trial earlier this summer, Trump’s Justice Department floated a novel legal theory supposedly allowing the military to engage in crowd control, traffic control, riot control and security patrols on civilian streets: a so-called “constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, which the judge rejected.

“In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months—and counting,” the ruling said. “The instructions to train Task Force 51 on the purported constitutional exception and thereby excuse unlawful military conduct came ‘all the way from the top’ of the Department of Defense.”

Judge Breyer had been quoting the testimony of Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, the top commander of Task Force 51, behind the Los Angeles troop deployment.

Trial evidence showed that the task force knew that the Posse Comitatus Act prohibited these uses of the military, but the bullet points in red text were supposedly “constitutional exceptions” dictated from above the general.

“That instruction was incorrect,” Breyer wrote. “There is no exception to the Posse Comitatus Act for such conduct, and neither President Trump’s June 7 memorandum nor Secretary Hegseth’s June 23 memorandum changed that.”

The judge paused his ruling until Sept. 12 to make way for an inevitable appeal.

Although Trump routinely discusses using the military for civilian law enforcement, his Justice Department did not even claim the power to do so in court. Their legal defenses at trial involved denying Posse Comitatus Act violations and arguing that it could not be enforced through a civil injunction. If the ruling stands, it could serve as a blueprint for similar rulings across the country for other cities that Trump has placed in his crosshairs.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VxrT!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F172583175%2Fca5f680a-f6a0-4de8-a6b3-81a617b69ae5%2Ftranscoded-1756830728.png",N,,2025-09-02 18:57:02.636860

“It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”","McALLEN, Texas (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration’s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo is among several steps the Trump administration has taken involving children who came to the U.S. alone. Over the Labor Day weekend it attempted to remove Guatemalan children who were living in shelters or with foster care families.

The July 9 memo regarding sponsors said they must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says “federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.”

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

WATCH: Court blocks deportation flights of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don’t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates “clearly and proactively” with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won’t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden’s administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden’s administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don’t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

“If we don’t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?” said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among the steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

“The agency’s mission has been conflated and entangled,” she added. “It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-01T165108Z_1065688202_RC23JGADLTHU_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-GUATEMALA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 15:57:06.432554

What GAO Found

Between 2019 and 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—experienced a significant increase in the number of individuals apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol along the southwest border. To address this issue, CBP used temporary soft-sided facilities—steel-framed tent-like structures—to provide additional capacity for processing and holding people in its custody.

Because they are temporary, the number of facilities can change due to trends in the number of people apprehended. In September 2024, CBP had seven soft-sided facilities with different capacities—from 983 to 2,500. In March 2025, CBP ceased operating these facilities due to a significant drop in apprehensions.

Aerial and Interior Views of Soft-Sided Facilities Used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection

CBP obligated over $4 billion total from 2019 through 2024 for soft-sided facilities and related services. But CBP engaged in limited acquisition planning to inform its investments in these facilities. For example, CBP did not take steps to accurately determine the number of contractor staff it needed to operate those facilities. As a result, some locations had either too few or too many staff. While CBP is not currently operating soft-sides facilities, it is likely to do so in the future if there are future surges in apprehensions, according to officials. Thus, CBP has an opportunity to identify and document lessons learned to better inform future investment decisions for these facilities.

In fiscal year 2022, Congress appropriated $330 million to DHS to develop and construct Joint Processing Centers. DHS plans to build and operate up to five of these facilities along the southwest border, which GAO estimates could cost roughly $7 billion. While DHS engaged in some initial planning to acquire Joint Processing Centers, officials did not complete key acquisition planning and oversight steps that leading practices suggest are key to inform large-dollar investments. For example, DHS began construction on the Laredo, Texas Joint Processing Center in October 2024 without reliable and complete operations and cost information. Further, it has not fully documented requirements and criteria for determining its Joint Processing Center locations. Documenting its process for identifying future Joint Processing Center locations and completing a life-cycle cost estimate would ensure that DHS is managing billions of dollars of mission critical services efficiently and effectively.

Why GAO Did This Study

CBP relied on contracts to operate and maintain soft-sided facilities (SSF). These facilities provide support and services when additional processing and holding capacity is needed for individuals apprehended along the southwest border. DHS also received funding to construct Joint Processing Centers (JPC)—permanent facilities that DHS expects will be more cost-effective than SSFs in the future.

GAO was asked to review CBP's and DHS's use and oversight of SSFs and JPCs. This report examines, among other things, (1) how CBP used contracts to support its SSF needs, and (2) the extent to which CBP and DHS engaged in planning efforts for SSF and JPC related acquisitions.

GAO analyzed contracting data on SSF contract obligations for fiscal years 2019-2024, and reviewed DHS budget plans, acquisition policies, and cost estimates for SSFs and JPCs. GAO also visited four selected SSF locations in Yuma and Tucson, AZ, El Paso, TX, and San Diego, CA based in part on apprehension and cost data; reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of eight of 69 contracts for SSFs and JPC construction contract documents; and interviewed DHS and CBP officials.",https://www.gao.gov/assets/extracts/e94ce2448bb9f2574dc201ee4e10de8b/rId17_image5.png,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:36.184169

The lawsuit follows the recent introduction of LRB 4042, a bill by Wisconsin State Representative Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee), which seeks to achieve similar protections through legislation. However, with Republicans controlling the state legislature, the bill has little chance of advancing.

“Wisconsinites deserve to know who is policing their communities,” said Kirk Bangstad, founder of the Minocqua Brewing Company. “When ICE agents hide their identities, it creates an environment ripe for abuse—both by ICE officers themselves and by impersonators who use the cover of anonymity to assault, rob, and terrorize women.”

For months, the Super PAC urged Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul to bring this lawsuit, providing both legal arguments and a draft of the complaint. After Kaul declined to act, the organization filed suit directly.

“This is the Attorney General’s job, not ours,” Bangstad continued. “But when elected officials refuse to protect Wisconsinites, we have no choice but to step in. ICE’s current practices violate the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution, and it’s time the courts hold them accountable.”

Bangstad warned that without oversight, ICE’s unchecked actions could extend beyond harassment of citizens and immigrants.

“If ICE agents are allowed to intimidate without accountability today, they’ll be doing the same to voters tomorrow,” Bangstad said. “We must act now to protect both our communities and our democracy.”

To be blunt, Trump’s interference with ongoing disaster recovery and relief efforts is dangerous.","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown efforts have begun interfering directly with frontline responders of recent disasters – raising substantial fears about what could happen when more serious disasters strike.

On August 27, the Seattle Times reported that two firefighter crews deployed to fight the Bear Gulch fire on the Olympic Peninsula were held by Border Patrol agents, and two firefighters were eventually arrested after being accused of living in the country illegally. As the Times reported in what must be the most incredible understatement of the year, “It is unusual for federal border agents to make arrests during the fighting of an active fire, especially in a remote area.” The move is baffling, as it is pretty well known that nationwide, recruiting and retaining wildland firefighters has been an ongoing challenge. This issue, highlighted by the Government Accountability Office, stems from factors such as low wages, poor work/life balance, mental health challenges, and a lack of workforce diversity. The situation is so dire that California uses incarcerated labor. The recent arrests are likely to exacerbate the problem significantly. The administration is now prioritizing statistics, like the number of undocumented immigrants caught in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) sweeps, over the country’s ability to combat destructive fires. And doing that in the middle of an active fire is deadly for everyone involved.

The White House is taking other steps that clearly prioritizing immigration detention over disaster relief. The Washington Post reported on the same day of the ICE raid in Washington state that new Department of Homeland Security contracts for aid organizations responding to disasters require these organizations to act as agents of ICE. The latest Fiscal Year 2025 DHS Standard Terms and Conditions for grants, cooperative agreements, fixed-amount awards, and financial assistance now includes a “Communication and Cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration Officials” section. Within that section, recipients are required to share information, assist in immigration operations (including temporarily detaining people), provide access to information on disaster survivors, and maintain confidentiality around ICE operations. To be clear, this means that if an organization such as the Red Cross receives federal funding to set up a temporary shelter for evacuees, they are required to identify undocumented immigrants, detain them, and let ICE know.

There are so many logistical and ethical issues with this that it’s hard to know even where to start. Aid organizations are not equipped to meet these requirements, particularly for detaining someone. Their core mission revolves around saving lives, not enforcing immigration law. Aid organizations, many of which are faith-based, have expressed concerns that the requirements “violate First Amendment freedoms, undermine religious neutrality, and force institutions to betray core values.” Another problem is that these requirements will deter survivors from seeking aid or services from any organization that receives DHS funding. This can be a death sentence for survivors of a disaster.

These are just two examples out of many in which the administration’s decisions at FEMA are creating a scenario in which all the worst possible things can and will go wrong simultaneously. It is a fear that is not going unnoticed inside the government. Last week, 182 current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees addressed a letter to Trump’s FEMA Review Council and Congress stating recent decisions at the agency were putting the US at risk of another Hurricane Katrina-level disaster. Not surprisingly, the next day, about two dozen employees who had signed the letter were placed on leave. This reflects a pattern within the administration of replacing experienced and knowledgeable personnel who may disagree with policies with individuals who prioritize praising the president during meetings.

To be blunt, Trump’s interference with ongoing disaster recovery and relief efforts is dangerous. And as this pattern of politically motivated interference continues, the nation faces an escalating risk of failures in disaster response and an erosion of trust in the institutions that are supposed to keep people safe. With disasters increasing every year, lives are hanging in the balance. The US can’t afford political theater over doing what’s best for communities.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETH_Trump_Immagration_Policy.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:07.083331

The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department “as soon as practicable” and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the memo, dated Aug. 27.

The effort comes as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration across the country, ramping up arrests and deportations. Immigration courts also already are dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years.

When asked about the move, a DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department. Pentagon officials directed questions to the White House.

A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official said the matter should be “a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”

What Happens Next The White House is encouraging more departments to sign up for the 287(g) program.","The Department of Homeland Security launched a new program on Tuesday to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies that assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in targeting the ""worst of the worst"" criminal unauthorized immigrants.

The payments, set to begin on October 1, 2025, will be made to local law enforcement officers and departments that participate in the 287(g) program, which enables them to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.

Why It Matters

The Trump administration has sought to expand its immigration enforcement operations through partnerships with local police and sheriff's departments, as well as state troopers, arguing that they are often best placed to seek out alleged illegal immigrants in their communities.

Critics have warned that the moves break down trust between the police and immigrant communities, while some within law enforcement have cautioned against turning officers away from investigating crimes in favor of doing what has often been seen as the federal government's job.

What To Know

Starting October 1, participating agencies will receive full coverage for the salary and benefits of trained 287(g) officers, including up to 25 percent in overtime. Law enforcement agencies will also be eligible for quarterly performance bonuses ranging from $500 to $1,000 per officer, based on effectiveness.

If an officer has a 90-100 percent success rate in locating alleged illegal immigrants, a department could receive $1,000. An 80-89 percent success rate would result in a $750 payment, while a 70-79 percent success rate would qualify for a $500 payment per officer.

What Is the 287(g) Program?

The 287(g) program enables state and local law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE to assist in identifying and detaining individuals suspected of being in the country illegally.

The expansion of 287(g) partnerships, funded by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, has surged 609 percent, jumping from 135 to nearly 960 agreements across 40 states. DHS and ICE officials urged more agencies to join the program, framing it as a national effort to enhance public safety.

The DHS said on Tuesday that over 8,501 officers have been trained under the program, with more than 2,000 currently in training to carry out immigration enforcement.

What Is the Immigration and Nationality Act?

The 287(g) program's name originates from the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that grants it authority.

The legislation has governed U.S. immigration policy for decades, first enacted in the 1950s and largely unchanged since. It covers how the federal government regulates immigration levels and grants what are known as immigration benefits, including visas, green cards, and citizenship.

Multiple attempts have been made by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress over the following decades to update policies, sometimes through amendments to the INA. Others have looked to pass more sweeping changes, which would effectively replace the act.

What People Are Saying

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Newsweek: ""This is an unprecedented use of ICE resources, but it comes from Congress's unprecedented appropriations for ICE in the recent budget reconciliation bill.

""In the past, ICE has compensated 287(g) counties for some costs related to detention, under a separate program, not compensation for the 287(g) officers' time or other costs.

""This policy incentivizes taking state and local police off the streets and protecting communities from violent crimes and victimization. It is a dangerous diversion of state and local resources.""

ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, in a press release: ""ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country. Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE launched a new reimbursement program for state and local law enforcement who partner with DHS to make America safe again.""

What Happens Next

The White House is encouraging more departments to sign up for the 287(g) program.

Federal immigration officials are making arrests from within Tennessee jails at a much higher rate than other states. A new report ranks Tennessee second only to Texas in the number of people ICE picks up from jail.

The data suggests more ICE agents in the state are relying on local police to carry out President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations.

The report, published by the Prison Policy Initiative, put Tennessee in the top five for ICE arrests per capita. That ranking is much higher for arrests that happen inside jails.

“What the data suggests is happening in Tennessee overall is that police are arresting people, either explicitly so that ICE can pick them up, or for other offenses … and then holding them until ICE comes and takes them away,” PPI spokesperson Wanda Bertram said.

Those kinds of arrests have been especially high in Knox County, where the number of people held for ICE jumped from 6 in January to nearly 50 in April.

Bertram said that non-citizens are more likely to face jail time for minor offenses, like driving without a license.

“There are a number of ways that immigrants can be sucked into the jail system for things that I’m sure the Trump administration would like to paint as serious crimes, but are actually very minor offenses,” Bertram said.

ICE did not respond to WPLN’s requests for comment, but in a visit to Nashville in July, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem promised more federal agents would be coming to Tennessee, and to Nashville specifically.

Pritzker confirmed federal immigration agents will be coming to Chicago soon, citing a phone call he received from the federal government.
In an exclusive interview with NBC Chicago, Pritzker said after weeks of hearing no communication from the Trump administration, his team received a phone call, but not from the president himself.
""We don't know if the National Guard is coming or not coming.
Pritzker noted that Trump could also call the National Guard from another state, where the governor might be more sympathetic to his cause.
I'm going to have to call in National Guard,'"" Pritzker said.","Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker confirmed federal immigration agents will be coming to Chicago soon, citing a phone call he received from the federal government.

In an exclusive interview with NBC Chicago, Pritzker said after weeks of hearing no communication from the Trump administration, his team received a phone call, but not from the president himself. The phone call, made to Illinois State Police, came from Gregory Bovino, the border patrol sector chief for the El Centro, Texas sector. Bovino oversaw the immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles earlier this summer.

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker told NBC Chicago's Mary Ann Ahern. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

""Did they give you a number?"" Ahern asked.

""They did not,"" Pritzker said.

A report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

That appears to be separate from President Donald Trump's repeated threats to send in National Guard troops to help solve what he says is Chicago's crime problem. Questions remain about whether troops will come to Illinois, even to the state's leader.

""We don't know if the National Guard is coming or not coming. We know ICE is coming. And ICE has the responsibility to enforce immigration laws. They shouldn't do it the way they were doing it in Los Angeles. But they have that responsibility, and they should do it in the proper way, not the way Tom Homan is having them do it, or Kristi Noem,"" Pritzker said.

Trump made comments about Chicago on his social media platform Truth Social twice Tuesday morning. First, he cited the high crime numbers in the city over Labor Day weekend, writing: ""Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far. Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon.""

The president then wrote, ""CHICAGO IS THE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!""

Pritzker rebuked the president's claims.

""Donald Trump obviously has Chicago on his mind seemingly every day now. And they are clearly going to send ICE officials and officers to the neighborhoods,"" Pritzker said. ""I hope that they if they come here, that they will not act as they did in Los Angeles, which is provocative. But unfortunately, the guy who is leading that effort here in Chicago is the same one that led the effort in Los Angeles. So, I'm not optimistic.""

Pritzker was hoping to travel to Japan for a trade mission at the end of the week, but with the threat of ICE agents and potentially the National Guard coming to Chicago, he said he may have to postpone the trip.

""You've been already told that?"" Ahern asked.

""Yes,"" Pritzker confirmed.

Pritzker said crime has gone down in Chicago, and if the president wants to bring them down further, he can stop defunding crime prevention, and also help the state hire more FBI and ATF agents.

""Can the National Guard in Illinois be called when you haven't called them?"" Ahern asked Pritzker.

""They can be. They can be federalized, but the purposes only can be, according to the law, for them to be sent overseas to protect us, which our National Guard does all the time, or if there's an emergency. Truly an emergency on the ground, an insurrection on the ground,"" he said.

Pritzker noted that Trump could also call the National Guard from another state, where the governor might be more sympathetic to his cause. However, Pritzker said, that would also be illegal, and the court system seems to be in agreement with Pritzker's assessment. On Tuesday morning, a federal judge said Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal.

Posse Comitatus is an act that was passed in the 1878 that, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, bars federal troops from participating in civilian law enforcement except when expressly authorized by law.

""The president is ignoring that law, and then he's making up reasons why it's OK that he could send troops. So, I'm very deeply concerned that he's going to have ICE come here and cause the same mayhem that they caused in Los Angeles so that he can say, 'Oh, look, there's mayhem on the ground. I'm going to have to call in National Guard,'"" Pritzker said.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-11.42.38 AM.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-02 14:58:02.407630

NewsNation previously reported that more than 13,000 migrant children who arrived at the southern border without supervision have been located, an HHS spokesperson confirmed.
The agency defers to DHS on any immigration enforcement actions that take place during those interviews.
In addition, HHS said that children in custody of ORR have access to legal counsel and that while in ORR, children can reach out to their attorney of record at any time.","(NewsNation) — The Office of Refugee Resettlement has changed its policy on how sponsors or family members for children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied by an adult guardian or parent verify their identification, which some groups fear places them at risk with federal immigration enforcement officers and agents.

Until recently, family members and sponsors were permitted to provide identification electronically. But under the policy change, those adults must now show up in person for interviews, where they could be interviewed by immigration enforcement officers, The Associated Press reported.

An ORR spokesperson told NewsNation on Tuesday that agency staff members require that sponsors provide a valid ID in person at the time of a child being released into their custody.

The office, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, is responsible for taking custody of children who enter the United States without a parent or guardian. NewsNation previously reported that more than 13,000 migrant children who arrived at the southern border without supervision have been located, an HHS spokesperson confirmed.

Under the Biden administration, 320,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General has previously said. In March, a report issued by the office said that ICE has been unable to effectively monitor more than 600,000 unaccompanied children who crossed the southern border since 2019.

While the Office of Refugee Resettlement is not a law enforcement or immigration enforcement agency, it is directed by the Homeland Security Act of 2022 to provide care for these children and placement with a fully vetted family member or sponsor.

The HHS spokesperson said that as part of the communication process between the office and sponsors, sponsors are “clearly and proactively” informed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations or other law enforcement may be present at the time that the identification verification takes place.

The policy does not require sponsors to participate in HSI interviews as a condition of release for the child. The spokesperson said that this dismisses the notion that declining to be interviewed has a bearing on whether that person can sponsor a child. The agency defers to DHS on any immigration enforcement actions that take place during those interviews.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the purported sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” the ORR spokesperson said in a statement provided to NewsNation.

A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a NewsNation request for comment on Tuesday.

In addition, HHS said that children in custody of ORR have access to legal counsel and that while in ORR, children can reach out to their attorney of record at any time.

However, these allowances for children in ORR custody do not calm the fears of immigration rights groups, which believe that the family members or sponsors could be walking into a “built-in opportunity” to be arrested by federal immigration enforcement, Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, told the AP.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

As of last October, more than 43,000 unaccompanied children who were served with court orders did not show up for scheduled court dates. In addition, 31,000 of those who were released to sponsors had release forms that did not include addresses, had missing apartment numbers or were undeliverable, the inspector general’s office said in its report.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/03/unaccompanied_minors_border_immigration_03132021_AP22011017341029.png?w=1280,N,,2025-09-02 14:57:47.961247

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco did not require the several hundred remaining troops to be withdrawn and set his order to go into effect Sept. 12.

The order comes after California sued, saying the troops sent to Los Angeles over the summer were violating a law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws. Lawyers for Trump’s Republican administration have argued the Posse Comitatus Act doesn’t apply because the troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws. They say the troops were mobilized under an authority that allows the president to deploy them.

The judge’s decision comes as Trump has discussed National Guard deployments in Democratic-led cities like Chicago, Baltimore and New York. He has already deployed the guard as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, where he has direct legal control.

Trump federalized members of the California National Guard and sent them to the second-largest U.S. city over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and city leaders. Trump did so under a law that allows the president to call the guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”

Trump has pushed the bounds of typical military activity on domestic soil, including through the creation of militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Newsom posted on X, in an all-caps reflection of the president’s own social media style, “DONALD TRUMP LOSES AGAIN. The courts agree — his militarization of our streets and use of the military against US citizens is ILLEGAL.”

The White House and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Breyer’s scathing ruling accused the Trump administration of “willfully” violating the law, saying it used troops for functions that were barred by their own training materials, refused to “meaningfully coordinate with state and local officials” and “‘coached'” federal law enforcement agencies on the language to use when requesting assistance.

“These actions demonstrate that Defendants knew that they were ordering troops to execute domestic law beyond their usual authority,” he wrote. “The evidence at trial established that Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles.”

Roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were deployed to Los Angeles in early June to deal with protests, over the objections of state and local officials. All were pulled back by the end of July except about 250 National Guard troops. The judge noted that the remaining troops got improper training on what they can and cannot do under the law.

Breyer also noted the Trump administration’s possible plans to call National Guard troops into other U.S. cities.

In Los Angeles, National Guard members joined an operation at MacArthur Park in downtown Los Angeles intended as a show of force against people in the U.S. illegally and those protesting the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They also accompanied federal immigration officers on raids at two state-licensed marijuana nurseries in Ventura County, Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman testified.

Sherman, who initially commanded the troops deployed to Los Angeles, testified during the second day of the trial that he raised concerns the deployment could violate the Posse Comitatus Act.

He said soldiers were trained on the law and given materials that included a list of activities prohibited by the act, including doing security patrols and conducting traffic control, crowd control and riot control.

Sherman said that while the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits troops from carrying out those actions, he was told by his superiors that there was a “constitutional exception” that permitted such activities when the troops are protecting federal property or personnel.",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Newsom-Trump.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1,N,,2025-09-02 15:57:10.642325

The new phenomenon, referred to as ""reverse flow"" migration, has mainly impacted migrants fleeing the economic and political turmoil in Venezuela and who had been moving north through Central America toward the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the political crisis in Venezuela.

The report, published by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had plummeted by 97% this year.

TRUMP'S DHS TOUTS MASSIVE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DEPORTED AS DEMS LASH OUT AT ICE

""It’s time to go back — the American dream wasn’t like this,"" one migrant said, per the report.

The report links the reversal to President Donald Trump's border policies, with 46% of migrants citing policy changes and 49% saying they could not enter the U.S. Another 34% ran out of resources and 17% feared detention or deportation.

Migration through the treacherous Darién Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed.

The report also blames U.S. financial reductions for drying up humanitarian aid. As a result, NGOs and U.N. agencies that were filling protection gaps in places like the Darién Gap and along return routes had to shut down or scale back operations.

Additionally, tougher transit restrictions in Panama mean the traditional pipeline toward the U.S. is nearly shut.

That flow slowed somewhat in 2024 but dried up almost completely early this year as President Trump fulfilled his campaign promise of shutting the border.

Southwest border apprehensions hit a monthly record low in July, with only 4,399 apprehensions, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. For the third month in a row, there were zero releases. This is the new all-time record low, beating the prior record low of 6,070 in June.

Biden repeatedly had single days when apprehensions ranged from 8,000 to 10,000 migrants, with his highest single month being December 2023, when 249,785 Border Patrol apprehensions were recorded.

The migrants who had hoped to reach the U.S. now find themselves in a difficult situation and some face violence, abuse and exploitation, the report states.

Roughly 50% of those interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia said they intended to go back to Venezuela, with around a quarter of those interviewed planning to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Some migrants will continue moving south within Latin America, but the report warns they face unsafe boat journeys, dependence on smugglers and criminal groups that prey on returnees. Others remain stranded in places like Palenque, Miramar, Necoclí, Bahía Solano and Medellín, sleeping in parks or abandoned buildings without access to food, shelter or medical care.

Humanitarian monitors said many are turning to survival strategies such as informal work, begging or even transactional sex.

""We don’t know whether to stay in Colombia or go to Chile. I worry a lot about my children; they’re tired of moving so much,"" one migrant said.

Scott Campbell, the U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said the returnees are among the most vulnerable people on the continent and urged governments not to abandon the migrants.

""Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Campbell said. ""We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/migrants-turn-back.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 13:56:44.002702

Sharereh Moghadam was taken into custody after attending an in-person immigration meeting, which she thought was a step closer to citizenship, according to Aghdassi. Instead, she was transferred to a detention center in Phoenix.

“She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,” said Aghdassi. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.”

Aghdassi says Sharareh was born in Iran and entered the country legally with her documents in order. He believes a recent trip to Iran is the reason behind her detention.

ICE has since rejected Aghdassi’s claims that Moghaddam had no criminal history.

“Reports that Sharareh Moghaddam has no criminal history are completely FALSE and are only being used to try garner support for a thief. Sharareh Moghaddam is neither a citizen nor a national of the United States. She is an Iranian native and citizen with a documented criminal history dating back to 2015. Moghaddam entered the United States at an unknown time and location in 2014 and obtained lawful status in 2016. Despite being granted the opportunity to remain in the country, between August 2015 and May 9, 2019, Moghaddam was convicted of two separate theft offenses, demonstrating a clear disregard for U.S. laws and rendering her subject to removal under U.S. immigration law,” wrote an ICE spokesperson in a statement to NBC4.

The Iranian couple runs a balloon shop along Laurel Canyon, which has gained the community’s support over the last few weeks. Customers have begun signing a petition requesting that lawmakers step in before Moghadam’s next hearing.

In the meantime, Aghdassi says he is clinging to hope that one day he will be reunited with his wife.

“Years ago, for us, the dream was the U.S. is a land of opportunity and freedom, and it was, but right now you can see everything changed. You don’t feel secure anymore,” said Aghdassi.

The recent immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California are part of President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to carry out a mass deportation plan.

Through Aug. 31, nearly 60,930 migrants had been taken into ICE detention since the start of Trump’s second term, according to NBC News, which used ICE data both public and internal as well as data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. About 29% of those in detention had criminal convictions; 25.6% had pending criminal charges; 45% were listed as “other immigration violator;” and 11.6% were fast-tracked for deportation.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250902-Sharereh-Moghadam-Hooshang-Aghdassi-se-1158a-5db1c4.jpg",N,,2025-09-02 13:56:47.987775

The climate of uncertainty, Cepero López noted, is compounded by Florida’s broader restrictions on curriculum and diversity initiatives.
As Miami’s public research university, FIU has long recruited students and faculty from across Latin America and the Caribbean.
For FIU faculty, it’s a breach of the university’s own stated mission of openness and inclusion, and highlights the stakes of the university’s entanglement in immigration enforcement.","Florida International University (FIU) is under fire from one of its own faculty members after news reports detailed that the school provided equipment to the Everglades immigration detention facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The disclosure intensified existing anger over FIU’s police partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and ongoing labor disputes, fueling demands for transparency, higher pay, and accountability from administrators.

After Prism and NBC6 reported that FIU supplied an emergency operations trailer to the construction site at “Alligator Alcatraz,” university President Jeanette Nuñez confirmed in a recent NBC6 interview that the university did so at the state’s request, clarifying that the equipment is owned by the state’s Department of Emergency Management, the lead agency overseeing construction and operations of the facility.

“It is a state asset, let’s be clear,” Nuñez told anchor Jackie Nespral. “When the Department of Emergency Management requests a state asset, we have to provide it. We don’t opine, we don’t object. People want to make more out of it than what it was.”

The president was not asked about the implications for the workers who had to carry out the task. Those workers expressed concern when given the order, according to an FIU staff member who previously spoke to Prism on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. FIU has not responded to Prism’s request for comment.

Faculty leaders say Nuñez’s explanation does little to ease concerns that the university—long touted as a haven for immigrant students—is complicit in immigration enforcement.

“FIUPD is ICE,” said Tania Cepero López, the president of the United Faculty of Florida (UFF-FIU) union, referring to the FIU Police Department. “The faculty are amazing, the students are wonderful, smart, and dedicated, and they deserve the best education in the world.”

FIU and ICE relationship deepens fears on campus

The equipment controversy comes on top of outrage over FIU’s finalized 287(g) agreement, which deputizes campus police as ICE agents. Nuñez defended the decision in the NBC6 interview, arguing that the agreement gives FIU more control.

“If ICE wants to come on campus, regardless of the agreement, they will come,” she said. “So they do have access to come into our campus. The police chief took the position, and I supported him, that he wanted to be in control [of] the situation from the get-go.”

Faculty remain unconvinced. Internal emails obtained by Prism show that the faculty union began pressing the administration in June for guidance on how faculty should respond if ICE enters classrooms in the coming school year. Only on Aug. 22 did the university provide a formal response: ICE can access public areas and enter classrooms with a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances, and faculty should not obstruct ICE and notify FIUPD. The memo confirmed that FIUPD officers will inform faculty when acting as ICE agents, but stated that the university has “no plans to provide notifications” of ICE operations.

“The main priority right now is compliance, so that there’s no retaliation, so that we don’t lose funding, so that we don’t lose any more grants, so that we don’t lose courses in the curriculum,” Cepero López said of her impression of FIU administration’s motives. “There’s a lot of interference and a lot of oversight happening that, to me, is unprecedented.”

Cepero López added that the partnership with ICE is chilling both teaching and learning on campus. Faculty members, she said, are increasingly worried that under the new agreement, their syllabi, reading lists, and classroom discussions could become targets of political or police scrutiny.

The sense of fear is especially acute among international and undocumented students, according to Cepero López, many of whom have asked whether their classroom attendance could put them at risk if ICE officers entered a lecture hall or classroom. She said professors have reported receiving anxious questions from students regarding protocol around ICE and FIU police. Teachers themselves have been asking what they should do if an agent arrives during class and whether to continue teaching, ask for a warrant, or protect their students. Some students even fear returning to campus due to their immigration status, Cepero López said? .

The climate of uncertainty, Cepero López noted, is compounded by Florida’s broader restrictions on curriculum and diversity initiatives.

“Faculty are wondering, what’s the next thing that we’re going to be forced to do? What’s the next compliance item that we’re going to be forced to spend two hours working on instead of working on our research, instead of working on our lesson plans, instead of working on replying to student emails?” she said. “The morale is as low as I’ve ever seen it.”

Faculty say FIU’s collaboration with ICE undermines the very values that have defined the institution since its founding: diversity, inclusion, and international engagement. As Miami’s public research university, FIU has long recruited students and faculty from across Latin America and the Caribbean. Now, professors warn that that reputation is at risk.

Town hall invitation denied

In an attempt to provide a space for administration to answer the community’s concerns, on Aug. 18, UFF-FIU formally invited FIU’s top leadership, including Núñez, Police Chief Alexander Casas, Provost Elizabeth Béjar, Board of Trustees Chair Carlos Duart, and General Counsel Ryan Kelley, to attend a community town hall. The union asked them to choose from three dates in September to discuss the ICE agreement, Duart’s business contracts tied to the detention camp, and FIU’s provision of state-owned assets.

“Our faculty, students, and community deserve a clear explanation of these institutional actions that affect our learning spaces and safety,” the union wrote in a letter.

Four days later, the administration declined. In a letter sent by Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs Barbara Manzano, the chief negotiator in ongoing contract negotiations between the university and the union, FIU leaders said attendance was “unnecessary.” Instead, they pointed to prior appearances at a Faculty Senate meeting in April, a town hall in May, and Núñez’s TV interviews.

“Please feel free to use this response at the forum, in lieu of our attendance,” Manzano wrote.

Faculty say the event, scheduled for Sept. 9, will proceed without FIU leadership.

“I told them we’re going to do the town hall with or without you,” Cepero López said.

Bargaining battle adds to tensions

The disputes over ICE and FIU’s relationship are unfolding alongside contentious contract negotiations. Some faculty members say that FIU has refused to honor raises previously negotiated in a three-year contract, citing legislative funding shortfalls. Instead, administrators have offered one-time bonuses tied to performance evaluations, a substitute that faculty call both inadequate and demoralizing.

“We’re at that point where we are tired of being asked to do more with less, and we’re just not going to continue to do that anymore,” Cepero López said. “Good working conditions for faculty equal good working conditions for students equal good learning conditions for students.”

The rejected raises would have provided a 2% increase across the board and an additional 1.5% merit raise. The raises wouldn’t have kept pace with inflation and Miami’s skyrocketing housing market, Cepero López said, but they were still seen as a baseline commitment.

“FIU has a strong tradition of faculty and administration collaborating, and that’s what made FIU rise so quickly,” Cepero López said. “And for so long, we’ve done a lot with a lot less than other universities.”

Instead, FIU proposed bonuses as low as $1,500 for faculty whose performance reviews were “satisfactory” and $3,000 for those rated “outstanding.” Unlike raises, bonuses do not contribute to base pay, meaning that salaries remain stagnant year to year.

During the most recent bargaining session on Aug. 29, the administration presented a new counteroffer: a recurring raise of 1% to base salary or $1,000 (whichever is greater) for nine-month faculty, with the equivalent applied to 12-month faculty, alongside a tiered one-time merit bonus of $1,000 to $2,000 based on performance evaluations. To fund the recurring increase, FIU said it shifted $2.2 million in expenses for postdoctoral hires from recurring to nonrecurring dollars.

Faculty union leaders acknowledged the adjustment but noted that FIU remains the only preeminent public university in Florida that initially offered no recurring salary increase this year. Other universities, including the University of West Florida, which offered 4% merit-based raises for the second year in a row, have made more competitive offers. The union will reconvene with administrators in the coming week ahead of a ratification vote on Sept. 16 and 17.

The issue cuts to the heart of recruitment and retention. Faculty warn that without competitive salaries, FIU risks losing talent to other universities including those outside the state. Several faculty members noted that the administration has simultaneously expanded spending on compliance measures and visiting instructors? to cover ballooning freshman classes, while telling full-time faculty that there isn’t enough recurring money to honor their contracts.

Litigation looms over “Alligator Alcatraz”

While FIU faces growing unrest on campus, the detention center itself is under legal fire. On Aug. 21, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a preliminary injunction halting construction, barring the admission of new detainees, and requiring operations to wind down within 60 days.

The lawsuit, brought by Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, argues that the facility violated the National Environmental Policy Act by proceeding without an environmental impact study. Litigation will continue even as the camp closes.

“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said in a press release. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government—and there are consequences for ignoring them.”

For the Miccosukee, whose homes and sacred grounds sit nearby, it was also a violation of sovereignty.

“Justice for us is people’s sovereign rights being respected on all levels,” said William “Popeye” Osceola, the secretary of the Miccosukee Tribe. “It reminds us that as much as the system is geared against us, there are still mechanisms we can engage with to fight for what we know is right, including our rights to this land. But it’s also a sovereignty issue.”

Osceola said the state and federal governments circumvented processes that the tribe has worked decades, if not centuries, to help establish. Those processes, he said, don’t just protect and benefit the tribe, but also other fellow citizens, including all Floridians, South Floridians, and any Americans visiting Big Cypress or the Everglades.

“Those who want this to happen are betting on people getting complaisant,” he said. “It’s no time to be complaisant.”

The university’s handling of these controversies mirrors a broader pattern critics say has defined the detention camp itself: decisions imposed from above without meaningful input from those most affected. For Miccosukee tribal members, who were excluded from consultation as construction encroached on their ancestral lands, that exclusion was a violation of sovereignty. For FIU faculty, it’s a breach of the university’s own stated mission of openness and inclusion, and highlights the stakes of the university’s entanglement in immigration enforcement.

“I don’t understand why they can’t communicate to us why this is happening and we have to hear from Jackie Nespral interviewing our president,” Cepero López said. “That’s not what accountability looks like.”

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the military from performing civilian law enforcement duties. In a 52-page opinion, he also ruled that the administration exceeded the limits of presidential authority under the Constitution by federalizing the California National Guard without proper justification.

California had argued that the deployment undermined state sovereignty and breached the 10th Amendment, which reserves certain powers to the states. Breyer agreed, noting that local agencies such as the Los Angeles Police Department and the Sheriff’s Department maintained order during the demonstrations, despite incidents of violence and property damage. He concluded there was no evidence of a “rebellion” that would allow the president to invoke emergency powers.

According to evidence presented in court, guard members and Marines supported federal immigration raids by creating perimeters, directing traffic, and securing sites. They were also present during operations at marijuana farms and accompanied federal agents during enforcement actions across Southern California. Breyer wrote that these activities were indistinguishable from policing and went beyond the protection of federal property.

The ruling grants California’s request for an injunction, preventing the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense from directing guard members in the state to carry out arrests, searches, or riot control unless Congress provides a valid exception. The injunction does not require the immediate withdrawal of the 300 guard members still in Los Angeles but limits their activities to roles consistent with federal law.",https://www.lawcommentary.com/img/articles/rPGq3dx5Vy39XUZIdTpychuJfa50cfkuY56vjHEE.png?fit=crop&h=630&w=1200&signature=f52fc7caeb27121ecd078dc5c99486104322058382dc8c6d3ac8876a0c4d1995,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:53.691941

Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said that the Trump administration will soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, confirming plans for a stepped up presence of federal agents in the nation’s third-largest city.

Noem’s comments come after the DHS last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency’s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during an appearance CBS News’ ”Face the Nation.”

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump spoke out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago’s crime problems quickly “or we’re coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker have pushed back against the expected federal mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

Johnson has already signed an order barring the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts.

Pritzker in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation” charged that Trump’s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of immigration protests in the California city.

The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law.
He called that conduct a ""serious violation"" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.","Washington — A federal court in California ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed members of the National Guard and active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles earlier this summer in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations.

In a 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the president and his administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Breyer blocked the Trump administration from deploying or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops in the state, for civilian law enforcement.

His decision restricts the use of service members to engage in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures and traffic and crowd control. The injunction applies only to the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in California, not nationally, and it does not require the Defense Department to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops who remain in Los Angeles. Breyer noted that the administration is not prohibited from using troops consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, and wrote that they can continue to protect federal property in a manner allowed under the law.

The judge froze his injunction until noon on Sept. 12, likely to allow the Trump administration time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

Breyer's ruling came after he held a three-day trial in the case brought by California Gov. Gavin Newsom in June. Newsom, a Democrat, sued in response to Mr. Trump's decision to deploy members of California's National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against immigration enforcement operations taking place in the area. The president invoked a law known as Title 10 to send the California National Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property and personnel.

The judge granted temporary relief to California officials in June that required the Trump administration not to deploy the California National Guard in Los Angeles and return control to Newsom. But a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit found it likely that Mr. Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different law, Title 10.

Those earlier proceedings did not involve the Posse Comitatus Act. Breyer, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, held the trial on the merits of Newsom's arguments that the president violated that 147-year-old law last month.

The judge's ruling

The judge wrote in his ruling that the evidence put forth at the trial established that the Trump administration ""systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act,"" Breyer wrote.

While the Pentagon withdrew roughly the 700 U.S. Marines who had been sent to Los Angeles, Breyer noted that there are still 300 National Guard members stationed there nearly three months after they were first mobilized.

""Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country — including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California — thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,"" Breyer wrote.

The judge said that the Trump administration intentionally initiated the deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to establish a military presence there and enforce federal law. He called that conduct a ""serious violation"" of federal law prohibiting the use of the military for domestic law enforcement.

""In fact, these violations were part of a top-down, systemic effort by Defendants to use military troops to execute various sectors of federal law (the drug laws and the immigration laws at least) across hundreds of miles and over the course of several months — and counting,"" Breyer wrote.

Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the president's constitutional powers allow him to override the restrictions in the Posse Comitatus Act.

""Under this 'constitutional exception,' as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such 'protection' are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,"" he wrote. ""This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.""

The judge said that Congress was clear about what constitutes an exception to the law, precluding the president from exercising all but his express authority under the Constitution. He also accused the Trump administration of attempting to usurp Congress' authority.

""That Defendants characterize this as an 'exception' to the statute is mere wordplay; it does not change the fact that they seek to override Congress's legitimate exercise of its own authority,"" Breyer wrote.

Attorneys for California had sought an injunction that blocked National Guard forces from participating in and protecting federal agents during immigration enforcement operations, and Breyer agreed to grant their request. The Trump administration had argued that Title 10 is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and therefore didn't apply to National Guard troops who were called into federal service.

The judge wrote that while there is ""no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety,"" the Trump administration cannot ""use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go.""

Since the 9th Circuit allowed the Trump administration to keep the National Guard in California, the president has moved to deploy troops to Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump has also teased sending the National Guard to other major cities throughout the country in what he casts as a looming crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.

On behalf of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, I am writing to you regarding the 60th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva.

The HRC plays an essential role in the prevention of mass atrocity crimes by responding to situations where populations are at risk of, or are experiencing, genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity or ethnic cleansing. During its 44th session in July 2020 the HRC adopted Resolution 44/14 on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), recognizing the important contribution of the UN human rights system in addressing situations where there is a risk of atrocity crimes being committed. This is in line with the Council’s prevention mandate, enshrined in UN General Assembly Resolution 60/251, which stipulates that it shall “contribute, through dialogue and cooperation, towards the prevention of human rights violations and respond promptly to human rights emergencies.”

We strongly urge you, as a current member of the HRC, to uphold this shared commitment to prevent atrocity crimes. The Global Centre respectfully encourages you to consider the following recommendations as you engage in the 60th regular session:

Afghanistan

Since the Taliban de facto authorities assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021, they have imposed deeply repressive policies, denying women, girls and LGBTQIA+ persons their fundamental rights. These measures constitute extreme gender-based discrimination and blatantly violate the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). In August 2024 the Taliban codified over 100 edicts through so-called “vice and virtue” laws, aiming to eradicate women and girls from public life by mandating full face coverings, prohibiting them from speaking or being heard in public and severely restricting their freedom of movement, expression, employment, political participation and access to education and healthcare. Others are targeted for expressions of sexuality or gender identity deemed inconsistent with Taliban policy. These policies are intended to subject women and girls to total domination and amount to the crime against humanity of gender persecution.

In June 2025 the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan released a report detailing how the de facto authorities are dismantling and transforming the country’s judicial and legal architecture to create a justice system that not only enforces their repressive ideology but is also central to their system of gender-based discrimination and exclusion.

Former government officials, journalists, human rights defenders and minority communities continue to face widespread and systematic abuses, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and torture. Meanwhile, coordinated attacks on ethnic and religious groups by the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan likely amount to crimes against humanity. Amid immigration crackdowns in the United States, Pakistan and Iran, Afghan nationals, including refugees, migrants and those awaiting resettlement, face mounting risks of forced repatriation and shrinking options for protection under Taliban rule.

The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to utilize the upcoming Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on Afghanistan, currently scheduled for 8 September, to emphasize the urgent need for justice and accountability for likely atrocity crimes. We encourage member states to condemn ongoing CEDAW violations, reaffirm the responsibility of states to uphold its provisions and to support codifying gender apartheid as a crime against humanity.

Delegations should also stress the protection of women’s rights and that women human rights defenders and civil society must be meaningfully included in all political processes to help shape Afghanistan’s future. Any credible political settlement must be rooted in human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls.

Burundi

Burundi has endured a protracted political crisis since late President Pierre Nkurunziza’s announcement that he would seek a third presidential term in 2015. In its first report in 2017, the UN Commission of Inquiry (CoI) on Burundi concluded that potential crimes against humanity had been committed since April 2015, including extrajudicial killings and summary executions, disappearances, sexual violence, arbitrary detention and torture. The CoI continued to release annual reports in subsequent years, reiterating concerns about serious violations that may constitute crimes against humanity. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burundi, as well as numerous civil society organizations, have further documented systematic human rights violations and abuses.

A decade since the crisis first escalated, no perpetrators have been held accountable, including within the ruling party Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratie-Forces de défense de la démocratie (CNDD-FDD) and its youth wing, the Imbonerakure. During the HRC’s 59th session in June 2025, Special Rapporteur Fortuné Gaetan Zongo warned that “impunity remains the norm [and is] a major obstacle to reconciliation, [and that] justice is being used against opponents, journalists and human rights defenders.”

Ongoing monitoring and reporting on Burundi’s protracted crisis are critical amid the ongoing electoral cycle, including presidential elections currently scheduled for 2027. The June 2025 legislative and communal elections were marred by widespread irregularities, with the ruling CNDD-FDD winning 96.5 percent of votes amid intimidation, harassment and threats by party officials and the Imbonerakure, while key opposition figures were barred from running. This follows similar patterns to previous voting cycles, during which repression dramatically intensified.

Following the May 2020 presidential election, the CoI released a detailed assessment using the UN Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes. It warned that all risk factors for crimes against humanity remain present in Burundi, including the CNDD-FDD’s system of governance, the appointment of sanctioned individuals to senior government positions, the continued operations of the Imbonerakure and the refusal to release all detained human rights defenders. Five years on, these risk factors remain in place and in recent months there has been a marked increase in hate speech and inflammatory rhetoric, including at the highest political level. A joint NGO letter released on 20 August warned that some of the risk factors outlined in the UN Framework of Analysis, “including Risk Factor 8 (“triggering factors or events that may seriously exacerbate existing conditions, such as elections and pivotal activities related to elections”), point to more, not fewer, concerns than one year ago, before the electoral cycle opened and the ruling party closed avenues for peaceful transition through competitive, free and fair elections.”

International scrutiny remains vital to prevent the recurrence of crimes against humanity in Burundi. The Global Centre therefore respectfully urges you to adopt a resolution to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and request the Special Rapporteur to present an oral update during the HRC’s 62nd session, as well as a comprehensive report to the HRC during its 63rd session and to the UN General Assembly during its 81st session.

Central African Republic

Civilians in the Central African Republic (CAR) continue to be at risk of atrocities due to ongoing instability by myriad armed groups and abuses by government and allied forces. The Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC), a loose alliance of predatory armed groups with a history of perpetrating atrocities, and its dissident factions have continued to perpetrate attacks. During counteroffensives, the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) and allied mercenaries have disproportionately targeted ethnic and religious minorities.

Inter-communal tensions have also heightened due to increased targeting along ethnic lines by armed groups, notably the Azande Ani Kpi Gbe (AAKG) in southeast CAR. A report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and peacekeeping mission (MINUSCA) documents likely war crimes, primarily targeting Muslim communities and Sudanese refugees in the southeast. The report utilizes the UN’s Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes, warning that there are significant risks of recurrence, including the tolerance of hate speech on ethnic and religious grounds, a lack of state presence, unclear chain of command and a prevailing climate of impunity. Recent fighting in the southeast between the AAKG, FACA and mercenaries has also resulted in serious human rights violations and abuses.

During the HRC’s 58th session, Valentine Rugwabiza, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of MINUSCA, stressed that CAR is at a “crossroads” and that extending state authority must be grounded in justice and respect for human rights. The local and presidential elections scheduled for December are critical to the consolidation of peace in CAR; however, authorities have cracked down on civic space. CAR has a history of election-related violence, including most recently during the elections in December 2020, when the CPC launched an offensive against the government. This period was marked by heightened grievances, the proliferation of hate speech and escalating violence targeting civilians.

The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in CAR, who works closely with MINUSCA and the Special Criminal Court, is essential for supporting accountability and transitional justice mechanisms and providing critical capacity-building to strengthen institutions on human rights promotion and protection. The Global Centre respectfully encourages you to adopt a resolution to renew the mandate of the Independent Expert and support the inclusion of R2P language in the resolution by “recalling that the authorities of the Central African Republic have the primary responsibility to protect all populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” We also encourage your delegation to request continued monitoring and reporting of human rights trends – using the Framework of Analysis – to alert the international community of appropriate prevention and protection strategies.

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

In its landmark 2014 report, the HRC-mandated CoI on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) established responsibility at the highest level of government for ongoing crimes against humanity, as well as other continued systematic and widespread human rights violations, including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions, sexual violence, persecution, forcible transfer, enforced disappearance and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The DPRK’s extensive forced labor system and ongoing human rights violations have enabled its support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Notably, the DPRK has reportedly deployed 11,000 troops to bolster Russia’s military efforts.

On the 10th anniversary of the CoI report, the HRC adopted a resolution mandating the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive update on the human rights situation in the DPRK since 2014 and to assess the implementation of the CoI’s recommendations. As the Council considers the forthcoming report, member states should use the Enhanced Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of the North Korean people and the prevention of crimes against humanity. States should call for a holistic UN response that bridges human rights, humanitarian and security approaches. This must include measures to confront structural drivers of violations – such as the institutionalized use of forced labor and pervasive sexual and gender-based violence – while closing enforcement gaps and enhancing transparency in global supply chains, ensuring that exploitation is neither profitable nor tolerated.

States must also uphold the principle of non-refoulement, ensure access to asylum and provide comprehensive support for refugees and escapees. Approaches to accountability must be survivor-centered, recognizing that meaningful redress extends beyond legal prosecution. Victims and survivors should be actively included in shaping justice processes, policy decisions and any future political arrangements affecting the Korean Peninsula, so that their dignity, agency and well-being are placed at the core of international responses. Sustained attention to these priorities is essential to end ongoing atrocities, prevent future violations and affirm the rights of those who have endured decades of repression.

Democratic Republic of the Congo

Since early 2025 populations in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have faced a grave escalation in widespread abuses and likely atrocity crimes, as the March 23 Movement (M23) armed group, bolstered by the Rwandan Defense Forces, intensified its offensive in North and South Kivu. The group has seized the provincial capitals and consolidated control over key territories. Clashes between M23 and the Congolese armed forces (FARDC), supported by a coalition of militias known as the Wazalendo, have killed at least 7,000 people and displaced over one million people since January. Despite recent diplomatic efforts, including the signing of a peace agreement between the DRC and Rwanda and a declaration of principles signed by the DRC and M23 to end the fighting, insecurity remains high. Meanwhile, other armed groups continue to pose a grave threat to civilians in North Kivu and neighboring Ituri province. Sexual and gender-based violence, used as a weapon of war, has reached unprecedented levels.

At the root of the enduring instability lies rampant impunity for past abuses and a thriving conflict economy, largely driven by the illicit exploitation of mineral resources. As UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif has emphasized, any lasting resolution must address these underlying causes, particularly the illegal extraction of natural wealth.

In response to the deteriorating crisis, the HRC held a special session in February at the request of the DRC government, unanimously adopting a resolution that established a Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) and CoI. These mechanisms are mandated to investigate and report on serious human rights abuses and violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) committed in North and South Kivu provinces since January 2022. They are crucial for advancing justice by identifying those responsible and supporting victims’ and survivors’ rights to truth, justice and reparations.

Given the scale and urgency of the crisis, the Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to participate in the upcoming Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on the DRC. The Global Centre also encourages you to raise awareness about atrocity risks in eastern DRC, highlight the central role of illicit mineral exploitation in fueling violence and support the FFM through sustained political and financial commitments. We further encourage you to support the renewal of the mandate of the International Team of Experts on the DRC for one year, requesting that the Team provide technical assistance to national authorities to combat impunity and regularly report on potential atrocity crimes, alerting the HRC with timely and targeted recommendations for necessary action.

Haiti

The human rights and protection situation in Haiti has become catastrophic amid rampant and expanding gang violence across Port-au-Prince and the Centre and Artibonite departments. Gangs affiliated with the Viv Ansanm coalition are perpetrating widespread abuses, including indiscriminate killings, torture, kidnappings, forced recruitment and the burning and looting of civilian infrastructure, in a climate of total impunity. These groups are also using systematic and widespread sexual violence against women and girls, including collective rape, sexual slavery and mutilation, as a means of exerting territorial control and to terrorize and punish communities. Vigilante and so-called self-defense groups – formed to protect communities, often with tacit police support – have also increasingly perpetrated abuses and indiscriminate violence. According to the UN, between 3 October 2024 and 30 June at least 4,864 people were killed, 1,597 injured and 775 kidnapped.

The Haitian National Police lack the capacity to combat gangs and protect communities. A newly formed task force has launched operations targeting gang strongholds, but the use of drone strikes involving explosive munitions has further endangered civilians. Despite the deployment of the UN-authorized Multidimensional Security Support (MSS) mission, security has deteriorated. The MSS continues to face financial and operational constraints, hindering its ability to challenge gang control. Meanwhile, the international community, particularly the UN Security Council, has failed to mobilize a decisive response, risking further isolation of Haiti and turmoil when robust international support is critically needed.

The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to utilize the upcoming Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner and his Designated Expert on Haiti to stress that overly securitized international approaches will not result in lasting stability and may exacerbate risk factors for violence. Moreover, we encourage your delegation to highlight the critical importance of human rights monitoring and reporting for informing the international community of appropriate prevention and protection strategies, particularly as violence spreads to areas with inadequate police presence. Lastly, we encourage your delegation to insist on the need to renew the mandate of the Designated Expert in full at the 62nd session in April.

Myanmar (Burma)

Since the military coup in February 2021 and the imposition of prolonged states of emergency, populations in Myanmar (Burma) have endured escalating human rights and humanitarian crises. The conflict now affects 13 of the country’s 15 states and regions, with civilians threatened by junta attacks and clashes involving armed groups. The military has committed widespread abuses on the civilian population, including relentless airstrikes, scorched-earth operations and systematic assaults, as well as obstructed humanitarian aid, particularly in anti-military strongholds. The High Commissioner has reported atrocities, including attacks on aid workers and the burning alive, dismemberment, rape and beheading of civilians unable to escape. At least 7,035 people have been killed by junta forces, over 22,263 remain imprisoned and 19.9 million require humanitarian aid – one million more than in 2024. Anti-junta armed groups have also been implicated in abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, forced recruitment and other serious violations. Last year saw the highest civilian death toll since the coup.

Prior to the coup, in August 2017 the military launched so-called “clearance operations” in Rakhine State with the purported aim of confronting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. During those operations, the majority of Myanmar’s Rohingya population were forced to flee, leaving over 900,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. A UN FFM determined these operations amounted to genocide. Following renewed conflict in late 2023, the military and ethnic Arakan Army (AA) have perpetrated abuses in Rakhine, including indiscriminate airstrikes, drone attacks, shelling, forced displacement, burning of homes, destruction of towns and extrajudicial killings of civilians attempting to flee. Over 400,000 people are internally displaced across Rakhine and Chin States while approximately 200,000 have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late 2023.

The HRC established the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) in 2018 to collect, preserve and analyze evidence of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Myanmar since 2011. During the Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on the reports of the IIMM and High Commissioner on the human rights situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Myanmar, we encourage your delegation to raise the ongoing violations and risks facing the Rohingya. Discussions on repatriation must prioritize the protection of the Rohingya, particularly given that both the junta and AA continue to pose serious threats to vulnerable civilians. We also urge your delegation to highlight the worsening humanitarian situation in Rakhine State and in refugee camps in Bangladesh, where funding shortfalls and aid cuts threaten to reduce food rations and deny victims and survivors access to basic services.

Occupied Palestinian Territory

Since 7 October 2023, Israel has significantly escalated its policy of mass arrests and detentions under the pretext of security concerns – alongside the commission of atrocities in Gaza and the Occupied West Bank – detaining thousands of Palestinians across Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). By August 2024, nearly 10,000 Palestinians were being held in Israeli jails, roughly twice the number detained at the onset of Israel’s assault on Gaza. According to UN experts, approximately one-third of these individuals were held in administrative detention, a form of arbitrary detention in which individuals are held without charge or trial. Those who are charged and prosecuted face a near-perfect conviction rate in Israel’s military courts.

Israel’s long-standing practice of administrative detention has been wielded as a tool of repression against Palestinians since the beginning of its military occupation in 1967. This practice has entrenched patterns of detaining Palestinians based on “secret” evidence, subjecting them to indefinite detention through repeated renewals and routine violations of due process rights. Israel also remains the only country in the world to try children in military courts. As of March 2025, 119 of the 323 Palestinian children in custody were being held in administrative detention – the highest number recorded since 2017.

The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) has repeatedly asserted that Israel’s widespread and systematic arbitrary detention of Palestinians may amount to a crime against humanity. In August 2023 the UN Special Rapporteur on situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 described Israel’s arbitrary detention policy as a “key instrument of domination and oppression,” which has resulted in “an entire occupied population framed as a security threat, often presumed guilty, and punished with incarceration even when trying to exercise fundamental freedoms.”

The WGAD has adopted three opinions concerning the cases of seven individuals detained by Israeli forces since October 2023. In all cases, the WGAD concluded that their detention constituted arbitrary detention in violation of international law. The WGAD determined that the arrests and detentions were conducted on “discriminatory grounds, namely [their] national, ethnic and social origin as Palestinians.”

In September 2024 the CoI on the OPT, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, issued a report describing Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinian detainees as an “intentional policy,” involving acts that amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. Detainees were deliberately humiliated – including through physical, psychological, sexual and reproductive violence – used as human shields and frequently denied adequate food and medical care.

On 16 September the HRC will hold an Interactive Dialogue on the report of the WGAD. The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to actively participate in this discussion and express concern regarding Israel’s systematic use of arbitrary detention against Palestinians. We encourage your delegation to support the renewal of the WGAD’s mandate, call for an end to Israel’s practice of arbitrary detention, including administrative detention, and urge Israel to fully and transparently cooperate with the WGAD, including by granting unfettered access to its mandate-holders.

Somalia

Populations in Somalia remain at risk of atrocity crimes amid ongoing conflict and attacks perpetrated by armed extremist groups, particularly Al-Shabaab, and the forces combating them. According to the UN Secretary-General, at least 179 civilians were killed between 23 September 2024 to 23 March 2025, representing a 34 percent increase compared to the previous reporting period. At least 49 percent were killed in attacks perpetrated by Al-Shabaab. Populations also remain vulnerable as the government works to strengthen its ability to ensure protection following the drawdown of the African Union (AU) Transitional Mission and handover of security responsibilities to Somali forces.

The Independent Expert on the human rights situation in Somalia plays a vital role in supporting the government in addressing these ongoing challenges. The Global Centre therefore respectfully urges the renewal of the Independent Expert’s mandate and the inclusion of R2P language in the resolution, reaffirming that “the Federal Government of Somalia bears the primary responsibility to protect civilians from war crimes and crimes against humanity.”

Sudan

Since April 2023 an armed confrontation between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has resulted in tens of thousands of people killed across Sudan amid heavy fighting, aerial bombardments and shelling, including in densely populated areas. Reports have emerged of armed actors perpetrating widespread sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, as well as reports of forced evictions in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities. The RSF have utilized the conflict to accelerate a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing and large-scale attacks targeting non-Arab communities in Darfur and other regions, perpetrating possible acts of genocide.

For over a year, the RSF has tightened its territorial control around El Fasher, North Darfur, blocking crucial supply routes and escalating attacks on surrounding areas. Indiscriminate airstrikes and targeted violence have killed civilians and destroyed entire communities. Since 12 April 2025 the RSF have taken over Zamzam camp, southwest of El Fasher, reportedly committing widespread abuses and forcibly displacing hundreds of thousands of residents. The RSF have also further expanded the geographic scope of its attacks on civilians in North Kordofan, where over 450 civilians have been killed near the city of Bara since 12 July. Several senior UN officials have raised alarm about the escalation, with the Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide reiterating that the risk factors for genocide and related crimes remain present.

During May 2023 the HRC established an international independent FFM for Sudan. With a mandate to investigate human rights and IHL violations and preserve evidence for future legal proceedings, among other tasks, the FFM has a crucial role to play in delivering justice for affected communities. As the conflict shows no sign of abating, with both parties entrenched in their positions and unwilling to de-escalate, sustained international scrutiny and pressure are crucial to hold perpetrators accountable and support sustainable peace and humanitarian relief for all populations.

The Global Centre respectfully urges your delegation to support a full two-year extension of the FFM to enable it to carry out its work. We also urge your delegation to request regular FFM updates, including oral briefings and reports at upcoming HRC sessions, followed by enhanced interactive dialogues with key stakeholders – including the High Commissioner, AU representatives, the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, civil society and victims and survivors – and for these reports to be presented to the General Assembly at its 81st and 82nd sessions. We also urge your delegation to recommend that the General Assembly submit the FFM’s reports to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including holding perpetrators accountable through expanded ICC jurisdiction across Sudan and the consideration of targeted sanctions. Lastly, it is important to emphasize that the HRC will remain actively seized of the matter, including by assessing the developing situation and identifying appropriate responses. This is in line with a joint NGO letter released on 15 August.

Ukraine

Since the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces have used indiscriminate explosive weapons and committed widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity, including indiscriminate shelling, systematic torture and sexual and gender-based violence. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) has documented the widespread use of heavy artillery, unguided missiles, airstrikes and prohibited cluster munitions in populated areas. Civilian casualties have risen sharply since March 2024, due in large part to Russia’s escalating deployment of high-impact air-dropped glide bombs. These long-range weapons have caused devastating harm to civilians, striking far beyond front lines with poor precision. Schools, homes, healthcare facilities, water and sanitation infrastructure and energy systems have all been severely affected. As of June 2025, the UN has verified over 13,580 civilian deaths, while noting that the true number is likely far higher. The invasion has triggered a dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 10 million people displaced, including over 6.5 million who have fled to neighboring countries.

During the discussion following the oral update from the Independent International CoI on Ukraine, we encourage member states to highlight the devastating toll the ongoing, intractable conflict has taken on civilians and call for measures to limit Russia’s ability to continue to perpetrate atrocities. All peace efforts must be centered around safety, justice and redress for Ukraine’s civilians.

Venezuela

In the year since Venezuela’s discredited presidential elections, President Nicolás Maduro has tightened his grip on power through a systematic and intensified crackdown on dissent. State agents have systematically targeted ordinary citizens, opposition members, journalists and human rights defenders, including through mass arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and other serious human rights violations and abuses. This wave of repression has been accompanied by hate speech and inflammatory rhetoric from high-level officials. Military personnel face heightened risks, including enforced disappearances, as part of efforts to maintain internal obedience. The 25 May parliamentary and regional elections were also marked by intensified repression, particularly targeting opposition figures and human rights defenders. With much of the opposition boycotting the vote and voter turnout low, the ruling party secured control of most governorships and retained the National Assembly.

The HRC-mandated FFM on Venezuela warned of “the accelerated reactivation of the repressive machinery that was never dismantled and is now being used to undermine the public freedoms of citizens.” On 14 May the FFM expressed grave concern over practices of enforced disappearances and the widespread lack of effective judicial protection, warning that “these acts are being committed in Venezuela as part of the crime against humanity of political persecution (…) They are part of a series of actions carried out under a coordinated plan to silence, discourage, and suppress the opposition.”

On 26 June OHCHR published a report documenting post-electoral repression and raised concern over its limited country team access to Venezuela, which significantly affects its ability to carry out its monitoring, reporting and technical assistance mandate. Days later, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk was declared persona non grata, threatening OHCHR’s country presence and work with victim and survivor communities.

Since its establishment in 2019, the FFM has repeatedly found that some violations and abuses committed since at least 2014 were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population and are “part of a plan orchestrated at the highest levels of the government to repress dissent through crimes against humanity.”

The ongoing repression and political persecution have been enabled by the government’s deliberate dismantling of remaining institutional safeguards for civic space and the protection of civil and political rights. Since August 2024 the National Assembly has passed a series of restrictions, including legislation known as the “NGO Law,” jeopardizing the work, safety and security of organizations across the country, as well as other measures to criminalize political opposition. Attorney General Tarek William Saab regularly threatens to arrest human rights defenders engaging with UN mechanisms and authorities have increasingly used short-term enforced disappearances to instill fear and crush dissent. As of 4 August, Venezuelan human rights NGO Foro Penal documented 807 political prisoners, including 83 third-state nationals.

While Venezuela has experienced a protracted multidimensional crisis for over a decade, current tensions and patterns of repression are unprecedented and leave populations at imminent risk of crimes against humanity. The Global Centre therefore respectfully encourages you to participate in the Interactive Dialogue with the FFM, currently scheduled for 22 September, and call upon the Venezuelan government to immediately cease enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and other systematic violations and abuses of human rights. We also encourage you to demand the release of all individuals arbitrarily detained. Lastly, the Global Centre urges you to call on the Venezuelan government to immediately grant all OHCHR staff access to the country and fully cooperate with the FFM.",http://www.globalr2p.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/UN-HRC-Voting.png,N,,2025-09-02 12:57:10.911175

""I strongly object to the Office of Management and Budget’s unlawful attempt to pursue a nearly $5 billion pocket rescission,"" Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a post to X. ""Congress alone bears the constitutional responsibility for funding our government, and any effort to claw back resources outside of the appropriations process undermines that responsibility.""

Murkowski argued that the move would ""only threaten the good bipartisan work that has been done in committee and on the floor, and risk throwing the entire process into chaos.""

Her criticism comes after Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, slammed the so-called rescissions package last week, saying that ""any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.""

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and personal lawyer for Trump, has been discharged from a New Hampshire hospital after being injured in a car crash over the weekend, his spokesman said in a statement this morning.

“Mayor Giuliani is progressing well following the motor vehicle accident that occurred Saturday evening, shortly after the mayor and I stopped to help what appeared to be a person in need of immediate assistance,"" said the spokesman, Ted Goodman.

""He has been discharged from the hospital and appreciates the love, well wishes and prayers,” he added

Giuliani’s head of security, Michael Ragusa, said Sunday that Giuliani sustained injuries including a spinal fracture after he was “struck from behind at high speed” while riding as a passenger in a vehicle on a highway in New Hampshire.

He said before the crash, Giuliani had been “flagged down by a woman who was the victim of a domestic violence incident,” and he “immediately rendered assistance and contacted 911,” staying on scene until police arrived.

In a later statement Sunday, Ragusa offered conflicting details, alleging that in ""a surprising turn of events, it was later determined that the woman was the aggressor, while the boyfriend — found bloodied and in poor condition — was taken to the hospital for treatment.""

Trump posted on social media yesterday that he plans on awarding Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

The president is expected to announce this afternoon that U.S. Space Command’s headquarters will move from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama, two defense officials said. Two other sources familiar with the White House’s plans confirmed the 2 p.m. Oval Office announcement today would indeed focus on U.S. Space Command.

The site of the command’s headquarters has been something of a political football, reaching back across the last two administrations, with the Colorado and Alabama congressional delegations jostling to land the site.

Last week Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey seemed to tease the decision, saying she had been in touch with the president and was “very optimistic” the move would soon be announced.

U.S. stocks and bonds fell sharply this morningy, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 1.2%, the Nasdaq falling 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling about 400 points.

U.S. Treasury yields also rose to highs not seen for months. The higher that the yields are, the more costly it is for the U.S. government to borrow money.

Those moves came after a panel of judges ruled Friday that most ofTrump's sweeping country-specific tariffs are illegal. However, tariffs can stay in place while the legal process plays out.

The ruling has raised concerns that the U.S. might have to refund more than $120 billion in tariff revenue collected so far this year. That amount of refunds could force the government to tap the markets to borrow more money and would mean that the tariff funds are not helping to reduce the country's debt.

More than 450 economists from private industry and academia have signed an “open letter” to Trump and Congress expressing ""our strong support for Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook and for the longstanding principle of central bank independence.”

Some of the notable signatories include Trevon Logan, an economics professor at Ohio State University who has co-written a number of papers with Cook; former Fed economists Claudia Sahm and Julia Coronado; former chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer (under Barack Obama), Jared Bernstein (under Joe Biden) and Joseph Stiglitz (under Bill Clinton).

""Good economic policy requires credible monetary institutions,"" the letter says. ""Credible monetary institutions, in turn, require the independence of the Federal Reserve. A large body of research confirms that countries with more independent central banks achieve better economic outcomes.""

Cook is suing Trump over what she is calling his ""unprecedented and illegal"" effort to remove her from the Fed.

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is expected to file a discharge petition this afternoon to try to force a floor vote on requiring the Department of Justice to hand over files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Massie had originally introduced the petition in July with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; now that Congress is back from recess, they will need to gather 218 signatures to force the vote.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has rejected the effort, arguing that the DOJ is already cooperating with the House Oversight Committee.

GOP leaders have also added a bill to the list of legislation the House will consider this week that would direct the House Oversight Committee to “continue its ongoing investigation into the possible mismanagement of the Federal government’s investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell.”

The bill is unnecessary from an investigative standpoint because the Oversight Committee does not need the full House to approve or direct its efforts. The legislation could be a way for the speaker to placate members of the party who would like to see members vote on something Epstein-related amid criticism from Democrats who have been pushing for the release of the files.

Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement detailing his decision not to seek re-election after decades in Congress.

""This decision has not been easy,"" he said. ""But I know in my heart it is the right one and that it is the right time to pass the torch to a new generation.""

Nadler laid out his career highlights, including legislation ""on voting rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ2+ rights, immigration and gun safety,"" he said.

Nadler told The New York Times, which first reported the news of his retirement, that ""watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that.""

A federal grand jury sitting in Washington declined to return an indictment against a woman whom the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia accused of threatening to take the life of the president and transmitting threats over state lines on Instagram and Facebook.

Nathalie Rose Jones of Indiana allegedly threatened Trump and called him a “terrorist” and a “Nazi” in a voluntary interview with the Secret Service. She attended a march Aug. 16 that went around the White House complex and was then arrested, although she said she had no present desire to harm Trump.

In a motion yesterday, her defense attorneys disclosed that a grand jury didn’t indict Jones.

“A grand jury has now found no probable cause to indict Ms. Jones on the charged offenses,” her federal public defenders wrote.

Friends wrote that Jones had mental health issues.

NBC News reported last week that a federal grand jury declined to indict a former Justice Department employee who was seen on camera throwing a hoagie at the chest of a federal officer deployed in the nation’s capital.

Republican Jack Ciattarelli has launched his first TV ad of the general election in New Jersey governor’s race, one of two gubernatorial contests this year. In the ad, Ciattarelli looks to head off attempts to tie him to Trump and links his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, to the state’s current Democratic governor, Phil Murphy.

“We all know it. New Jersey’s a mess, and all Mikie Sherrill wants to talk about is President Trump,” Ciattarelli says in the ad in a quintessential New Jersey diner. “Come on, what does the president have to do with rising property taxes and higher electricity bills?”

“New Jersey’s a mess because out-of-touch politicians like Phil Murphy and Mikie Sherrill care more about pronouns and sanctuary cities than they do solving our problems,” Ciattarelli says. “That changes when I’m governor. I’ll lower electricity bills, cut and cap property taxes, and keep our community safe. Folks, it’s time to fix New Jersey. When I’m governor, we will.”

Sherrill is also hitting the airwaves this week, with her ad buy set to start tomorrow, according to AdImpact.

The year’s lone pair of gubernatorial elections are only two months away, providing one of the biggest tests for both parties since the 2024 presidential contest.

In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are locked in a competitive race that has been defined by affordability issues and the popularity of Trump and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger has seen success in polls by blasting Republican Winsome Earle-Sears over Trump’s massive tax cut and spending law and putting economic issues at the forefront of her message. But Earle-Sears, the state’s lieutenant governor, seems to have made up ground during the summer, with early voting kicking off in just over two weeks.

Trump pointed to crime in Chicago over the holiday weekend, claiming in a post on Truth Social that Chicago is ""the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far.""

""Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet,"" he said, referring to Illinois' governor. ""I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon.""

Trump has previously floated sending troops to Chicago as he did in Washington, D.C. Many D.C. residents have criticized Trump's deployment of troops in the city as unnecessary and an overreach.

He is losing in court in ways that he did not anticipate.”

Washington, D.C. – Today, Democracy Forward’s critical leadership and work as the “single largest source of Trump’s legal troubles” during the Trump-Vance administration was highlighted in The Atlantic article, “The Anti-Trump Resistance That’s Actually Working.”

The story argues that the “legal resistance led by a patchwork coalition of lawyers, public-interest groups, Democratic state attorneys general, and unions has frustrated Trump’s ambitions.” It focuses on the work of Democracy Forward and other partners who are taking on the Trump-Vance administration in court and winning for the American people.

Democracy Forward President & CEO Skye Perryman called attention to the critical work in response to the Trump-Vance administration’s anti-democratic actions. Perryman shares insights into the early response to the Trump-Vance administration. “We knew that if the federal landscape were to regress, people would have very few levers of power left. They would be able to go to the streets and to vote, and they would be able to use litigation.”

Perryman also previewed the upcoming fights ahead, “The demand for lawyers that are willing to defend people from the government is exponentially greater today than it was on day one. We believe the next 200 days are going to be even more significant than the first 200 days.”

Since the 2025 inauguration, Democracy Forward has emerged as a critical bulwark against the harmful and unlawful actions of the federal Executive Branch. The organization has filed more than 100 legal actions and launched 110 investigations, securing multiple significant victories to stop the Trump-Vance administration’s harmful and anti-democratic policies on behalf of people, communities, unions, nonprofit organizations, veterans groups, parents, educators, houses of worship, and more. The organization is also active in protecting people and communities from abuses of power at the state and local level.

The Atlantic: The Anti-Trump Strategy That’s Actually Working

Lawsuits, lawsuits, and more lawsuits

By Michael Scherer

Days after Attorney General Pam Bondi tried to put an end to the Justice Department’s revelations about Jeffrey Epstein, captains of the legal resistance gathered by Zoom. Norm Eisen, a former attorney for Barack Obama’s White House, had convened lawyers, Democratic communications strategists, a neoconservative Trump critic, and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. This one was big, Eisen said from his parked car in Baltimore, where he had traveled for a lawsuit to overturn President Donald Trump’s cuts to AmeriCorps. They should move quickly.

“The Trump-Epstein story is the story of the Trump administration—corruption benefiting his rich and powerful cronies at the expense of vulnerable people,” Eisen explained as I lurked on the July call with his permission.

The plan was to file a Hail Mary lawsuit to force the Department of Justice to release any documents in its possession that tie Epstein, a convicted child sex offender, to Trump. Eisen’s team had already filed the request for anything that connects the two men, under the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIA is normally a weak tool for unlocking investigative records gathered for criminal investigations, but Eisen had a legal theory: Because the DOJ had argued under pressure after Bondi’s announcement that the extraordinary public interest in the Epstein case required the unsealing of grand-jury testimony, they could argue the same thing. And that was just the beginning.

Eisen, who has pursued more than 100 legal matters against Trump since his second inauguration, explained that he wanted to try the case in the court of law and the court of public opinion. He asked for an update on an op-ed he had written raising questions about “a potential cover up” of Trump’s dealings with Epstein. He wanted a plan from Lavora Barnes, the former Michigan party chair, about how they would get elected leaders to discuss the Epstein records. He wanted a press plan to publicize the requests they had already filed, and the lawsuit they would file a few weeks later. A discussion followed about whether they should also try to intervene in the Justice Department’s effort to unseal grand-jury testimony, how many of the Epstein records they should demand to release, and how the Epstein issue fit with other arguments against Trump. “We have an extremely strong horse right now. Let’s just ride that,” said Bill Kristol, the resident neoconservative. “We want to know what’s going on with the Epstein files.”

The first seven months of Trump’s Oval Office do-over have been, with occasional exception, a tale of ruthless domination. The Democratic opposition is feeble and fumbling, the federal bureaucracy traumatized and neutered. Corporate leaders come bearing gifts, the Republican Party has been scrubbed of dissent, and the street protests are diminished in size. Even the news media, a major check on Trump’s power in his first term, have faded from their 2017 ferocity, hobbled by budget cuts, diminished ratings, and owners wary of crossing the president.

One exception has stood out: A legal resistance led by a patchwork coalition of lawyers, public-interest groups, Democratic state attorneys general, and unions has frustrated Trump’s ambitions. Hundreds of attorneys and plaintiffs have stood up to him, feeding a steady assembly line of setbacks and judicial reprimands for a president who has systematically sought to break down limits on his own power. Of the 384 cases filed through August 28 against the Trump administration, 130 have led to orders blocking at least part of the president’s efforts, and 148 cases await a ruling, according to a review by Just Security. Dozens of those rulings are the final word, with no appeal by the government, and others have been stayed on appeal, including by the Supreme Court.

“The only place we had any real traction was to start suing, because everything else was inert,” Eisen told me. “Trump v. the Rule of Law is like the fight of the century between Ali and Frazier, or the Thrilla in Manila or the Rumble in the Jungle. It’s a great heavyweight battle.”

The legal scorecard so far is more than enough to provoke routine cries of “judicial tyranny” by Trump and his advisers. “Unelected rogue judges are trying to steal years of time from a 4 year term,” reads one typical social-media complaint from Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller. “It’s the most egregious theft one can imagine.”

But Miller’s fury was, in part, misdirected. Before there can be rulings from judges, there must be plaintiffs who bring a case, investigators who collect facts and declarations about the harm caused, and lawyers who can shape it all into legal theories that make their way to judicial opinions. This backbone of the Trump resistance has as much in common with political organizing and investigative reporting as it does with legal theory.

“It should give great pause to the American public that parties are being recruited to harm the agenda the American people elected President Trump to implement,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told me in a statement.

Even those at the center of the fight against Trump view their greatest accomplishments as going beyond the temporary restraining orders or permanent injunctions they won. Without the court fights, the public would not know about many of the activities of Elon Musk’s DOGE employees in the early months of the administration. They would not have read headlines in which federal judges accuse the president’s team of perpetrating a “sham” or taking actions “shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” Kilmar Abrego Garcia would not have become a household name. Even cases that Trump ultimately won on appeal—such as his ability to fire transgender soldiers, defund scientific research, and dismiss tens of thousands of government employees—were delayed and kept in the news by the judicial process.

In Trump immigration cases, it’s one thing in public, another in court

Since Inauguration Day, executive orders have been defanged or blocked, agency closures delayed, government-employee firings reversed. Deportation flights have been delayed, law firms have freed themselves from Trump’s retaliation, and foreign students have won the ability to continue studying at U.S. universities. Courts have forced the president to restore cut services and spending to AmeriCorps, the U.S. African Development Foundation, the CDC, and other agencies. They have upended an effort by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to make it more difficult to release unaccompanied minors from government custody and forced Trump to pay for foreign-aid bills he had hoped to stiff-arm. A federal appeals court ruled Friday that many of Trump’s tariffs were illegal, setting up a likely hearing by the Supreme Court.

“The biggest victory, I think, has been in terms of highlighting the egregious nature of what Trump is doing,” Rushab Sanghvi, the general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, told me. “It is getting the public to understand how terrible it is.”

The groundwork for these victories was laid before Trump was even reelected, in a series of summits in 2023 and 2024. Universities hosted symposiums. Organized labor held private meetings. International experts, who had been studying Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, warned that Trump would move quickly and try to overwhelm his opponents. “We needed to flood the zone with rule-of-law shock and awe,” Eisen told me after the Zoom call.

The plan that emerged was not focused on centralizing a response, but on running a barrage of coordinated efforts. Attorneys general would represent states, advocacy groups such as Public Citizen and the ACLU would focus on their areas of expertise, and the unions would gather stories from their members and identify plaintiffs who could show harm. Atop this infrastructure, new organizations took shape, bringing in tens of millions of dollars to pay for it all.

The offices of Democracy Forward, the single largest source of Trump’s legal troubles, look from the inside like those of any corporate Washington law firm. From the building’s corner windows, the group’s more than 130 staff members—about half of them attorneys—can just make out the White House a couple of blocks down the street. By their count, they have filed 100 legal actions so far this year against Trump, often with union, nonprofit, or local-government partners.

Since 2021, the group had been operating on the assumption that American democracy was backsliding, and that the outcome of the 2024 election would merely determine whether it sped up or slowed down. By early 2024, it had established working groups with other organizations to begin sketching out the “threat matrix” of a second Trump term, placing particular focus on the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which Trump distanced himself from while campaigning but has largely embraced while in office. “We knew that if the federal landscape were to regress, people would have very few levers of power left,” Skye Perryman, Democracy Forward’s president, told me. “They would be able to go to the streets and to vote, and they would be able to use litigation.”

Democracy Forward’s first filing, to gain access to the deliberations of DOGE, hit the docket of the D.C. district court within hours of Trump taking the oath of office. Eisen’s Democracy Defenders Fund, which has about two dozen attorneys, and three other legal groups filed similar suits at the same time. The decision to sue so soon was controversial. Perryman remembers some elected Democrats, among others, urging her to hold back. But she had been gaming out the moment for more than a year. She had a theory of the case and a coalition that saw the moment as she did. “Right now, it’s fight versus no fight, rather than left or center-left,” she told me.

‘I run the country and the world.’

One week later, the group faced its first crisis. The Office of Management and Budget released a memo telling federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance,” a seismic order that threatened to close hundreds of federally funded programs around the country. “Our litigators knew on the surface: This is unlawful,” Megan Uzzell, Democracy Forward’s director of external affairs, told me. But to build a case, they needed plaintiffs who had been harmed. That night, they worked the phones, signing up an array of groups that received federal funding and needed lawyers, such as the National Council of Nonprofits, the American Public Health Association, and the Main Street Alliance. “We developed that,” Uzzell said. “Our litigators stayed up all night long developing the legal framework, and we were in court by 10 o’clock the next morning.” The memo was stayed by a court that day and withdrawn by the White House the next.

A pattern developed. Attorneys drafted legal arguments for potential moves by Trump, worked the phones to find plaintiffs and dig up facts, and then rushed to court. “It is what the administration didn’t think the legal community would be able to do,” Perryman told me. “This is highly factually intense work. It’s designed that way so that the administration can go in and make a bunch of technical arguments, and we have met them every step of the way.”

Shortly after Trump’s second inauguration, a school-committee member for Easthampton, Massachusetts, received a Facebook Messenger text from an old college friend asking if she would be interested in going to court. Democracy Forward was preparing a lawsuit against Trump to challenge expected cuts to the Department of Education, and they were looking for plaintiffs.

Easthampton is a former mill town in the western part of the state, with a school district of about 1,400 kids and 118 teachers, and a working-class population that is far more politically mixed than much of the broadly liberal area. For the mayor and the school committee, going to court was not an easy decision. The superintendent and the district’s lawyer were initially skeptical. But Sam Hunter, who received the outreach, along with his school-committee colleague Laura Scott, decided to push ahead anyway.

“The conversation was, ‘You are in 1938 Berlin. Which kind of person are you?’” Scott remembered. “This is the closest you are going to get to that moment.” Democracy Forward also signed up the Somerville, Massachusetts, school district, along with a set of public-employee unions. The case eventually merged with a similar lawsuit filed by Democratic state attorneys general.

Weeks later, Hunter found himself in a Boston courtroom listening to the federal judge Myong J. Joun consider Trump’s decision to eliminate about half of the staff at the Department of Education in the name of efficiency. The president had acknowledged that he could not get rid of the department altogether—Trump’s stated goal—without an act of Congress. But his lawyers argued that he had the power to make personnel decisions in the meantime, even if that meant firing half of the employees. The question before the judge was whether the government’s claims made constitutional sense.

Joun, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, had before him a raft of details about Easthampton’s concerns. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which had been targeted for dismantling by Trump, had worked closely with the district to resolve issues of racial bias in how the schools disciplined their students. Their transportation options, class sizes, and accommodations for students with disabilities all depended on federal support.

“Do you drink coffee?” Joun asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton at a hearing, in late April.

“I do,” Hamilton responded for the government.

“I drink coffee every morning,” the judge continued. “I go to Dunkin’ Donuts, and when I walk in, there is a person behind the counter. There is a person making a fresh pot of coffee. If I want a sandwich, there’s a person at the sandwich station … Let’s say one morning there is no one there. I don’t think the plaintiffs are saying that Dunkin’ Donuts should hire these three employees back. I think what they’re saying is they want their cup of coffee.”

At another point in the argument, Joun dismissed the government’s claim that Trump’s order was legal because it said in the text that it would not violate the law, comparing it to a teenager coming up with a nonsensical explanation for breaking a parent’s rules.

Hunter was surprised by the lighthearted tone. It was clear to him that Joun was on the side of the schools. “Every time he made one of those jokes, I would look around and think: Are we all laughing?” Hunter told me.

Joun ruled that Trump’s cuts overstepped his authority, quoting at length from the briefs that Easthampton had filed. “The idea that Defendants’ actions are merely a ‘reorganization’ is plainly not true,” he wrote, issuing a preliminary injunction that prohibited the Department of Education from going through with its planned layoffs. Weeks later, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the ruling, sending it to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“All of our lawsuits tell stories,” Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, which was a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit and 11 others, told me. “But you can’t ask the judge to do all the work. If you want to prevail, you have to put real stories and real harm in front of the judge.”

The Supreme Court’s liberals are trying to tell Americans something

The Supreme Court ultimately voided Joun’s ruling in an order that offered no reasoning. “The majority apparently deems it more important to free the Government from paying employees it had no right to fire than to avert these very real harms while the litigation continues,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by the Court’s two other Democratic appointees. The Department of Education employees were dismissed. But the law remains unsettled. Joun has ordered amended complaints to be filed by October 15, setting up a winter battle that could eventually end up back at the Supreme Court.

Eisen believes that these legal struggles against Trump are just the opening minutes of a much larger battle. “He did not win that round. We did not win either,” he told me, “but we held our own, and that in itself is a victory.”

The Supreme Court, which has so far appeared more favorable to Trump than district courts, could ultimately tilt the scorecard in the president’s favor, as the justices begin to consider the substance of the legal questions presented by Trump. But the ultimate score will not be recorded on just the appellate docket or in the list of injunctions that are left to stand. Organizers are tracking Trump’s approval ratings, as well, anticipating the effect the legal efforts could have on the 2026 midterm elections. “Despite the bluster from the White House, the president has been losing public support. He is losing in court in ways that he did not anticipate,” Perryman told me. Voters have the power to provide the ultimate check.

The president is also providing more fodder for more lawsuits. The many aggressive tactics by ICE have spawned new cases, as has the deployment of federal officers and National Guardsmen to try to crack down on crime in D.C. Eisen is working on a plan for a lawsuit against Trump that challenges the financial benefits he and his family have enjoyed since taking office. The battle, in short, is just beginning.

“The demand for lawyers that are willing to defend people from the government is exponentially greater today than it was on day one,” Perryman told me. “We believe the next 200 days are going to be even more significant than the first 200 days.”

Early in Donald Trump’s second term, as the president was asserting a level of nearly autocratic power — which his predecessors certainly did not think they possessed — I published an essay called “Don’t Believe Him.”

In that essay, I argued that Trump was asserting all this power because he was actually weak. He was moving so fast because everywhere else in the government, he was likely to be stopped — in Congress and in the courts. And so it was very important not to treat what Trump was doing as fixed, as something that could not be undone. Because it was only in assuming he had that power that he would really have it. Otherwise, he was going to get mired down in the same inertia and checks and balances that had mired down all his predecessors.

For a while, that bet looked sort of right. Trump was getting stopped in the courts. They were ruling against him overwhelmingly, over and over again. These were the early months of the administration — we were still then waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in.

But in the last few months, the Supreme Court has weighed in. And it has weighed in overwhelmingly for Donald Trump and the powers he seeks.

I guess the good news here is that maybe we’re not going to have the constitutional showdown many feared. But the bad news is that it’s because Trump is getting what he wants.

Is that because this Supreme Court is submitting to him and afraid of a showdown? Is it because this Supreme Court has wanted this kind of presidency and has in fact, been building the constitutional structure and permission for it for years?

To help me think this through, I wanted to bring back Kate Shaw to the podcast. Shaw is a former Supreme Court clerk. She’s a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and a co-host of the fantastic podcast “Strict Scrutiny.”

Note: This episode was recorded on Aug. 21, before Trump announced his intention to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and before Immigration and Customs Enforcement rearrested Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and began processing him for deportation to Uganda.

Ezra Klein: Kate Shaw, welcome back to the show.

Kate Shaw: Thanks for having me, Ezra.

Earlier this year, shortly after Donald Trump took office, I made the case that Trump was acting like a dictator but didn’t actually have dictatorial power. In a bunch of subsequent episodes, people came on the show and said: Look, the courts are stopping him. The system is sort of working.

The Supreme Court has since weighed in a number of times. Where are we now?

I think things look worse for the rule of law and better for Trump’s dictatorial aspirations now than they did three or four months ago.

So I think it’s right that in the first couple of months of the administration, Trump was making these wildly broad assertions of executive authority and executive orders and other kinds of actions, and he was running into the kind of buzz saw of the lower courts applying settled doctrine, reading the Constitution and statutes, and saying: No, you can’t do that. That’s not how any of this works.

That is still ongoing. But beginning in about April, the Supreme Court started to get into the mix. In a series of rulings — actually 16 in a row — the Supreme Court has sided with Trump and against challenges to Trump and against lower courts that have ruled against Trump, in this wild streak of victories for Trump that have largely happened under the radar because they’re happening on the shadow docket.

Can you say what the shadow docket is?

Sure. People are most familiar with the Supreme Court’s work on what we call the merits docket. Those are cases the court decides it’s going to take. There are briefs filed, oral arguments, and then the court writes and releases written opinions, usually, like the big ones, at the end of June. That’s the merits docket.

The court also does a lot of work on what we call the shadow docket. Some of that is pretty trivial stuff — how much time people are going to get in oral arguments and things like that.

But increasingly, parties have come to the Supreme Court asking for emergency relief, usually because they’ve been ruled against by the lower courts. And the court, often in the dead of night, often without any reasoning or written opinion at all, disposes of these requests for emergency relief.

That’s this kind of streak of victories that Trump has had, ruling after ruling in favor of Trump, allowing him to do a lot of, I think, wildly damaging and destructive things, even though the only written opinion assessing the lawfulness of his conduct has come from the lower courts and has been against him.

Let’s go through a couple of these clusters of asserted powers that I think, at least a couple of months ago, felt very contested.

So the administration launches, DOGE emerges, and they begin firing federal employees en masse in ways that many of us did not think you could fire federal employees. We have these very complex civil service protections, and anybody who has ever been around these processes knows how difficult it is to hire and fire. But they begin doing mass firings, often without real cause.

This gets stopped, challenged in a bunch of lower courts. Where did the Supreme Court come in?

Largely, Trump has prevailed in these efforts. Now the court hasn’t, on the merits, actually grappled with some of these questions. The statutes that provide civil service protections are still on the books, and the Supreme Court has not in any way said those laws are unconstitutional, even though I think it’s pretty clear that Trump and many of his advisers think that’s the case.

In some of those memos or emails that you just referenced, the reason for termination that is given is literally two words: Article II — that the president’s power under Article II entitles him to fire anyone. I do think they think that.

So the court has addressed a number of cases involving these terminations, some of them high-level officials — people like one of the members of the National Labor Relations Board or the Merit Systems Protection Board. Statutes give those officials protection against being fired just because the president feels like it or wants to put somebody else in the position.

Trump, in clear facial violations of those statutes, fired those people. And actually, this case involving the N.L.R.B. and M.S.P.B. members made it to the Supreme Court on the shadow docket, and we did get a short written opinion there that basically said: These officials exercise significant executive authority, and so the president has to be able to fire them at will.

I think that reasoning is wrong, but at least it’s there. So we know the court thinks it will ultimately decide this probably next term but thinks that these heads of multimember agencies, Trump can fire anytime he wants, regardless of what statutes say.

So DOGE and Trump came in and, without going to Congress, decapitated and eviscerated a series of agencies — most famously U.S.A.I.D., the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to some degree, and the Department of Education, to a very large degree.

I remember when Barack Obama wanted to restructure the Commerce Department, and Congress wasn’t interested, so he couldn’t do it.

What has happened there?

Imagine Barack Obama deciding to just abolish by executive order the Commerce Department. Or Joe Biden saying: We’re going to get rid of ICE.

The idea that he would just by fiat fire everyone in these agencies — and that the court would allow it — is kind of preposterous. I don’t think there’s any way that the Supreme Court would have allowed a different president to proceed as this president is proceeding — which isn’t the question you asked, but I do think that that’s worth saying.

Not irrelevant to the questions I have, though.

I think you’re right that Trump has proceeded in a few different ways. Funding cuts are one tool that Trump has used. The Department of Education — first, there’s an executive order saying: Let’s do a wind down. And then there are these directives from the secretary.

And there’s a challenge that says: This is a functional elimination of an agency. Congress passed a statute creating an agency, creating components of the agency, conferring authority and imposing obligations on the officials in these parts of this agency. And only Congress can undo all of that.

The actions taken pursuant to that order were shrouded in this legal cover, like: We’re doing reorgs and trying to make the agency more efficient.

But really, the challenge was that this was a way to dismantle the agency. And that is what the lower courts found was done. This secretary didn’t have the authority to take the steps that she took by statute.

And this is one of the examples of cases in which the court ruled against the lower court, stayed the lower court injunction, but didn’t provide any reasoning. We just don’t know why.

And yet the effect is essentially to make it impossible for the Department of Education to carry out many of its statutorily conferred obligations and functions, like providing a real education for millions of children with disabilities and many other services.

There is this theory called the unitary executive theory. It has been bouncing around for a long time, and it’s sort of what you see the Trump administration asserting. And I think this is what you see the court, in a way, responding to.

What is it? And what is the case for it? If you’re talking to your law students and you’ve got to steel-man unitary executive, what’s the argument you make?

Since the beginning, there has been a debate about what kind of power the president possesses. The first sentence of Article II says: “The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America.”

So what is the executive power? What does it mean for it to be vested in a president? There’s been a debate from the very beginning.

James Madison is associated with the view that all that sentence really means is it should be vested in a president — like there’s going to be one president. Because there has been debate about plural executives. And there’s a name for the office — it’s president. But that sentence doesn’t do that much more.

And then there’s another view that “the executive power shall be vested” actually confers really expansive authority on the president. And maybe that includes some of the powers that the king possessed, especially around things like national security and foreign affairs — so really broad power.

This debate has been essentially around from the beginning. But the unitary executive as a theory of presidential power is really just traceable to the early 1980s and the Reagan Justice Department, which is where the conservative legal movement is born.

And it essentially says the president has expansive authority in a vertical sense — he has the authority to direct everybody in the executive branch, including maybe heads of independent agencies where Congress has tried to insulate those people from the president — but also horizontal power, including powers that Congress is disabled from regulating.

People have lots of different kinds of versions of the unitary executive theory, but I think that’s probably a good distillation: very broad powers, both vertical and horizontal.

Well, I also understand it as encompassing a critique that I don’t fully agree with, but I actually have some sympathy for: The idea that the administrative state — the broad executive branch — is an unaccountable fourth branch of government. And the idea that in Congress, everything is under Congress’s control. But that the public elects the president to lead the executive branch. But when you add up the regulatory language, the statutory language, the civil service protections, the fact that bureaucracies grow on their own and have their own institutional dynamics, the president, in fact, doesn’t lead the executive branch.

And so you need the unitary executive power — this ability to hire and fire, to destroy agencies, to replace whomever you want. Because who is supposed to be in charge of the executive branch, of all these agencies, if not the president? So if the president can’t fire people, then in what way is he actually in charge of it? And if he’s not in charge of it, then haven’t we broken a fundamental mechanism of democratic accountability?

Yes, and I think the response to that is that democratic accountability works in a few different ways. Congress is obviously also democratically accountable, and Congress has made a series of choices that give the president enormous authority over the administrative state — but do provide these pockets where, yes, the president does encounter some friction. Because, actually, there are certain things — financial regulatory bodies and monetary policy are key areas — that for a long time Congress has said: Maybe politics should encounter some resistance, and we should create a degree of independence and insulation in those bodies.

The president can still, of course, hire and fire the top officials in the cabinet departments and in everything that we think of as traditional executive branch agencies. But this cluster of independent agencies — where, by the way, the president does still have a lot of authority: He actually can still fire people, he just has to provide some reasons. He can’t fire them because he wants to put in a co-partisan or a lackey instead. Or maybe he can try because actually there haven’t been very many legal challenges that have tested the meaning of those “for cause” protections. They have operated instead to disincentivize presidents from trying to fire these high-level officials at those kinds of agencies.

Now, of course, we can have policy debates — and of course, you’re having those policy debates about where that friction gets really problematic and thwarts the ability to make policy happen. But the idea that it’s unconstitutional for Congress to provide some of these protections from the president, I think, is not a winning argument.

There have been a lot of cases around the deportation powers and also the lack of due process hearings, etc., around deportation. Where do those stand?

So I would say three categories. First, this group of challenges to individuals sent to CECOT, this Salvadoran prison that Abrego Garcia and a number of others were held in. The administration had something of a mixed set of outcomes in those challenges.

The Supreme Court said these challenges were brought using the wrong procedural device and in the wrong place. But the Supreme Court did confirm that due process is required, even in the context of individuals designated under the Alien Enemies Act.

Stephen Miller touted this as a victory for Trump. I think that most legal commentators viewed it as a mixed result — but a really important reaffirmation of the importance of due process.

I think that’s also true about Abrego Garcia. He also prevailed in a different lower court. The Supreme Court reviewing his case basically confirmed that the lower court didn’t exceed its authority by ordering the administration to facilitate his return. Although they parsed words and said: Lower courts can’t direct the president to effectuate, but they can require facilitation. It’s a little unclear what the difference there is — but again, a mixed outcome, I would say, for the Trump administration. And you’re right: Mr. Abrego Garcia was subsequently — despite the administration’s protest that it just couldn’t — returned to the United States.

The last of these involves the third-country removals. That’s what I’m hard-pressed to really explain. This is a group of individuals who, under a statute that does give the executive branch some authority to send people to countries that are not the country they came from — and not even a country they have some other meaningful tie to — but any other country the administration can find that will agree to take them.

And during their removal proceedings, because these are people who already had orders of removal — but not to this third country, like South Sudan — they never could have made arguments about how they shouldn’t have been sent to South Sudan. And these are folks from various places, including Southeast Asia — no connection to South Sudan, whatsoever.

The lower court carefully finds: We’re going to enjoin the administration from removing these people until there is some process afforded. You have to actually give some kind of notice and opportunity for people to object under guarantees against things like facing torture. And the Supreme Court, with not a word of reasoning, stays that lower court order and allows these third-country removals to go forward.

So the absolute, most obviously unconstitutional thing the Trump administration did upon coming back into office was eliminate birthright citizenship. It got stopped by the courts very quickly, and I think most people saw that as: You can’t walk into office and rewrite the Constitution.

There are lots of things both Democrats and Republicans might like to change in the Constitution. But there’s an amendment process. If you want to go through the amendment process, you are welcome to try.

A court immediately beats Trump back on that — and I think calls it grossly unconstitutional or something very similar. And then the Supreme Court does intervene. How so?

I was wondering what example you were going to give, and I totally agree. This is a Day 1 executive order that is flagrantly unconstitutional. The first sentence of the 14th Amendment confers citizenship on “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”

It has never been seriously questioned that the 14th Amendment means what we have understood it to mean: People born here are citizens, full stop. The Supreme Court, in 1898 and a number of other cases, has confirmed what the text of the Constitution says pretty clearly. And yet on Day 1, he issues an executive order that flies in the face of all of that.

And you’re right, a number of lower courts quickly find the order is facially unconstitutional and enjoin it. And the administration runs to the Supreme Court, as it has in a number of these cases — but interestingly, not asking the court to review the merits of the lower court’s conclusions that the executive order is unconstitutional — but on the question of the scope of relief that these lower courts provided.

So they issued what are known as nationwide injunctions, basically saying: This executive order is unconstitutional, and the administration cannot apply it as such to anyone.

And what the administration came to the Supreme Court asking is for a ruling that those orders, these nationwide injunctions, exceed the scope of judicial authority.

This is a thing that has become very routine. Lower courts responding to actions by Republican and Democratic presidents alike in recent decades have issued these nationwide injunctions. There has been a lot of debate about whether many of them go too far —

Joe Biden’s solicitor general, at the end of Biden’s term, said: You all should look at this. Maybe we shouldn’t be doing this this way anymore.

As a policy matter, there is something democratically troubling about a policy process that results in some action, an executive order or something else that affects everybody. Presumably, the nation has participated in the choice of the person who is making that decision. And a single judge in, say, Amarillo, Texas, can grind that democratic process to a halt. There is something genuinely troubling about that.

So there’s been a serious debate, which I don’t want to downplay, about the constitutional foundations and the policy wisdom of courts’ single unelected judges having this power to grind to a halt an executive action.

Those are all important and fair debates. But I do think that it is telling that the Supreme Court was very uninterested in entertaining those arguments during the Biden administration. And yet, in the face of this executive order that is so clearly and wildly unconstitutional, this is the case in which they decided to take up the question: Do lower courts have this power?

And on the very last day of the Supreme Court term, in an opinion written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court basically said: No, lower courts don’t have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions — it exceeds the scope of their power.

So that’s the world we live in now. Lower courts don’t have this tool — although they do have other tools.

So where does birthright citizenship stand?

Immediately, new lawsuits were filed in lower courts, challenging birthright citizenship, using a different device: class action. So get a group of people, define the people in that class here, people who would be covered by this executive order and were expecting to give birth.

Two lower courts have certified those classes and actually have ruled for them. So right now, there are lower court orders finding — again, using a different legal device — that this order is unconstitutional. And that will likely be back before the Supreme Court before too long.

I want to hold on the question of the nationwide injunction. On the one hand, it is a slightly wild remedy — and there are definitely places where it has been applied where I’ve disagreed. And on the other, if the Supreme Court works slowly — they have still, for instance, not ruled on the birthright citizenship question on its merits.

So if an administration wants to do something blatantly unconstitutional or that violates rights some other way, and the courts cannot stop it from happening nationwide, and it’s not really something you can attack in a class-action lawsuit — which is, I think, a little bit of a weird backdoor to go through — then what?

The courts are meant to be a check on an administration acting fundamentally unlawfully, but it seems like what the Roberts court decided is that they’re not going to be that check in that way.

Also, the executive can move so much faster than the courts — which has always been the thing the Trump administration has been exploiting. And it seems like the Roberts court watched this happening and said: Yes, the executive should just be able to exploit this.

There are a lot of things you can do that, once they’re done, you cannot reverse a year and a half later because the damage is done — the agency is gone, the people are gone, the harms have been committed. Having broken the egg, you can’t put the egg back together.

Right — the bell cannot be unrung. Yes, absolutely. I think the Supreme Court has, again, functionally allowed the administration to do a lot of irreversible damage through this order. This is the case that it decided, having seen what Trump was doing in his first couple of months in office, to essentially allow him to do all of that and more without the real prospect of lower courts acting as the kind of bulwark that they were in the early days of the administration.

Brett Kavanaugh writes a concurrence in which he sort of acknowledges the kind of dynamics that you’re talking about and says: If there are serious problems and something needs an emergency answer that applies nationwide, we, the Supreme Court, are in a position to step in and save that.

Oh, so they get discretion to do it.

Yes, exactly. They don’t even really explain why lower courts exceed their judicial authority if they issue these injunctions. But the Supreme Court can do it. I mean, there’s this weird passage in the opinion where Barrett says: We can speak, and everyone will listen.

And what she cites as support for that is a concession made by Trump’s solicitor general at the oral argument — like: We’ll listen to you if you tell us we can’t do something.

And it just feels just wildly debasing or something to say: We have all this power. And the thing that makes me know we have this power is that you’ve said you’ll listen to us. Not because you have to, but because you’ve decided out of discretion to tell us you will.

It’s a really strange passage, but that’s where we are.

Well, let’s say that, like me, you don’t quite buy into the idea that the Supreme Court applies politically neutral reasoning in all cases and is free from any partisan impulses or politics.

So you imagine: Well, all these new powers and new possibilities are being unlocked, and maybe the next Democratic president is going to want to use them. So maybe a Democratic version of what we’re looking at with the birthright citizenship case is: Maybe six months before an election, Democrats decide to pass a bill that regulates campaign spending in a way that would not be allowed under Citizens United or Buckley v. Valeo — the kind of strong campaign finance reform that many of us wish would pass.

And of course, maybe it won’t survive all the challenges, but — in a year when, say, Elon Musk is trying to spend $600 million to buy the election — the Supreme Court doesn’t move that fast, and Trump just showed that you get this kind of clock in which you can do anything.

So the Supreme Court, what it is saying is — it’s not saying that a Democrat can’t use that power. But the way I interpret what you just said is that a Democratic president can probably not use the muzzle velocity strategy of the Trump administration. Because the Supreme Court has reserved for itself in cases when it is aroused.

Absolutely. I’ll say a couple of things. One, the court says we can move quickly when we want to move quickly. John Roberts is proud of this.

They moved in a matter of weeks when the Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Trump from appearing on the Colorado ballot. They needed to get that decision out before Super Tuesday, and they did.

The TikTok ban they resolved in a matter of days.

They moved on Abrego Garcia fairly quickly.

Yes, they did. That’s true.

But then they can slow-walk when they want to. They slow-walked Trump’s challenge to Jack Smith’s actual indictment of Trump — even though Smith tried to fast-track that so we’d have an answer to whether he could stand trial well before the election. So I think it’s right that they can manipulate timing. Absolutely.

There’s also a substantive asymmetry — which is that it’s easier to move at muzzle velocity to break than to build.

If we’re thinking about a Democratic president, Democratic presidents like to build things. And I think it’s harder to do that by fiat without Congress. Not impossible — but it’s differently challenging than it is to break.

Although there may be some things next time that they’re going to want to break. Think about the ICE buildup and the construction of what certainly appears to me to be something becoming very close to a paramilitary force.

You could imagine the next Democratic president coming in and saying: I want this gone. This is out of control.

And it would seem under these powers that they don’t have to wait for Congress.

I agree with that. I would not rule out John Roberts and the other five trying to find a way to distinguish the Department of Education and U.S.A.I.D. from ICE.

But I think that on the law, a Democratic president would be squarely within the precedent set by the Supreme Court to do exactly what he has done, but with different agencies.

To back out for a minute: Think back to the Obama administration or Joe Biden. What power did they and their lawyers not think they had? What did they not think they could do that the Supreme Court has basically said you can do?

I mean, I think refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress. Remove heads of independent agencies protected by statute from summary firing. Fire civil servants without cause. Dismantle federal agencies. Call up the National Guard on the thinnest of pretexts. That’s a preliminary half-dozen powers.

Fundamentally, they didn’t think they had the power to disregard statutes passed by Congress and the text of the Constitution. And I don’t want to fetishize text — but also, just the practices under the Constitution.

They didn’t think they had the power to do things like treat the presidency as an office that permits its occupant to use the power of the state to reward friends and punish enemies and engage in self-dealing and enrichment. Those are not constitutional principles that are written down — they’re really about practices. And those administrations didn’t exercise those powers, but I don’t think they wanted to. I’m not sure any modern president has wanted to exercise these powers.

So that is a preliminary list, but I think it’s a long one.

Something I see in the Roberts court is an insistence on treating political actors, typically Republican political actors, with a level of generosity that requires ignoring huge amounts of things that they have said, done, written. So you end up with these two political systems: the one that is happening and the one that exists in legal filings to John Roberts.

You saw this, in a way, in Trump’s first term, as well, with the Muslim ban, where Trump and people around him had said extremely clearly what this was and why it was being done — and then they came up with a somewhat different legal rationale.

Roberts has this tendency to say: Ignore what’s in front of you, ignore what you’re being told, ignore what Trump’s appointees are saying on Fox News or in public — they say to us that there’s a national security rationale, and we have to assume that if the executive says there’s a national security rationale, there is. And this is an executive operating in good faith, attempting to carry out the laws and the Constitution as we understand them.

Question mark? [Laughs.]

Question mark, I guess. [Laughs.]

Yes, so Trump v. Hawaii — you have Trump on the campaign trail, and then doubling down once he’s inaugurated, basically saying: We’re going to institute a Muslim ban. Like, that’s what he was doing.

And yes, the court does describe some of the really virulently anti-Muslim statements that led up to the enactment of the ban. But then the court just credulously says: Well, this is basically a normal president behaving normally. He has said that there are these vetting deficiencies, and while presidents should do a better job of speaking on the most noble parts of our Constitution and our traditions, we’re not going to invalidate on the basis of these statements this proclamation issued by the president following regular order.

So you’re right — I think that the presumption of good faith and regularity is very much on display.

I will say, in the first Trump term, there were two cases in which that presumption of good faith actually didn’t carry the day. So Roberts writes an opinion, invalidating the effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. He also invalidates the effort to rescind the DACA program administratively. Both were basically because the administration either lied or didn’t really fully consider the implications of the courses of action that it was taking.

So those actually were important losses for Trump. And I’m not sure where John Roberts is right now.

This seems to me to get to the shadow docket problem. Because one thing that I read the Supreme Court doing is functionally chastising a lot of lower courts and saying: You’ve gotten ahead of yourselves. You are issuing these sweeping rulings based on these reads of what you think the Trump administration is doing or is going to do, and you are not giving the executive enough deference.

It’s very hard for me to see what this court has done and not feel like John Roberts and his Republican colleagues feel that the big threat that they’ve really had to step in to intercede on is not the executive branch overreaching but the judicial branch overreaching.

Yes.

They seem much more concerned about lower courts stopping Donald Trump from doing things that are, again, facially unconstitutional or illegal, than about Donald Trump doing things that are unconstitutional or illegal.

It has just struck me as a strange priority set.

I agree. And it’s especially hard to justify what they have communicated — and I think you’re right about what they’re communicating about the lower courts. If you’ve actually followed the proceedings in any of these cases, these are judges who really are trying very hard to accommodate and defer where appropriate to the executive branch.

Many of them are Republican-appointed judges.

Every president, including first-term President Trump, has appointed judges who have ruled against Trump in all kinds of cases — I think it’s over 100 lower court rulings against the Trump administration — appointed by presidents of both parties, essentially in district courts in every circuit in the country.

So this is not like Obama and Biden appointees trying to thwart the policy priorities of the Trump administration. That’s just not remotely a fair characterization of what the lower courts are doing. They’re just doing their jobs.

And I have to imagine that they are pretty incensed by the way that the Supreme Court seems to be treating them — again, just trying to do their best to resolve the disputes that come before them.

The administration is violating the law. It’s kind of that simple.

It just has this quality, to me, of weaponized naïveté.

Yes.

I mean, there’s a famous Federalist Paper that says: If men were angels, we wouldn’t need all this government. And I read the Supreme Court as saying repeatedly: Let’s first assume Donald Trump is an angel, and then let’s work from there.

Yes.

When we were doing episodes on this a couple of months ago, one of the big concerns was a constitutional crisis. The Supreme Court saying: You have to do X. The Trump administration saying: Make us. And then who knows where we are.

One explanation I’ve heard from some people, more positively toward John Roberts, is that he is trying to avoid that scenario. Partially, everything is on the shadow docket because we’re not really seeing him upend all this precedent.

We’re seeing him back down from a fight — and maybe in some way cowardice is the better part of valor here. Do you buy that?

I can’t rule it out as a possibility. Now what exactly he’s keeping his powder dry for, I don’t know.

The Democratic president. [Laughs.]

[Laughs.] Exactly. Maybe that’s right.

I do think that conserving institutional capital is one explanation. They are handing him this series of wins that they don’t think are big, broad wins, and they’re continuing to be heeded — Abrego Garcia did come back, individuals at CECOT were sent to Venezuela. They have not been defied. So maybe it has worked in some fashion.

But we have to also consider the possibility that John Roberts, who has always had a very expansive conception of executive power and is on board with a lot of the substantive policy priorities of the Trump administration, is actually just fine with what we are seeing emanate from the executive branch and from the White House.

I thought he cared enough, honestly, about the basic structures of our constitutional democracy that he would not want to co-sign its destruction. I’m not sure there’s that much evidence of that right now. But it’s early.

You do see these two visions of John Roberts at war with each other in legal commentary.

There’s one of Roberts as the court’s moderate institutionalist figure. Somebody whose primary concern is maintaining the court’s independence, its credibility, its strength. Somebody who seemed to want to be in the middle of the Dobbs decision and on different things has not gone all the way to the right.

Then there’s this other vision of him. In a recent piece for The Atlantic, the N.Y.U. law professor Peter Shane argued that Trump is just executing the presidency that John Roberts has built over not a series of shadow docket rulings but a series of huge rulings that he authored — rulings on immunity, rulings on the Voting Rights Act, rulings on the Muslim ban in Trump’s first term. And that John Roberts has been building the structure of this quasi-dictatorial executive for some time now, and Trump is just stepping into the office that Roberts has designed for him.

So, going backward, what are the rulings that maybe fit that pattern? And how much do you buy that idea?

There is a lot to that theory of what is driving John Roberts. I think that you’re right about the two different John Roberts. We are basically 20 years to the day almost that John Roberts was nominated to be the chief justice.

He joins the court in ’05, and in ’06 and ’07 you see some breadcrumbs. Roberts is skeptical of limits on money in elections under the First Amendment — and those breadcrumbs that Roberts dropped then come to fruition in Citizens United.

The Shelby County case, in 2013, strikes down the part of the preclearance regime of the Voting Rights Act that required the states in the former Confederacy to get the federal government to sign off before they changed anything with respect to their voting practices.

That’s a 2013 opinion that Roberts writes, but actually there are seeds of that in his earlier writings in a 2009 case, also expressing some doubts about the Voting Rights Act. And you can trace those doubts all the way back to his time as a young Reagan Justice Department staffer. He has been skeptical of the Voting Rights Act for a long time.

He authors the immunity decision that is, I think, a wildly wrong decision handing expansive immunity to ex-presidents for basically everything they do while president within their official capacities.

But that is an opinion that is very hard to square with another opinion that he wrote in this case, Trump v. Vance, where Trump was trying to get out of responding to a subpoena from the Manhattan D.A., who had actually subpoenaed financial institutions holding his records. Roberts, in that 2020 opinion, writes in pretty sweeping terms about how presidents are not kings.

So those are two different John Roberts. I can’t at all, as I sit here, square him having seen Trump in office once and deciding it’s really important for us to hold the line on presidents not being kings — and then him deciding at the outset, before Trump was even returning to office, to allow presidents to essentially function as kings, and then also announcing that federal courts can’t intervene in partisan gerrymandering, which is another Roberts opinion.

So you have to pull a lot of threads together. But I do think that expansive authority for both the Supreme Court and the president and limited authority for all other actors, agencies, lower courts and Congress is as good of a distillation of Roberts’ philosophy as I could offer 20 years in.

I want to zone in on the gerrymandering cases for a minute.

We’re having this showdown right now where Trump has pushed Texas and possibly other red states to do very aggressive partisan gerrymandering. We may see California and maybe some other blue states trying to counter it.

But this is the world John Roberts built for us: What Trump is doing is what John Roberts allowed him to do. What Texas is doing is what John Roberts allowed them to do.

Tell me a bit about that case.

Sure. So that’s Rucho v. Common Cause, a case in which the Supreme Court — after equivocating over a number of years and decades about what kinds of limits the Constitution places on the ability to engage in extreme partisan gerrymanders — said definitively: The Constitution has nothing to say about this.

And it is kind of rich having taken this very active role in striking down a lot of what Congress has done with respect to trying to regulate money in elections and a very active role in striking down part of, and maybe more to come, of the Voting Rights Act.

So the court is very active in really creating the terms in which our democracy is waged. And then when it comes to these challenges to partisan gerrymanders, there are very clear arguments that there have to be some limits in the ability of a party in power to further entrench itself in power. The question has always been: Well, what exactly are the limits that courts could announce and then enforce?

And in this Rucho case, the court says: No, there are no judicially discernible or manageable standards. Essentially, gerrymandering just needs to be resolved in the political process, which is not going to happen because by definition —

It needs to be electorally resolved now that you have distorted the elections.

Yes, totally. And the court does say maybe state courts resolving challenges to gerrymanders under state constitutions could be a solution — or independent redistricting commissions. And, of course, some states have taken that up.

But I think if federal courts are supposed to do anything, it really should be to make sure that the mechanisms of democracy work so that federal courts can get out of the way and really just let the people and their choices run the show. And the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene here makes all that very, very difficult.

What can Trump do now? We are so early in the second term. But as these powers seem to expand — and if you’re Stephen Miller or Russ Vought sitting in the White House and you see the kind of record you’re racking up at the Supreme Court — what seems like it’s on the table in terms of executive aggression that, if I had asked you five or six months ago, you would have said is not really on the table?

I suppose they could try more seriously to remove federal judges. There are articles of impeachment that they’ve introduced against a couple of district judges who have ruled against them. Those haven’t gone anywhere.

They could try to undertake a serious effort to actually target the judiciary in a different way. I think anything is on the table in terms of the midterm elections. Future elections are probably what I would identify.

I’ve heard the scholar Kim Lane Scheppele say this a few times: The best way to understand if you’re still in a democracy is not the last election but the next one. What does the next election look like?

And so I do think the midterm elections will be really important. And honestly, I would say that six months ago, I don’t think that a third-term-seeking Trump would have been on the table. The 22nd Amendment is, if anything, even clearer than the first sentence of the 14th Amendment: He cannot run for or serve a third term.

Yet I don’t think he’s joking when he talks about doing it.

You think it’s possible?

Yes, I do.

I’ve sort of pushed it into the not-possible category.

I wouldn’t rule anything out. How the Supreme Court would get around the clear text of the 22nd Amendment, I don’t know. But I thought Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was actually pretty clear, too.

So we can have the Obama-Trump showdown that all American politics has been leading to for so long? It’s the true “Avengers: Endgame” of American politics.

Only Trump can run again, actually. [Laughs.] It’s only nonconsecutive terms.

The Republican House member who introduced legislation to try to make this possible did try to keep Obama out. [Laughs.]

I don’t love voicing this, Ezra, but I don’t think we can rule it out.

The election piece is the really dangerous piece. You look at the redistricting effort right now. That is what democratic backsliding is.

These are people who have been arrested trying to be there at ICE raids — or press conferences, in Padilla’s case.

Yes, Democratic officials — the opposition party’s elected officials being arrested. Trump having his goons target Letitia James, the attorney general of New York. And now it seems like there’s some targeting of a Democratic appointee to the Federal Reserve, Lisa Cook, based on some mortgage issue that they’re claiming needs to be looked into. Adam Schiff, as well.

That’s targeting the political opposition for the substance of their views. I don’t think they will announce that they’re targeting critics because they have criticized. I think they will manufacture some justification — mortgage fraud or whatever. But I think that is something we absolutely have to view as within the realm of the possible.

Whatever John Roberts wants in his self-conception, I think it’s fair to say he doesn’t imagine himself to be the handmaiden of the death of American democracy.

So what is your steel-man version of Roberts? What would he say listening to this podcast about how we’re just hysterical liberals?

He was forged in the cauldron of the early conservative legal movement in the 1980s and the Reagan Justice Department. And they all thought the Warren Court had gone too far, that it had made up rights the Constitution doesn’t confer — and that his court is offering a necessary corrective with respect to how we understand the Constitution, and that it’s also reallocating power.

I think he does think that the right reading of the Constitution is one that gives the president really expansive authority.

I think it’s a pretty ahistorical and incorrect reading of the nature of the presidency and how it was designed as an office. But I do think that he holds the view that the president possesses enormous power and it is up to the court to properly protect the exercise of that power against whatever threats might exist — whether those are lower courts or independent agencies, or even Congress. Again, I think that’s wrong, but I do think that those are genuinely held views.

It is possible that he understands that Trump will make increasingly aggressive assertions of power and maybe the court will be able to stop him and be heeded if it has built up enough institutional capital with the right people in the early days of the Trump administration. I don’t really think that the evidence supports that thesis as much as it does others, but I can’t rule it out.

I also think people are scared of crossing Donald Trump. I don’t know that John Roberts is, but I also don’t know that’s not at all a factor — that people don’t want to be the target of his ire on social media and elsewhere, and that staying in his good graces is something that John Roberts thinks is in his own interest — but also long-term in the institutional interest of the Supreme Court.

How much do you understand what is happening here as simple partisanship?

There are six members of the Supreme Court who are, to a greater or lesser degree, highly oriented toward Donald Trump. You have Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, who, if they could be out there in a MAGA hat, functionally would be. Roberts, like a lot of Republicans, probably has mixed feelings but has moved closer to Trump rather than farther over the years.

How much is all this talking about statute and unitary executive theory just politics by a slightly more complex set of textual argumentation?

The answer is probably different if you’re asking about Alito or Thomas, for whom I think this really is just partisanship.

I think with the others, it is more mixed. They are genuinely committed to a substantive division of both the presidency and the nation that aligns reasonably well with Trump’s.

I don’t assume they have a lot of personal affection for Donald Trump. I actually think for Roberts, he probably doesn’t — although I don’t know that.

But I have long resisted — and I’m finding it harder to resist — really reductive, partisan explanations for their conduct — in particular, all they have done to shore up his presidency in the dark of night, where they are not going to be held accountable by the public for doing it.

I think there is a lot of additional evidence that they really just are partisan justices in support of Donald Trump.

It gets to a broader question that I’ve been struggling with for many years, in many ways, going back before Trump. But it feels like it is getting worse and worse and more and more serious — which is that we just don’t seem to be in a functioning constitutional system.

You go back to the framing of all this, and there’s an expectation that these branches will check each other — that Congress will jealously guard its prerogatives, the executive and the courts. But what you end up having is a Republican court that seems to not want to guard against executive overreach. You have a Republican Congress that has become completely quiescent. And even when it is not a Republican Congress — this is true when it’s a Democrat in power too because of the filibuster and other things — Congress in general is not able to act as a full branch.

We’ve known for many decades that we have an expanding amount of executive power, but we just seem to have been pushed into breakdown. Congress is fine with it because it’s Republicans who are cowed by Trump. And now you have John Roberts basically saying it’s not the court’s job to step in to stop an out-of-control executive.

I don’t know what to call that except a breakdown. I’m curious if you think that’s either too alarmist or wrong on the facts somehow.

No, I don’t. I think that constitutional breakdown, constitutional collapse — I don’t think that it’s irreparable. I don’t think we are beyond some point of no return. But I don’t think our constitutional order is functioning properly at the moment, and I think the Supreme Court bears a lot of responsibility.

What would it look like to try to fix any of this?

There is a divide among legal scholars between reforming the Supreme Court or just radically disempowering the Supreme Court, and I have sympathy for both positions. But I actually think that any kind of court reform has to be paired with meaningful democratic reform. Court reform itself won’t actually get us very far.

So things like eliminating the filibuster, D.C. statehood, maybe expanding the size of the House, actually meaningful voting rights legislation that will do things like end gerrymandering and restore much of what the court has already dismantled — and may be further poised to dismantle — of the Voting Rights Act.

I think that all those things are important. And I also think really limiting the powers of the president — some by statute and maybe some by constitutional amendment — because so much of the presidency has been governed by norms and not hard law.

Big democracy reform, of which court reform is a part, would have to be at the top of the agenda for any future Democratic president.

The fundamental deformity of our entire system is it doesn’t take parties seriously. This is a problem in a lot of the Supreme Court rulings. They say there is a remedy, and that remedy is called impeachment.

And it’s true that impeachment exists. But it’s also true that we functionally know impeachment is now impossible. And that has been true for some time.

If you wanted to do anything, I think you’d have to come to the view that parties are part of the constitutional system. They’re part of our political system. They’re fundamental institutions. And maybe they need to be balanced — Buttigieg talked about this at one point. You can imagine a court that just balanced parties, and so it would have that credibility.

But in this world, you have a system that was never designed for parties, that we know is deformed by parties, and we’re just going to wait until one party or the other truly breaks it.

[Laughs.] It’s a crazy risk we’re running.

I think it is absolutely right that there are a number of really profound flaws in our constitutional design, and one of them is just the failure of the framers to account for the virtually simultaneous rise of parties with the ratification of the Constitution.

The rise of parties happens almost immediately, and nothing in the document accounts for it — nor have any of our amendment efforts since then done anything to meaningfully reflect that reality back.

The co-partisanship across the executive branch and the legislative branch overtaking institutional self-interest obviously very much predates Trump. But the current fever pitch has everything to do with Trump.

And I do think the question is: Is this the new normal or not?

Always our final question: What are three books you’d recommend to the audience?

Since we were talking about whether these justices are really just partisans in robes, I have to recommend my podcast co-host Leah Litman’s book “Lawless,” which is a very accessible and pretty scathing indictment of the Roberts court — and a full-throated defense of the thesis that the Republican justices, as she calls them, are just partisans in robes. So I recommend that one.

I was on vacation recently and read Gary Shteyngart‘s new novel, “Vera, or Faith,” which is a fun near-future dystopia but has a constitutional amendment story line.

You must have been thrilled.

I really was. I was not expecting it. It’s dark but really, really smart. So I recommend that.

And on the topic of constitutional amendments, I’m reading a galley of Jill Lepore’s — the brilliant Harvard historian. Her new book, “We the People,” is about constitutional amendment.

If we think that the lack of anticipation of parties in the Constitution is one real design flaw, another one is that Article V, the way you amend the Constitution, is just way, way too hard.

That’s related to polarization, obviously. But it’s very hard to amend the Constitution today because of supermajorities in both houses, supermajority ratification in the states. But having lost the habit of constitutional amendment in muscle memory is just enormously problematic, and an unamendable document is not one we can continue to be governed by.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/02/opinion/02eks-shaw-image/02eks-shaw-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 13:57:18.164145

ET: This article was updated with remarks from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.","Judge Charles Breyer ruled Tuesday that President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles over the summer is illegal and ""violated"" a nearly 150-year-old federal law.

Newsweek reached out to the White House and the U.S. Department of Defense via email for comment.

Why It Matters

The ruling comes as contention builds nationally around the conversation of crime, illegal immigration and the federal government's willingness to deploy and use the National Guard in places including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., with cities like Chicago also being threatened.

California Governor Gavin Newsom is deploying state police officers to places like San Francisco, which Trump previously mentioned as a possible future deployment area for federal troops.

Up to 1,700 National Guard troops could soon be deployed in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming to aid with ICE efforts, Fox News reported last week, citing documents and unnamed Pentagon officials.

The Trump administration reportedly stated that such efforts have no relation to the ongoing crime crackdown in the nation's capital.

What To Know

Breyer's ruling on Tuesday in the Northern District of California, granting an injunction, cites Congress's passage of the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878, which prohibits the use of the U.S. military to execute domestic law. In June, the judge oversaw a three-day trial in a case brought about by Newsom challenging Trump's use of Title 10 to deploy troops to Los Angeles.

""Nearly 140 years later, Defendants—President Trump, Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth, and the Department of Defense—deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to quell a rebellion and ensure that federal immigration law was enforced,"" Breyer wrote.

""There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence. Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.""

Breyer also wrote in the 52-page ruling that nearly three months after National Guard troops were first deployed to Los Angeles, 300 National Guard members remain stationed there.

""Moreover, President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country—including Oakland and San Francisco, here in the Northern District of California—thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,"" he said.

Last week, Newsom announced that he dispatched California Highway Patrol ""crime suppression teams"" to multiple major regions, including Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, the Inland Empire and the Central Valley, as his administration contrasted the state-led deployments with Trump's unilateral use of federal forces in U.S. cities.

Who Is Judge Charles Breyer?

Breyer, 83, is a senior U.S. district judge for the Northern District of California. From 2018 to 2022, he served as chairman of the United States Sentencing Commission.

Breyer was an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force from August 1973 to November 1974, prior to entering private practice in San Francisco from 1974 to 1997. He briefly served as chief assistant district attorney of the City and County of San Francisco in 1979.

On July 24, 1997, President Bill Clinton nominated Breyer for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on November 8, 1997.

Appeals Could Reach U.S. Supreme Court

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek that the ruling was somewhat unexpected, considering that a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit had previously overruled Breyer and said that Trump lawfully federalized the California National Guard under a different statute, Title 10, rather than the 10 U.S.C. § 12406 statute.

""[Breyer's] trying to pigeonhole it through a different statute,"" Rahmani said. ""Historically, presidents have a lot of leeway when it comes to law enforcement; the executive branch [does] in general. In this particular case, Trump relied on a different statute...I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up in the Supreme Court. It's a pretty important issue.""

Trump's ambitions to deploy troops to other states could still take place while any appeals for a stay could be filed by the Department of Justice, Rahmani added.

""You can very well have judges that have completely different rulings in different states, in which case you'd have these circuit splits and the Supreme Court would have to weigh in,"" he said.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump, Tuesday on Truth Social: ""At least 54 people were shot in Chicago over the weekend, 8 people were killed...Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, & soon. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

California Governor Gavin Newsom, Tuesday on X: ""The ruling is clear: Trump is breaking the law by trying to create a national police force with himself as its chief.""

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on X: ""I applaud the court for today's important ruling. The White House tried to invade the second largest city in the country. That's illegal. Los Angeles will not buckle and we will not break. We will not be divided and we will not be defeated.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said before signing an executive order on Saturday: ""We may see militarized immigration enforcement. We may also see National Guard troops. We may even see active duty military and armed vehicles in our streets. We have not called for this. Our people have not asked for this, but nevertheless, we find ourselves having to respond to this.""

What Happens Next

Breyer froze the injunction until noon on September 12, which could provide the Trump administration with time to challenge the ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

""It seems ORR's mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they're not an immigration enforcement entity.""","McALLEN, Texas -- President Donald Trump's administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration's struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors - usually a parent or guardian - are properly vetted.

The memo said sponsors must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says ""federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.""

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a ""built-in opportunity"" to arrest parents - something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. ""As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,"" Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don't already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates ""clearly and proactively"" with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won't influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

""The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,"" it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

""We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,"" she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden's administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden's administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don't understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

""If we don't understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?"" said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

""It seems like it's designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,"" she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

""The agency's mission has been conflated and entangled,"" she added. ""It seems ORR's mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they're not an immigration enforcement entity.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15837093_012525-wls-ice-file-clean-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-02 12:00:09.774071

They threatened to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn’t comply.","With a report suggesting the federal government may be preparing a surge of immigration enforcement in the Boston area, Gov. Maura Healey and Mayor Michelle Wu are speaking out.

The pair on Monday both addressed a Politico report on Friday saying the Trump administration is preparing ""an immigration enforcement blitz"" in Boston in the coming weeks. The report cited unnamed current and former administration sources, and NBC News has yet to confirm it.

But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked about the report on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, and did not deny she was planning an expansion to other cities, including Boston.

""I think there's a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now and so we haven't taken anything off the table,"" she said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not responded to requests for comment from NBC10 Boston.

Asked about the report Monday, at the city's first Labor Day Parade, Wu elaborated on a statement she released about earlier in the weekend.

“Groceries are becoming more expensive, housing is harder to build, and all of this connected to a federal administration that is targeting the very people who built our country and our cities,"" the mayor said.

Healey said the president should be sending funding, not troops: ""I think it's disrespectful to local and state law enforcement, who work hard every day. And what we need from the Trump administration is funding for cops, funding for community policing, funding for law enforcement.""

Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, has previously vowed to “flood the zone in Boston” with federal immigration enforcement.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration came to a head earlier this month when the Justice Department sent letters to Boston and other sanctuary jurisdictions demanding they end the immigration protections. They threatened to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn’t comply.

In response, Wu held a press conference with local leaders where she called on Trump to ""stop attacking our cities.""

""We will not back down,"" she said. ""This is not the first time I've made it clear that our residents expect us to take care of our city. We know how to take care of our neighbors here in Boston without the interference, coersion, intimidation, bullying or threats from the federal government.""

Two federal law enforcement officials told NBC News earlier this week that multiple federal agencies, including ICE and Border Patrol, will soon ""surge manpower"" to Chicago to increase arrests of undocumented immigrants, and that similar operations were planned in other so-called “sanctuary cities.”

Healey has called the use of national guards to supplement immigration enforcement ""political theater"" that ""does nothing to improve public safety,"" On Thursday, she joined the nation's other Democratic governors in a statement calling for an end to the president's attempts to deploy states' national guards.

""Every American deserves to feel safe in their neighborhood and community. But instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicize our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of Governors as Commanders in Chief of their state’s National Guard,"" the 19 governors wrote.

They called deploying the National Guard without its governor's consent ""an alarming abuse of power"" and ""chaotic federal interference.""",https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/03/boston-sunrise-generic.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C624px%2C5976px%2C3362px&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-02 12:57:50.897060

Now that fig leaf has been stripped away, leaving only the shocking reality of a disregard for human rights, human safety and human dignity.

The government was quick to condemn this weekend’s marches, to call for calm and unity, and to bolster its perceived image as an administration for all Australians. But again, this offered only a brief respite from its own inhumane choices.

Actions speak far louder than words, and this government’s actions are telling us all we need to know.

They are telling us that this will not end with a certain cohort of people. There is no line in the sand, no depths to which this government will not sink. This is not hyperbole. This is proven reality.

They are telling us that the safety of those who have fled unimaginable danger in the search of a new home, a new community, a new start can no longer rely on the cornerstones of fairness, justice and equity.

They are telling us that, while they spin lines about multiculturalism and cohesion, with these laws they are willing to bend a knee to the worst of the toxic and hate-filled tendencies this country can possibly demonstrate.

They are telling us that the bedrock of our country – that our laws and rules apply equally, no matter where you were born – has collapsed beneath us.

We must not watch in shock and sadness. We must fight for human rights. Not just for those in the firing line of these policies. But for the Australia we wish to see.

An Australia where people like me can arrive as an unaccompanied minor, orphaned by war and having grown up in a Ugandan refugee camp, and rise to contribute to my adopted home.

Where the neighbours, church, teachers and community members who supported and welcomed me and many others are treated as the example, not the exception.

Where a fair go applies to all.

It is clear that a vote for such values does not deliver them. We must stand up for human rights, and make clear enough is enough. Together, we can turn the tide towards a true compassionate nation.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74956100833fd78f656145c96bcb7a320150d38f/78_0_5078_4063/master/5078.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4244dfb68208a64427db4cedea748950",N,,2025-09-02 10:56:30.252972

Conversely, Senator Cory Booker and New York lawmakers propose the VISIBLE Act, requiring ICE agents to remove masks and wear clear identification.","The digital battlefield in America’s immigration enforcement landscape is escalating. In mid‑2025, Netherlands‑based activist Dominick Skinner launched ICE List to publish names, social media links, and photos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

Skinner called it an “accountability project.” In a few short months, the platform has swelled from about 50 profiles to over 200 ICE personnel exposed. Thousands of tips pour in daily, often from anonymous sources or insiders, fueling rapid expansion.

Skinner isn’t alone. Inspired individuals and networks across the country have embraced grassroots tools. Sherman Austin, a California engineer, raised nearly $25,000 for Stop ICE Raids Alerts, which turns user-submitted photos or videos into instant text updates. “Ice agents appear to be staying at a Four Points Sheraton in Rancho Cucamonga,” read one.

The messages sparked immediate calls to “make noise,” or “no sleep for ICE.” Meanwhile, Boston’s LUCE Immigrant Justice Network fields tips on Nextdoor and dispatches volunteers to assist undocumented individuals or document enforcement activity.

Federal authorities have taken notice. Attorney General Pam Bondi warned the creator of ICEBlock, an app that maps sightings of ICE agents, to “watch out,” alleging it broadcasts law enforcement locations to criminals. In retaliation, website hosting for ICE List was dropped by Bluehost after two weeks. Skinner relaunches his site every time it goes offline.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s deportation machinery is surging. TRAC data shows that as of July 27, ICE held nearly 57,000 people in detention. A striking 71 percent of them had no criminal conviction. The use of ankle monitors, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C., is rising, part of a broader shift toward tighter surveillance.

At the same time, ICE’s own use of AI is ramping up. A new $30 million deal with Palantir is supposed to deliver prototype software called ImmigrationOS this month, intended to help ICE identify, track, and deport individuals. The system continues through 2027, raising deep concerns about due process and surveillance reach.

According to Amnesty International, through Palantir’s ImmigrationOS and Babel Street’s Babel X, ICE is deploying AI to monitor migrants, especially under programs like “Catch and Revoke,” which revokes visas based on social media and other data cues.

Such tools synthesize data from government and private sources to assign threat assessments and sentiment scores, particularly targeting international students and marginalized communities.

As both sides saturate the digital and real-world environments with surveillance tools and countermeasures, activists have now turned AI against ICE agents themselves.

Skinner’s ICE List project uses machine learning to reconstruct masked faces in footage if 35 percent or more of a face is visible, and volunteers cross-check resulting synthetic images via reverse image search tools like PimEyes to identify agents.

Of these AI-enabled identifications, Skinner acknowledges roughly 60 percent are incorrect, but believes “public accountability” overshadow concerns over errors or risk.

ICE officials claim masking is essential for agent safety, citing threats from transnational gangs and mounting assaults. Agents have taken to wearing masks and adopting countersurveillance tactics after learning that their identities may be exposed during raids.

One Boston‑based official said protesters yelled warnings to immigrants and even slashed a tire during a courthouse arrest, forcing agents to abandon a pending operation.

The neuroscience of technology and anonymity is fueling legislation. Senator Marsha Blackburn introduced the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act which aims to criminalize publishing a federal officer’s name with intent to obstruct enforcement.

Conversely, Senator Cory Booker and New York lawmakers propose the VISIBLE Act, requiring ICE agents to remove masks and wear clear identification. Critics of masking legislation argue it may compromise investigations, especially against undercover operations or transnational crime threats.

Ultimately, this digital clash pits two forces: ICE’s increasing reliance on AI-driven surveillance for enforcement, including Palantir’s data integration and Babel X’s sentiment scanning, and activists wielding the same tools to identify agents, map operations, and broadcast their presence.

On one hand, the government’s deportation strategy has grown to unprecedented levels. In July alone, deportation flights reached a record high of 1,214, many cloaked with dummy call signs or hidden tail numbers. Activists compensating by setting up tarmac cameras and open-source tracking represent a broader pushback against opaque federal actions.

On the other hand, while agencies train and equip under secrecy, activists frame exposure and transparency as the only recourse for oppressed populations. The ICE List, Stop ICE Alerts, ICEBlock, ICE Tea Watch, and related campaigns present themselves as defenders of human rights; ICE decries them as hazards to officer safety and effective law enforcement.

Courts and Congress have yet to catch up, offering only partial protections or modest bills.

The broader question now is not just about ethics or legality, but about the future of surveillance and resistance. If both sides can be tracked, mapped, and unmasked, what does accountability look like? While ICE increases its grip using AI platforms like ImmigrationOS, activists turn that same tech into a tool for citizen oversight.

WATCH: Retired major general calls Trump’s National Guard plans ‘unneeded and dangerous’

Judge Charles Breyer ruled Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal agents on immigration raids. The judge in Washington did not require the remaining troops withdrawn, however.

California sued, saying the troops sent to Los Angeles over the summer were violating a law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws. Lawyers for the Republican administration have argued the Posse Comitatus Act doesn’t apply because the troops were protecting federal officers not enforcing laws. They say the troops were mobilized under an authority that allows the president to deploy them.

It comes after the Herald spoke with seven people who accused Merivale of refusing them entry to the eatery on August 3 unless they took off their keffiyehs.

“This complaint is a critical step in challenging discriminatory practices and ensuring that businesses are held accountable for their actions,” she said.","A national community legal service has filed a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission against Merivale on behalf of six people who allege to have been turned away at a Middle Eastern restaurant for wearing Palestinian headscarves after the Harbour Bridge protest.

On Friday, the Racial Justice Centre filed a complaint under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) to the commission representing six Palestinian complainants who it claims were discriminated against at Merivale restaurant Jimmy’s Falafel.

The complaint alleges that Merivale’s Jimmy’s Falafel – which describes itself as “a little piece of the Middle East in Sydney’s CBD” – engaged in “indirect racial discrimination and racial vilification by enforcing a policy that required the complainants to remove their keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves, as a condition of entry”.

Merivale was contacted for comment after the complaint was lodged but did not respond by deadline.

It comes after the Herald spoke with seven people who accused Merivale of refusing them entry to the eatery on August 3 unless they took off their keffiyehs. Merivale initially denied the allegations but later said a management decision to ban people carrying or displaying flags and placards inside the venue was imposed for a 20-minute window.

The ban was said to have taken effect between 3.55pm and 4.15pm for the safety of Merivale employees after “many instances of rogue members of the public walking past the Ivy venues on George Street yelling obscenities and violent rhetoric into our venues”.

Police estimated at least 90,000 pro-Palestine protesters walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on August 3. Organisers say they estimated up to 300,000 people took part.

Merivale footage without audio, seen by the Herald, showed two people yelling towards the restaurant from the footpath, with another person raising two middle fingers. According to Merivale, passers-by shouted “death to the IDF”, “death to all Zionist pigs” and “f---ing Zionist pigs and scum” towards Jimmy’s.

Merivale said its staff understood its decision to include “political items of clothing” in the ban and they asked people wanting to dine in to “remove those items [or] place them in their bags before entering”.

The Herald observed multiple groups being turned back by security while wearing keffiyehs during a 20-minute window on the CCTV footage.

Keffiyeh designs differ among Middle Eastern nations. The Palestinian version is typically worn to show solidarity with Gazans.

The complaint alleged that the six people “left the restaurant feeling shocked, humiliated and distressed”. They are seeking “an apology, financial compensation and anti-racism training for Merivale staff”.

The lead complainant of the claim, who requested to remain anonymous, told the Herald she wanted to hold Merivale accountable for what she alleges is its discriminatory policy.

“Initially I was confused because this restaurant serves falafels and other dishes that are traditional to my Palestinian heritage … I was singled out and treated as a security threat because of my cultural garment,” she said.

“I was forced to choose between publicly expressing my cultural identity and accessing a public space. This incident has exacerbated my ongoing grief at witnessing my extended family be subjected to the most extreme forms of racial discrimination in Palestine.”

Racial Justice Centre executive director Sarah Ibrahim said she hopes this claim sends the message that all forms of racism have no place in society.

“This complaint is a critical step in challenging discriminatory practices and ensuring that businesses are held accountable for their actions,” she said.

The claim aims to resolve the issue of discrimination through conciliation, and if a resolution is not found, a dispute can be filed with the Federal Court.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.21957287995023844%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_no_age_social_wm/8bea3617ced1ead65e5a9314e49aa5480f116e40,N,,2025-09-02 10:56:45.375893

Asylum and immigration – briefing note

Posted by: Home Office news team, Posted on: - Categories: Fact sheet

This briefing note was issued following the Home Secretary's Oral Statement on 1 September to aid reporting.

UK-France Treaty

On 5 August, the UK-France Returns Agreement came into immediate effect following the signing of the treaty by the UK and French Interior Ministers.

This treaty enables the return of small boat arrivals from the UK to France, with an equal number of individuals eligible to come to the UK through a new legal route.

This is a pilot scheme which has the potential to undermine the business model of criminal gangs, while doing our bit to support genuine refugees. The more we prove the concept at the outset, the better we will be able to develop and grow it.

Returns to France are expected later this month.

International Cooperation

Thanks to agreements between Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau during their February visit to northern France, crucial new action is being taken to strengthen enforcement against small boats:

The deployment of over 70 Compagnie de Marche specialist officers has been extended and will continue to mobilise to increase patrols along the French coast.

Earlier this year, the UK and France agreed to reinforce the dual-powered intelligence unit stationed in Dunkirk to investigate and prosecute criminal gangs, enabling more effective investigations and faster convictions of people-smugglers.

For the first time, new maritime arrangements will enable French authorities to intercept small boats in shallow waters off the French coast, preventing them from continuing their dangerous journey across the Channel. We expect to be starting in coming weeks.

The government has also signed new agreements with Western Balkans countries and Germany to strengthen laws and intelligence sharing against people smuggling and signed various returns agreements with countries such as Iraq.

We have signed an Anti-Smuggling Action Plan with other G7 nations, hosted over 40 countries from across the world at the Border Security Summit on Organised Immigration Crime in London and launched a new international communications campaign to debunk people smugglers’ lies.

We are intensifying our collaboration with our European partners, including through the Calais Group of Interior Ministers, by exploring innovative measures to dismantle the business models of the criminal smuggling gangs and robustly deter these illegal journeys.

The number of Vietnamese nationals arriving by small boat in January to June 2025 was less than half the number in the equivalent period of 2024. This is a testament to our close international relationship with Vietnam, which is enhancing intelligence sharing between law enforcement to disrupt criminal networks along the route. This, alongside our international deterrent campaign, is debunking lies and myths peddled by vile people smugglers.

Secured agreement from Germany that it will change its laws making it a criminal offence to facilitate the smuggling of migrants to the UK and giving German prosecutors more tools to tackle the supply and storage of small boat equipment in warehouses.

Returns & Enforcement

We have returned over 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK— including a 28% increase in returns of failed asylum seekers.

Increased illegal working visits by 48% and arrests by 42%, with employers facing fines of up to £60,000 per illegal worker.

Agreed a new partnership with Uber Eats, and Deliveroo, maximising information sharing opportunities to tackle illegal working abuse in the food delivery sector.

Introduced new legislation to deport foreign criminals earlier and expanded the ‘Deport now, Appeal later’ scheme.

Detention capacity is being expanded with 1,000 new beds at Campsfield and Haslar sites, with the first beds going live by the end of the year enabling increased removals.

National Crime Agency

Along with the Border Security Command, the NCA are delivering rapid, intense and targeted multi-agency enforcement action to target UK-based OIC criminals. This includes an Immigration Enforcement led intensification operation to tackle illegal working within the gig economy.

This summer, we announced a £100 million uplift in funding for border security, with 300 more personnel in the NCA focused on targeting crime gang members, using new state-of-the-art technology and equipment for the detection and disruption of trafficking gangs.

The number of engines seized in Europe prior to facilitating illegal entry to the UK from July 2024 to 24 July 2025 is 71.

The number of boats seized since July 2024 until 24 July 2025 is 116. During the financial year 2024/25, the NCA was involved in more than 190 arrests (both in the UK and overseas) for OIC-related offences and 347 disruptions of immigration crime networks - their highest level on record and a 40 per cent increase on the previous twelve months.

We have increased the pace of social media post takedowns, with more than 8,000 being removed in 2024, a 40% increase on the previous year.

Legislation

We have introduced the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, giving law enforcement counter-terror-style powers to disrupt smuggling gangs.

This includes stronger powers to seize and search mobile phones and new offences against gangs conspiring to plan crossings and selling or handling small boat parts for use in the Channel.

The Bill criminalises the creation of online material promoting illegal immigration activity, including small boat crossings.

And foreign nationals who commit sex offences will be excluded from asylum protections under the Refugee Convention in the UK.

Asylum System Reforms

The asylum system we inherited was not fit for purpose, with appeals in the system for over a year on average.

We are overhauling asylum appeals with the most significant reforms in decades, to bring an end to these unacceptable delays and restore public confidence.

We have surged the number of initial decisions made, which is now sustained at 31,000 decisions per quarter up from an average of 10,000 per quarter last year.

The government is reforming asylum support and accommodation, reducing reliance on hotels and increasing use of alternative sites. Measures include;

The new Failure to Travel sanction, ensuring penalties for those who refuse to move to their designated dispersal accommodation.

From today, the government with reintroduce the normal 28-day Move On period for all single adults in receipt of a positive asylum decision.

To address appeal backlogs, a new independent appeals body will be established with statutory powers to prioritise cases from those in asylum accommodation and foreign national offenders.

In the immediate term, we are maximising capacity in the First Tier Tribunal by increasing sitting days and requiring appeal decisions within weeks not years, so we can clear the backlog, speed up returns, and cut costs.

The new legal requirement for a 24-week timeframe for asylum appeals by those receiving asylum accommodation support and appeals by foreign offenders will reduce these delays, and the new independent appeals body will eradicate them completely.

The system for family migration has become overly complex, developing increasingly around court decisions and case law, including court interpretations of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.

An overly high proportion of family-related immigration cases are now decided on the basis that they are “exceptional” to the normal rules, rather than being in line with the rules set down by Parliament, and that undermines control and confidence.

That is why we are reviewing the application of Article 8 in the immigration and asylum system - and we will bring forward new reforms to family rules so that it is Parliament, rather than ad hoc court decisions, that determines the way that the right to family life is applied. The Home Secretary has also asked for a number of specific cases to be examined in relation to Article 3.

Asylum Accommodation

The Government inherited an asylum system under exceptional strain with tens of thousands stuck in a backlog, claims not being processed and disastrous contracts that were wasting millions in taxpayer money.

The Home Office is exploring a variety of short-, medium- and longer-term options, in collaboration with other government departments - supporting the commitment to end the use of hotels whilst delivering a more sustainable, flexible system.

Decisions on potential options such as former student accommodation and government-owned properties will be made on a site-by-site basis, and we will continue to work closely with local authorities and in compliance with all rules and regulations.

From over 400 asylum hotels open in summer 2023, costing almost £9 million a day, there are now less than 210, and we want them all closed for good by the end of this Parliament.

The number of asylum seekers in hotels fell by almost 6,000 in the first three months of 2025 – down 15% from December.

The cost of hotels was £5.77m per day in 2024/25, down from £8.3m per day in 2023/24.

We are clear this is not a good use of public money, and we remain fully committed to ending the use of hotels as asylum accommodation completely and as soon as possible.

By restoring grip on the system and speeding up decision making, we will end the use of hotels and are forecast to save the taxpayer £1 billion per year by 2028-29 compared with 2025-26.

Refugee Family Reunion

Existing applications already in the system will continue to be processed in the normal way. The pause does not affect refugees' existing rights or those who have already been granted reunion visas.

In May 2025, the Government set out its plans to reform the framework for family migration in the Immigration White Paper. This included setting out a new family policy on refugees seeking to bring family members to the UK.

6 years ago, refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average close to 18 months after they were granted protection. However, those applications now come in on average within a month, with some councils finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion.

Denmark and Switzerland don’t allow those granted humanitarian status to apply to bring their family over for two years after protection has been granted.

The Home Secretary has announced the temporary suspension of refugee family reunion, while work to reform the route in the long term is undertaken.

Refugees will be able to make applications under the normal Family Migration route.

We remain committed to supporting refugee families while managing the impact on local communities and services. We are working with local authorities who face unprecedented demand for temporary accommodation.

(LWI) - The city of Ríohacha, on Colombia’s north-eastern tip, is the venue for the 15th Global Forum on Migration and Development, which is focusing on the theme of ‘Regular Migration, Labor Mobility and Human Rights: Pillars of Development and the Wellbeing of Societies’. The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) is present at the Forum, working with two civil society networks to ensure that the rights and dignity of migrants and displaced people are seen and heard by politicians and decision-makers.

The idea for the Forum was first proposed, almost two decades ago, by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. Since then, it has become an important platform for dialogue and sharing of best practices on migration, fostering inter-governmental cooperation and building partnerships between stakeholders including non-governmental organizations, businesses, civic leaders, academics and youth movements.

“At a time of rising criminalization of migrants, with restrictive and often inhumane laws, the Forum offers a vital opportunity to advocate for more humane policies and demand accountability for human rights violations,” says LWF’s Senior Advocacy Advisor Fabián Wilches, who is in Ríohacha for the 2 to 4 September meeting. “As civil society, we expect commitments from our governments to respect and protect the dignity and rights of migrants and others on the move,” he adds.

LWF plays an important role as one of the few faith-based organizations present at the Forum this year, Wilches notes. “As such, we bring the voices of our member churches offering invaluable support to migrants, returnees and local host populations,” he says. Among those is the Symbols of Hope initiative supporting migrants and refugees in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, while in Latin America, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Colombia (IELCO) works with migrants and host communities in cities across the country, including Bogotá, Villavicencio, Yopal, Paz de Ariporo and Turbo.

A place of hope, dignity and solidarity

“IELCO’s migrant ministry was founded in February 2019, when a church in Bogotá, with support from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), began accompanying families arriving in the capital, offering them a hot meal, a listening ear and some cash,” explains the ministry coordinator, Johana Morales Quiroga. “This simple but deeply meaningful gesture paved the way for us to develop a broader mission. Thanks to the support of LWF and others, including the ELCA, the AMMPARO network and ACT Alliance, we have been able to strengthen this service and to continue being a place of hope, dignity and solidarity for the migrant populations,” she says.

Today, the main focus of IELCO’s work is to provide comprehensive support to migrants and refugees in Colombia. This includes psychosocial and spiritual support, advice on case management, food and hygiene supplies, tutoring for children and technical skills training for adults. It also offers awareness-raising processes for churches and faith-based organizations on migration from a humanitarian and biblical-theological perspective.

“The goal is to share the gospel of Jesus Christi and to be a prophetic voice for the most vulnerable,” Morales continues. “Our aim is to strengthen local integration processes and to build capacity, especially in mixed groups of migrants and host communities. We also cooperate with LWF’s World Service program in Colombia and Venezuela on a joint project called Churches and Emergencies, which seeks to train churches in humanitarian aid and how to deal with different emergency situations.”

Staff at IELCO’s migrant ministry have many stories to tell of migrants who have been supported and successfully integrated into their new lives in Colombia. A mother, who arrived in Bogotá with her daughter suffering from a congenital disease, was provided with comprehensive support, including assistance in how to regularize their immigration process and obtain the necessary medical treatment. The mother was also offered training to develop a small business venture in order to improve their standard of living.

In northern Colombia, a family that had fled from Venezuela after facing political persecution requested support to move to a safer location. The migrant ministry was able to provide a safe route, as well as protection measures and follow-up to ensure that they arrived at their new destination. “It is so important for us that the Global Forum is being held in Ríohacha,“ concludes Morales, “because it recognizes the role of the local organizations in hosting migrants, highlighting the challenges and valuing solutions that are worked out at the local level.”",https://lutheranworld.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/Colobia-global-forum-migration.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 10:56:53.787247

Congressional representatives and senators, principally Democrats, have criticized the Trump administration’s approval of advanced semiconductor exports to China, citing national security and legal issues as issued in three separate letters across the aisle and in both chambers.

On August 22, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) introduced the No Advanced Chips for the CCP Act of 2025, requiring dual approval from the Executive Branch and Congress for AI chip exports, with limited humanitarian and diplomatic exceptions. In light of the AI race, the bill’s progress will be closely watched to see whether Congress attempts to affect US policy on advanced AI semiconductor exports.

On August 25, the FTC filed a lawsuit against Air AI Technologies, alleging that the company made deceptive claims about its conversational AI platform, causing significant financial losses for small business customers. The case highlights the Commission’s continued focus on holding AI companies accountable for marketing claims, despite the suggestion in the Trump AI plan that the FTC “pump the brakes” on AI enforcement.

Some Congressional Representatives and Senators push back against proposed AI chip sales to China

On August 25, House Select Committee on the CCP Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “urging the Trump administration to take a harsher line on export controls to restrict the sale of advanced semiconductors to Beijing.” His letter reflects growing unease within President Trump’s own party in light of his recent decision to permit sales of advanced chips from two US manufacturers to China in exchange for the US government receiving a 15% revenue share. Rep. Moolenaar has instead promoted a “rolling technical threshold (RTT)” framework, which would cap US chip exports to only slightly outperform China’s domestic capabilities and limit Beijing’s aggregate AI computing power to 10% of US levels, an approach he argues is critical to sustaining long-term US leadership in AI.

Meanwhile, Senior Democrats in both chambers sent letters to the administration “expressing concern over the Administration’s reported approval of export licenses for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in exchange for a cut of corporate revenue.”

House Select Committee on the CCP Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) criticized the administration for “flagrantly violating” existing export restrictions and warned that monetizing security-sensitive licenses risks undermining US credibility with allies in his letter to the administration.

“By requiring companies…to pay a percentage of their sales revenue to obtain export licenses, your Administration is flagrantly violating this clear legal prohibition,” Representative Krishnamoorthi wrote. “Allowing these exports at a profit sends a dangerous signal not only to the PRC but also to our allies, who rely on US leadership and integrity in advanced technology controls.”

A separate letter from six Senate Democrats similarly pressed the administration to reverse course, emphasizing that national security and military readiness are dependent “upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world.”

These concerns have prompted the introduction of legislation. On August 22, Rep. Krishnamoorthi introduced the No Advanced Chips for the CCP Act of 2025, co-led by Reps. Ami Bera (D-CA) and Jill Tokuda (D-HI). The “legislation [aims] to prevent advanced artificial intelligence semiconductors from reaching the People’s Republic of China (PRC) unless both the Executive Branch and Congress explicitly approve the transaction.” The bill would bar advanced AI semiconductor exports to China absent dual approval: first by the Secretary of Commerce (in consultation with other security agencies), and second through a joint resolution of Congress, with narrow exceptions for humanitarian, diplomatic, and repair-related purposes. It also would establish national security review factors, would mandate detailed reporting to Congress, and includes a three-year sunset provision to allow for reassessment as technology and threats evolve. The bill is now before the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

FTC Sues Air AI for Alleged Deceptive Marketing Practices

On August 25, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought a lawsuit against Air AI Technologies, alleging the company engaged in deceptive marketing practices tied to its “conversational AI” platform. The case, filed in the District Court of Arizona, centers on allegations that Air AI misled small business owners and entrepreneurs with exaggerated claims about the tool’s capabilities and financial benefits.

As part of the suit, the FTC requested a temporary restraining order to immediately halt Air AI’s marketing activities. According to the complaint, the company’s customers, “many of whom are small business owners, lost as much as $250,000 and are often left in debt” due to Air AI’s alleged misrepresentations.

FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Christopher Mufarrige underscored the stakes, noting that “companies that market AI-related tools with false promises of unrealistic investment returns and guaranteed refunds harm hardworking small business owners and undermine legitimate businesses’ adoption of AI.” The Commission voted 3-0 approving the filing of the complaint and continues to signal the FTC’s role in shaping the early regulatory environment for AI, emphasizing accountability for AI companies’ proclaimed capabilities. This action suggests that the FTC is not shutting down shop regarding AI related matters, despite the suggestion in the Trump AI Plan that the FTC should not shackle the development of AI or its expansion in the marketplace.

The complaint details several alleged misrepresentations by Air AI. The company and its executives, the FTC claims, promoted their flagship tool as “conversational AI,” asserting that it could function as a replacement for human customer service agents while also generating significant profits when paired with their other lines of business. The Commission contends, however, that customers did not achieve the promised financial outcomes, nor did they receive refunds despite assurances of recouped money from Air AI. The FTC further alleges that Air AI made unsubstantiated claims about “substantial earnings,” misrepresented the tool’s capabilities, and failed to provide mandatory disclosure documents and earnings claim statements.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration's struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo said sponsors must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says ""federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.""

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a ""built-in opportunity"" to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. ""As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,"" Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don't already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates ""clearly and proactively"" with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won't influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

""The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,"" it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

""We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,"" she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden's administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden's administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don't understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

""If we don't understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?"" said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

""It seems like it's designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,"" she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

Advocates who sued said the children they represent have said they fear going home, and that the government, by operating in the dead of night and by bypassing immigration courts, is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

Here’s a look at where things stand now:

The legal proceedings across the country

There are at least three legal cases going on around the country: Arizona, Washington, D.C., and Illinois. Representatives for unaccompanied migrant children are trying to stop the government from removing Guatemalan children who don’t have final orders of removal from the country. Those children are living in a network of shelters or foster care arrangements overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services.

In Illinois, lawyers representing four minor children, who were identified only by their initials, said they had received notice on August 29 that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intended to take the children from the shelters where they were being held under U.S. government care sometime on August 30 or September 1 and remove them from the U.S.

A judge blocked them from being taken out of the country at least until Wednesday afternoon. A hearing in the case is set for Wednesday morning.

In Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, which provides legal services for unaccompanied migrant children, filed a lawsuit on behalf of 53 children from Guatemala. The children were between the ages of three and 17 and living in shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas that care for unaccompanied migrant children. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Marquez on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from removing those children for at least two weeks. She said some children may have been in the process of being removed at the time, and ordered the government to return them to the U.S. immediately.

In Washington, D.C., Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ordered a 14-day temporary restraining order preventing the government from removing Guatemalan children in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody and sending them back to Guatemala.

What is Guatemala saying about this?

In July, the head of Guatemala’s immigration service said the government was looking to repatriate 341 unaccompanied minors who were being held in U.S. facilities.

During a news conference on Monday, Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo shed more light on the issue during his weekly news conference.

Arévalo said the country’s foreign affairs minister and ambassador to the United States toured detention facilities for minors and adults in the United States in March and were “very concerned,” especially about minors who were going to turn 18. The government decided it had to act in the best interest of the children to prevent them from being moved to adult detention centers. He said Guatemala told the U.S. that the government was willing to receive “all unaccompanied minors, who wanted to return to Guatemala voluntarily.”

Arévalo explained that his administration began working to identify the minors, their families and make arrangements for those willing to return, those who wanted to wait out their legal process in the U.S. and those who judges allowed to remain in the U.S. with a relative.

Guatemala is capable of receiving about 150 minors per week, he said. “It depends on our capacity to identify relatives for facilitate a safe return,” he said. The goal is that none of the children end up being institutionalized.

The president did not answer when asked if the number to be sent on Sunday surprised Guatemala’s government, or whether he thought the U.S. government carried out due process before putting the minors on planes.

He said his administration has told the U.S. government that once a judge decides an unaccompanied Guatemalan child cannot remain in the U.S., Guatemala will take them and reintegrate them.

“We have been in coordination with the United States about this, but the decision of the sending, the number that they are going to send and the rhythm at which they are going to send is a U.S. government decision,” Arévalo said.

How many children could be sent home?

One of the biggest questions outstanding is how many Guatemalan children will be sent back to Guatemala.

The head of Guatemala’s immigration service put the number at 341 in July. Then on Friday, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement saying that, according to whistleblower accounts, the office was intending to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children.

Also on Friday, Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said the exact number was in flux, but said they were currently discussing a little over 600.

The U.S. government indicated in a status report filed Sunday in the Washington, D.C., case that 76 children had been on planes to go to Guatemala and that those children were being returned to Office of Refugee Resettlement custody after the judge’s ruling.

There were believed to be two planes in Harlingen, Texas, and possibly another one in El Paso on Sunday, said the National Immigration Law Center. That is the group that filed a lawsuit Sunday in Washington, D.C., to stop the removals.

But it’s not clear if there were other children who had been removed from shelters and were en route to the planes before the judge entered the temporary restraining order.

Migrant kids have special protections

Migrant children traveling alone are usually entrusted to U.S. government care, and there are various legal protections designed to protect them once they’re in the U.S. and navigating the immigration system.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 is one of the key pieces of legislation designed to protect unaccompanied migrant children. With some limited exceptions, it generally requires that children be placed in the “least restrictive setting possible,” which generally means that they can be released to a sponsor such as a relative in the U.S. while their immigration proceedings play out.

The children can apply for a specially protected status if they can’t return to their home country because of abuse or neglect and they can also apply for asylum.

In court filings, advocates for Guatemalan children noted that only an immigration judge can decide whether an unaccompanied minor can voluntarily depart the U.S.

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”

Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”

‘Crops did go to waste’

Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.

In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.

“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.

Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,” said Lidia. “I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”

From construction to health care

Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.

“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.”

The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”

Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local’s president.

“What’s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?” De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren’t in the field to pick our crops? Who’s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?”",https://hot-town-images.s3.amazonaws.com/kwtv/production/2025/September/1/12-million-immigrants-gone-from-us-labor-force-under-trump.1756736225545.webp,N,,2025-09-02 12:00:04.946026

The decision affects approximately 80 Palestinian officials, although the Palestinian Mission to the UN in New York will continue operating under a limited waiver.
In 1988, the UN relocated its session to Geneva after the U.S. denied a visa to Yasser Arafat, then head of the PLO.
The current relocation is similarly aimed at ensuring full Palestinian participation, particularly in a scheduled September 22 segment dedicated to Palestinian rights.
President Abbas is expected to address the Assembly in Geneva, where he will call for international protection, recognition of Palestinian sovereignty, and accountability for war crimes.","The United Nations General Assembly will convene its September session in Geneva instead of New York, following the United States’ refusal to grant entry visas to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and dozens of senior officials.

The relocation marks a rare institutional challenge to the host nation and reflects mounting global frustration over Washington’s obstruction of Palestinian participation amid Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza.

The U.S. State Department justified the visa denial on grounds of “national security,” accusing the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization of “undermining peace efforts” through legal appeals to the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.

These appeals include formal charges of genocide and apartheid against Israel, claims the U.S. argues breach diplomatic norms and politicize international legal forums.

The decision affects approximately 80 Palestinian officials, although the Palestinian Mission to the UN in New York will continue operating under a limited waiver.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from legal experts and international diplomats, who say it violates the 1947 UN Headquarters Agreement, which obligates the host country to facilitate access for all accredited delegations.

In 1988, the UN relocated its session to Geneva after the U.S. denied a visa to Yasser Arafat, then head of the PLO. The current relocation is similarly aimed at ensuring full Palestinian participation, particularly in a scheduled September 22 segment dedicated to Palestinian rights.

European leaders have condemned the U.S. decision. Spain’s Prime Minister described the move as “unjust,” while France reaffirmed that UN platforms must remain accessible to all recognized delegations.

The Geneva session also coincides with growing momentum among several countries, including France, the United Kingdom, and Canada, to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, adding diplomatic weight to the proceedings.

Palestinian officials have denounced the U.S. action as a deliberate attempt to silence their voice at a time when Gaza faces mass displacement, starvation, and what UN experts have described as genocidal violence.

President Abbas is expected to address the Assembly in Geneva, where he will call for international protection, recognition of Palestinian sovereignty, and accountability for war crimes.

The Geneva session is expected to amplify calls for action under the “Uniting for Peace” resolution, which empowers the General Assembly to recommend collective measures when the Security Council is unable to act due to political obstruction or lack of consensus.

Advocacy groups are urging the UN to consider deploying international protection forces to Gaza and to suspend Israel’s privileges within the UN system until humanitarian access is restored.

Beyond its logistical implications, the relocation signals a deeper shift in global diplomacy, where procedural justice and international law are being reasserted against political obstruction.

The Geneva gathering is expected to draw high-level delegations, legal experts, and civil society leaders, all converging to confront the worsening crisis and to chart a path forward for Palestinian self-determination.",https://imemc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/United-Nations-Palac-e1756802880267.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 10:57:01.536679

The Fifth District considered and reversed the trial court based on an argument that the appellant had raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing.
The Sixth District's opinion notes, however, that its reasoning regarding preservation ""does not apply when a trial court grants a motion for rehearing and then rejects a new argument on its merits.""
""In such a case, the trial court has exercised its discretion to grant rehearing and consider the newly raised argument.""
There, the trial court had also denied the plaintiff's motion for continuance and request for an additional 90 days to complete discovery.","The short answer: It depends! Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530 explicitly states that on a motion for rehearing of ""matters heard without a jury, including summary judgments, the court may open the judgement if one has been entered, take additional testimony, and enter a new judgment."" Though the rule does not prohibit the making of new arguments in a motion for rehearing, whether such arguments are considered preserved for purposes of appeal is another matter. For those not versed in appellate speak, ""unpreserved"" means the appellate court will not consider the argument on appeal.

Florida's Sixth District Court of Appeal recently weighed in on this issue and held that a new argument presented to the trial court for the first time in a motion for rehearing (under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530) is unpreserved for purposes of the appeal, provided the trial court summarily denies the motion. Melrose Ventures, LLC v. Uptempo Mktg. Corp., No. 6D2023-3824, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 (Fla. 6th DCA 2025). In so holding, Florida's newest appellate court joined the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts ""who have already found that, as a general rule, new and different arguments untimely raised for the first time in motions for rehearing which were denied are unpreserved."" Id. at *4-5.

The Sixth District noted that the Third District had previously made the opposite holding in Bailey v. Treasure, 462 So. 2d 537, 539 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985) but because Bailey did not ""appear to be the currently prevailing law of the Third District,"" it did not certify conflict with Bailey. Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *5, n.4. But see Walden v. Chase Manhattan Bank, U.S.A., N.A., 872 So. 2d 432, 433 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004) (noting that a summary judgment ""is not final until a motion for rehearing is considered"" and reversing summary judgment based in part on ""supplement affidavits filed with the motion for rehearing"").

The Sixth District certified conflict with two opinions of the Fifth District which held that a party can preserve a new argument by raising it for the first time on rehearing. Id. at *7 (certifying conflict with Kawsar v. Alhamdi Grp., LLC, 369 So. 3d 1227, 1230 (Fla. 5th DCA 2023) and Elser v. Law Offs. Of James M. Russ, P.A., 679 So. 2d 309 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996)).

In Elser, the Fifth District reasoned that an ""order granting a motion for summary judgment is not final until the motion for rehearing is considered and disposed. 679 So. 2d at 312. ""Until then, a trial judge is free to consider any legal error or matter overlooked related to the entry of the summary judgment. Indeed, that is the very purpose of a motion for rehearing."" Id. The Fifth District considered and reversed the trial court based on an argument that the appellant had raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing.

The Sixth District, of course, is not bound by the decisions of its sister courts and made clear shortly after its creation that it intended to write on a clean slate. See CED Cap. Holdings 2000 EB, LLC v. CTCW-Berkshire Club, LLC, 363 So. 3d 192, 195 (Fla. 6th DCA 2023). As such, the Sixth District declined to follow Elser and was instead persuaded by the concurring opinion in the later Fifth District case of Kawsar. There, Judge Eisnaugle wrote that he agreed that the panel was bound by Elser, but that in his view Elser was wrongly decided. 369 So. 3d at 1229 (Eisnaugle, J., concurring). ""Agreeing with his well-reasoned analysis,"" the Sixth District expressly adopted the view that ""to preserve an argument, a party must make a timely, contemporaneous objection at the time of the alleged error."" Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *5-6 (cleaned up).

The Sixth District's opinion notes, however, that its reasoning regarding preservation ""does not apply when a trial court grants a motion for rehearing and then rejects a new argument on its merits."" Id. at *5 n.3. ""In such a case, the trial court has exercised its discretion to grant rehearing and consider the newly raised argument."" Id. (citing Crocker v. Crocker, 370 So. 3d 363, 365 (Fla. 5th DCA 2023)). It also does not apply to issues that could not have been raised before rehearing, such as when an error appears for the first time on the face of the order. Id. And, indeed, Rule 1.530 mandates that the failure of a trial court to make required findings of fact in the final judgment must be raised in a motion for rehearing for a party to preserve such a challenge on appeal.

Of course, a trial court has broad discretion to consider and address arguments that are raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing. A trial court may decide to do so, for example, to prevent what it would consider an injustice to a party resulting from an error or omission by one of the lawyers. And, indeed, appellate courts have held in some cases that a trial court abused its discretion by not considering an issue raised for the first time on rehearing. Those cases, however, typically involve ""extraordinary"" or ""exigent"" circumstances. See Dalrymple v. Franzese, 944 So. 2d 1240 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006). In Dalrymple, for example, the appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion in not considering the affidavit of an expert witness that was attached to a motion for rehearing where, because of Hurricane Wilma and its aftermath, the expert was unable to meet with the investigating officer and complete his investigation and affidavit before the summary judgment hearing. Id. at 1242-43. There, the trial court had also denied the plaintiff's motion for continuance and request for an additional 90 days to complete discovery.

In sum, the district in which the trial court sits will determine whether an argument raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing will be considered preserved for purposes of the appeal. As the First District does not appear to have yet decided the issue, counsel are free to argue that whichever side best serves their client in a particular case. Counsel in the Sixth, Fourth, Third or Second District who think the trial court abused its discretion in not considering an ""untimely"" argument should make that argument to the appellate court, though the standard of review presents an uphill battle. See Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *4 (noting that appellants ""made no attempt"" to show the Sixth District that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for rehearing).

Of course, the Florida Supreme Court could take up the issue and settle the conflict. The Fifth District could also decide, en banc, to recede from Elser if a later case presents an appropriate opportunity to do so. See BAM Trading Servs., Inc. v. State, 395 So. 3d 687, 694 (Fla. 1st DCA 2024) (Bilbrey, J., concurring) (""When faced with erroneous precedent, barring a decision from a higher court or a legislative change, we are required to consider the matter en banc before we can recede from it.""). Meanwhile, the particular district in which appellate litigants find themselves will likely be determinative of whether the arguments of their trial counsel made for the first time in a motion for rehearing will be considered on appeal.

Remember that motions for rehearing directed to final orders must be filed within 15 days of the filing of the order. See Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.530(b). However, motions for reconsideration, which are directed to non-final orders, are based on the trial court's inherent authority to reconsider any of its rulings prior to entry of the final judgment and, thus, may be filed at any point prior to entry of final judgment. See Seigler v. Bell, 148 So. 3d 473, 478-79 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014).

Union officials have said the loss of bargaining rights for federal employees inevitably hurts the members of the public the agencies serve.
If the administration prevails, it could mark the beginning of a broader erosion of collective bargaining rights, some analysts said.
But what Mr. Reagan did in 1981 looks moderate compared to what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. McCartin added.
In 1979, for example, President Jimmy Carter ordered employees in the Treasury Department’s office of intelligence support to be excluded from union rights.","More than 445,000 federal employees saw their union protections disappear in August, as agencies moved to comply with an executive order President Trump signed earlier this year that called for ignoring collective bargaining contracts with nearly one million workers.

The termination of protections followed an Aug. 1 appeals court ruling on legal challenges to Mr. Trump’s directive. The order, signed in late March, directed 22 agencies to ignore contracts for employees in specific unions. Last Thursday, Mr. Trump signed a second executive order stripping union rights from thousands of other employees at six additional agencies.

Mr. Trump said that the affected workers had roles that touched on national security, and that provisions in their labor contracts could interfere with his policies being carried out. He cited, for example, the role that Department of Veterans Affairs employees play in providing care for wounded troops in wartime.

Federal labor unions targeted in the executive orders have repeatedly sued the Trump administration, and in some cases forced the administration to temporarily pause the president’s efforts to shrink the federal work force and reshape the government. The American Federation of Government Employees has filed more than a dozen lawsuits related to the federal work force. The White House has likened this to a declaration of “war.”

So far, nine agencies have terminated union contracts that covered more than 445,000 federal workers from the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency, General Services Administration, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, and parts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

“This is literally the largest act of union busting in American history,” said Mike Podhorzer, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “There’s not another time when that many people lost their union.”

The attack on public sector labor unions is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to assert more control of the federal work force and make it easier to fire civil servants. The president has also crippled several independent boards that adjudicate employment disputes, interfering with a critical resource employees have to challenge their terminations.

Mr. Podhorzer and some labor historians predicted that Mr. Trump would strip bargaining rights from even more of the federal work force, and that the trend would eventually reach private sector unions.

At the V.A., where 395,000 employees lost their union rights, people who planned to take 16 weeks of parental leave, as negotiated in their union contracts, will only have a guarantee of 12 weeks, the minimum required by law. About 1,500 food service workers across the country will no longer get meal allowances, like free lunches. And employees working long shifts are no longer guaranteed a rest period that was negotiated for safety reasons.

Union officials have said the loss of bargaining rights for federal employees inevitably hurts the members of the public the agencies serve.

Inspectors at the Agriculture Department’s food safety and inspection division no longer have a formal process to raise safety concerns about products without facing retaliation, said Paula Soldner, the chair of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which is part of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“Inspectors are very reluctant to bring things to a supervisor’s attention in fear for their jobs,” she said. That could mean unsafe consumer products end up being sold to the public, she added.

At the V.A., employees regularly speak up about caregiving issues and appointment backlogs, said Naveed A. Shah, the political director at Common Defense, a veterans advocacy group.

“They could have addressed those challenges with management in the past and known that they have the support of the union to ensure that they aren’t going to be retaliated against or fired for bringing up those type of issues,” Mr. Shah said. “And now they don’t have that.”

That has already happened in the few weeks that nurses have been working without contracts, said Irma Westmoreland, a nurse at a veterans medical center in Atlanta and the chair of National Nurses United’s V.A. division.

This year, patient care problems related to staffing shortages have been on the rise because of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the federal work force, Ms. Westmoreland said. Nurses continue to document concerns, but agency managers have not been as responsive because they no longer have to be.

Union representatives can continue to help members with work-related disputes, Ms. Westmoreland said, but they have to take vacation time to do it.

The legal battle over Mr. Trump’s orders has continued, in some cases holding up the termination of more union contracts.

If the administration prevails, it could mark the beginning of a broader erosion of collective bargaining rights, some analysts said.

“What this does is signal to private sector employers that they can go to war with the unions” and not face legal consequences, said Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island.

Joseph A. McCartin, a labor history professor at Georgetown University, pointed to the impact of President Ronald Reagan’s firing of air traffic controllers in 1981.

“It demonstrated to private sector employers the leverage that could be had by taking an aggressive approach to unions, to collective bargaining,” he said. But what Mr. Reagan did in 1981 looks moderate compared to what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. McCartin added.

“It is an action that’s almost incomparable in terms of what a president can do to undermine unions,” Mr. McCartin said.

And a recent decision in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, if upheld, would further hurt private sector unions by allowing the president to fire board members of the National Labor Relations Board, which was created to oversee and enforce federal labor law.

During his first term, Mr. Trump had a more moderate position on labor unions, Mr. Loomis said, and his labor secretaries operated within the standards of collective bargaining.

This time is different.

To strip collective bargaining rights from nearly half of the federal work force, Mr. Trump leaned on a provision in a 1978 law that gives the president the authority to exclude certain agencies or divisions from collective bargaining rights if there is “primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.”

Mr. Loomis said that identifying national security as the primary function in some of the agencies targeted was spurious at best. But as a result, Mr. Trump’s directive applies far more broadly than previous orders.

In 1979, for example, President Jimmy Carter ordered employees in the Treasury Department’s office of intelligence support to be excluded from union rights. Mr. Trump’s order calls for the entire Treasury Department to be stripped of collective bargaining rights, with the exception of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

Topline:

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a proposed $10 million program to provide rental assistance to tenants affected by January’s destructive fires, as well as recent Trump administration immigration enforcement efforts.

Who should apply: If the plan is approved by the board, the county’s Department of Consumer and Business Affairs would have 60 days to set up a new Emergency Rent Relief Program. It would prioritize a few groups of people:

Renters who lost income because of the fires

Displaced families who have run out of rent support from insurance plans or FEMA

Small landlords struggling to pay for post-fire building repairs

Households that have lost income because of federal immigration raids

The context: Shortly after the fires, L.A. County leaders approved eviction protections that allowed tenants to delay paying rent if they qualified under the county’s rules and gave their landlords sufficient notice.

Voces Unidas President and CEO Alex Sanchez filed two complaints on Aug. 14 with Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office over incidents involving the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office and the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which covers Routt, Moffat and Grand counties.

Voces Unidas shared both complaints with the Summit Daily News.

Sanchez said the incidents, which involved some communication between those offices and ICE, raised concern because of state laws that restrict information sharing and coordination with federal immigration enforcement officials.

“Our organization has been hearing from community members in the Western Slope, in particular, about some of the distrust that they have with our local governments,” Sanchez said in an interview.

Colorado lawmakers over the past several years have moved to limit ICE’s reach in local communities, starting with a major law in 2019 that prohibits law enforcement from complying with ICE “detainers,” which is a request by the federal agency to hold someone in jail past their release time so that they may be taken into federal custody.

That law also prevents law enforcement from sharing immigration-related information about an individual with ICE, and makes it illegal for local authorities to arrest someone just based on their immigration status.

Other laws passed in 2021 and 2025 block state agencies, judicial and legislative branches, as well as local governments, from sharing an individual’s personal information with ICE, unless it is for a federal criminal investigation where a judge has issued a warrant. The 2025 law, Senate Bill 276 , also carries a $50,000 fine per violation.

ICE activity has been top of mind for advocates as the federal government expands immigration enforcement operations across the country, including in Colorado’s mountain towns . ICE is also reportedly planning to double its detention spaces this year with new facilities, including three planned in Colorado, according to reporting by The Washington Post .

Sanchez said it’s important for state and local agencies not to be seen by the immigrant community as an extension of ICE, which he worries would have a chilling effect on people’s participation with law enforcement. He said his organization is not interested in what a person’s criminal charges are, just that state laws and due process are being upheld.

“What Voces Unidas is interested in is ensuring that we don’t erode the public trust between the community and our local municipalities and local police departments,” he said.

Both the Garfield County sheriff and the district attorney for the 14th Judicial District say they complied with state laws and deny any wrongdoing.

When reached for comment, Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario said he was unaware of the complaint filed against his office, while District Attorney Matt Karzen learned about the allegations against his office from a post Voces Unidas made on its website last week. The group also posted about the Garfield County incident .

Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for Weiser’s office, did not comment on the complaints.

Man taken into ICE custody in Garfield jail’s sallyport

The complaint lodged against Vallario’s office centers around a man who was arrested and jailed in Garfield County on Aug. 8 and released later that day into ICE custody.

Sanchez said Voces Unidas spoke with the man’s family after he’d been detained by ICE, and the organization called the jail in Glenwood Springs to confirm what happened. According to the complaint, they were told by a sheriff’s deputy that the man had “bonded out” and was taken into ICE custody in the jail’s sallyport, which is used for secure entrances and exits.

Sanchez said the incident “felt like the transfer of an inmate,” which spurred suspicion from Voces Unidas that it could have violated restrictions on ICE collaboration. He said the man should have been allowed to leave the jail, after which point ICE could have detained him.

“He was not allowed to the freedom that he absolutely deserved because he was already bonded out,” Sanchez said. “It wasn’t like ICE was across the street and this was an encounter of chance.”

Vallario said the man was charged with resisting arrest, a protection order violation, driving without a license, fictitious license plates, open containers for alcohol and marijuana, and driving without taillights. He said he isn’t aware of any federal criminal charges against the man.

Vallario confirmed in a phone interview that the man was detained by ICE in the jail’s sallyport and said there’s “nothing that I’m aware of that prohibits us from making that transfer” in that area.

SB 276 does require public buildings like schools, libraries and child care centers to develop policies for giving ICE access to non-public spaces. But it does not prevent immigration officers from operating in private sections of government buildings, like jails, if given permission.

It is common practice for law enforcement to tell ICE when an inmate is going to be released from a jail, Vallario added. He said his office does not hold people for ICE or share information about their immigration status, which would be a violation of state law.

“Once they’re released from custody, it is up to (ICE), whether or not they want to come and pick them up and hold them or not,” Vallario said. “In this particular case, it appears they did.”

Violeta Chapin, an immigration law professor at the University of Colorado School of Law in Boulder, said law enforcement officials can communicate with ICE about an inmate’s release under state law.

She said ICE can also perform operations under “administrative warrants,” which are signed by immigration officials, not a judge.

“Immigration officials are allowed to execute administrative warrants in public places, or, if they’re given permission to enter (non-public spaces),” said Chapin, who has a background in assisting immigrants’ legal cases as head of the university’s pro bono immigration defense clinic.

Chapin added, however, that even if an agency like a sheriff’s office is following the law, its actions can lead to a perception in the community that it’s helping ICE with detainments.

“That will have consequences for how people in the community see local law enforcement,” Chapin said.

Vallario has expressed frustration with the state’s immigration laws, and earlier this year wrote a column explaining what his office is, and isn’t, allowed to do under state laws.

Garfield County has also pushed back on claims of being a “sanctuary” community. Commissioners last year passed a resolution rejecting the term , which was condemned by local immigration leaders who called the resolution’s language “divisive.”

The resolution said people who enter the country illegally can pose a “significant public health and safety risk,” tying them to increased crime, disease and demand on public infrastructure and services.

Prosecutor in Steamboat discussed ‘detainer’ on defendant in court

Sanchez’s other complaint is against the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which had received information from ICE about the potential detainment of a defendant in district court that was then discussed in a court hearing last month.

Court transcripts show that during a July 31 bond hearing in Steamboat Springs, Deputy District Attorney Joseph Bucci told Judge Erin Wilson he had “received information from the federal government that ICE has lodged a detainer against this defendant.”

The defendant in the Steamboat Springs case, a woman, was arrested for theft and felony identity theft . She had been arrested alongside a man, who faces the same charges and also has charges of felony identity theft in Adams County, according to the district attorney’s office.

All of those are state charges, and the district attorney’s office said it is not aware of any federal charges or warrants.

Sanchez said information sharing with federal immigration officials is only allowed during federal criminal investigations, and questioned why the district attorney’s office would be communicating with ICE to learn about a detainer and why it would be discussed during a bond hearing over state charges.

He added that a detainer — a request by ICE for local law enforcement to hold someone — shouldn’t be relevant since Colorado authorities aren’t allowed to comply with the request.

“Again, we need the public to trust local DAs. We need the public to be able to report crimes. We need the public to want to come to court,” Sanchez said. “We need the system to work and to work for everyone.”

Karzen, the district attorney, said asking ICE if a detainer has been lodged against a defendant is not the same as sharing immigration-related information with ICE. He said the practice is within state law and necessary for his office to do its job.

Karzen learned about the allegations made by Voces Unidas after a county commissioner reached out to his office to inquire about the post that was made on the advocacy group’s website.

When reached for comment over email, Karzen shared an Aug. 13 email he’d sent to Routt County Attorney Lynaia South in which he explained the process for reaching out to ICE about detainers.

Karzen said his office has periodically gotten cases where the accused person has a criminal history that indicates they have previously been removed from the country by ICE.

“With the increase in immigration enforcement, we began to see cases where ICE detained the person but we did not know about it,” meaning that person would not appear in court, Karzen wrote.

Karzen said his office has started to ask ICE when defendants are in their custody if they believe someone may have been detained and/or removed in the past, as noted in their criminal history. If someone is in ICE detention, Karzen said his office needs to know so they can adjust accordingly, such as obtaining a video court appearance from the defendant in an ICE facility.

In the Steamboat Springs case, Karzen said both defendants had identifications of prior detention and/or removals, and that the deputy district attorney needed to know if ICE was intending to detain and/or deport the defendants in the case so he could make decisions around bonds, a plea and sentencing agreement, or any victim interactions required under the Victims’ Rights Act. He also said it is important for court scheduling and case management.

Karzen said asking ICE about the status of a defendant as it relates to detention is the extent of his office’s interactions with the federal agency. He added that his office is requesting information, not providing it to ICE.

Chapin, the CU law professor, said she would argue that discussing someone’s detainer in state court is irrelevant to their criminal proceedings. But she said prosecutors aren’t prohibited from having or sharing that information in court.

In an emailed response to questions from the Summit Daily, Karzen called Voces Unidas’ complaint against his office “profoundly disappointing,” saying the group never reached out to his office “for comment, or to articulate their concerns or ask for an explanation.”

“Voces Unidas appears to be an important vehicle of advocacy on the Western Slope in an area where such advocacy has perhaps never been more important,” Karzen said, “and yet their lack of due diligence and apparent apathy as to the full truth regarding these matters is exactly the kind of thing that can destroy credibility.”

Legal battles arise

Sanchez said Voces Unidas sent both complaints to the attorney general’s office “so that they can actually review the facts, have conversations, and then make a determination whether in fact there was inappropriate behavior or not.”

Sanchez said the enactment of SB 276 earlier this year provides local groups with an important tool for accountability since it carries, for the first time, fines for violations.

Whether the attorney general’s office will act on the complaints is unclear. Pacheco, the spokesperson, declined to say how many complaints the office has received following the enactment of SB 276.

The law has, however, already sparked several legal battles, including a July 22 lawsuit filed by Weiser’s office against a Mesa County Sheriff’s Office deputy who allegedly shared information with federal immigration officials that led to the arrest of a Utah college student who had an expired visa.

Mesa County later countersued, claiming that the state law is too vague.

Another lawsuit was filed on June 4 against Gov. Jared Polis by Scott Moss, the head of the Colorado Division of Labor Standards and Statistics. Moss alleges that Polis sought to force his department to provide information to ICE regarding 35 state-vetted adult sponsors who were housing unaccompanied immigrant children.

Moss said the request from ICE was not backed by a court-issued warrant and that complying with it would violate the state’s laws on information sharing.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/9/2025/08/19174332/Sanchez-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 02:57:26.249126

Jamal’s attorney said that a judge previously granted Jamal protection against deportation.

“Years ago, a U.S. immigration judge found that Mr. Jamal would face persecution if returned to Somalia and granted him protection from removal under U.S. law,” said attorney Abdiqani A.

According to KARE-TV, court records from 2005 show Jamal was previously convicted of immigration fraud in Tennessee, resulting in one year of probation, which included being referred to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for deportation. In later filings, documents show his attempt to appeal the conviction was unsuccessful, but he was not deported.

Rome signed the Italy–Libya Memorandum in 2017, funding and equipping Libyan patrols.","The European Union’s efforts to secure its external borders have been questioned after a Libyan naval vessel opened fire on a French ship that was rescuing migrants.

Although no one was killed or injured, the incident has led to a major political row in Italy, which gave the Libyans the boat as part of an EU program.

On Aug. 24, the Ocean Viking, a ship belonging to the French NGO SOS Méditerranée, came under fire in international waters about 40 nautical miles off the coast of Libya.

The Ocean Viking had just rescued 87 people from a rubber dinghy when a Libyan coast guard patrol boat approached and opened fire at close range.

“Without any warning or ultimatum, two men aboard the patrol vessel opened fire on our humanitarian ship, unleashing at least 20 relentless minutes of assault gunfire directly at us,” the NGO said in a statement, denouncing what it called a “violent and deliberate attack.”

The vessel sustained serious damage: shattered windows, broken antennnae, bullet holes in the bridge and destroyed rescue equipment. Prosecutors in Siracusa, Sicily have opened a criminal investigation into the attack. Last week, police boarded the Ocean Viking in the town of Augusta in Sicily, where the 87 rescued migrants disembarked, to inspect the damage and gather testimony.

According to SOS Méditerranée, the boat that attacked them was a Corrubia-class patrol vessel built in Italy and given to Libya in 2023 under the EU Border Assistance Mission in Libya program, part of Europe’s strategy of outsourcing border control.

During the attack, the Ocean Viking crew issued a mayday call and alerted NATO, which referred them to the Italian navy. “However, the Italian Navy never answered the phone,” the NGO said in its statement.

Valeria Taurino, the director of SOS Méditerranée Italy, called for “a thorough investigation” into the incident and an end to European cooperation with Libya. “An entity that makes illegal claims in international waters, obstructs rescues, and attacks unarmed humanitarian operators cannot be considered a competent authority,” she said.

After the 87 rescued people left the ship, the Ocean Viking and its crew were held in isolation for several days on health grounds, as one of those rescued tested positive for tuberculosis. On Friday the NGO announced the Italian authorities had finally lifted the quarantine, allowing the crew to disembark.

The Italian government — led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — has been clamping down on NGOs as part of its drive to reduce migration. On Monday another rescue ship — the Mediterranea — was placed under administrative detention after it let 10 migrants disembark in Trapani — the nearest safe port — instead of following Interior Ministry orders to sail to Genoa, some 770 kilometers away.

The move reflects stricter rules introduced in 2023 by Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, which require that NGO ships notify authorities after a rescue and then sail immediately to a designated port, often hundreds of kilometers away. Critics say the measure cripples rescue operations by forcing vessels to make long detours.

“It’s like forcing a burn victim to remain in the flames,” said Laura Marmorale, president of Mediterranea Saving Humans, denouncing the policy as “inhumane” and “unacceptable.”

The incidents have led to sharp criticism of the Italian government. Opposition leader Elly Schlein of the Democratic Party urged the government to end its migration deal with Libya, while Green Europe lawmaker Angelo Bonelli condemned the use of Italian-built boats to launch attacks on NGOs. He denounced Meloni’s silence as a “political and moral surrender that humiliates our country before Europe and the world.”

However, Piantedosi pointed the finger at NGOs rather than at the Libyan shooters. “It is the State that fights human traffickers and manages and coordinates rescues at sea. Not the NGOs,” he wrote on social media.

EU institutions reacted more cautiously. During a press briefing on Tuesday, a Commission spokesperson described the Ocean Viking episode as “worrying,” saying Brussels had contacted Libyan authorities to “clarify the facts.” The EU’s border agency Frontex called the incident “deeply concerning” and called for a swift investigation, stressing: “No rescuer should ever be put in danger while carrying out life-saving work.”

Speaking at a conference in Rimini last week, Meloni said her policies had “drastically” reduced arrivals and cut “the number of deaths and missing persons at sea.” She framed her migration crackdown as a humanitarian success: “Nothing is more important than saving a human life, than tearing it away from the claws of human traffickers.”

Yet critics argue that Italy’s approach comes at the cost of partnering with abusive countries.

In January, the government faced backlash for releasing Osama Al-Masri Njeem, a Libyan general wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. A 2021 video shared by the NGO Refugees in Libya shows Al-Masri allegedly executing a man in Tripoli.

EU’s migration gamble

The attack on the NGO vessel has highlighted Europe’s uneasy partnership with Libya.

Since the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has fractured and become a major transit hub for migrants from Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia.

Despite widespread reports of torture, sexual violence and forced labor in Libya’s detention system, the EU and Italy have continued to support the Libyan coast guard. Rome signed the Italy–Libya Memorandum in 2017, funding and equipping Libyan patrols. The deal, criticized by rights groups, was renewed in 2019 and again in 2023. Since taking office in 2022, Meloni has tightened those ties further, securing an $8 billion gas deal in 2023.

At the same time, the EU has spent more than €91 million on border and migration management in Libya since 2014 as part of a €338 million migration package, while Italy has spent nearly €300 million on containment measures since 2017.

But oversight of these funds remains weak. In a report released in September 2024, the European Court of Auditors warned that more than €5 billion from the EU Trust Fund for Africa had been disbursed with insufficient controls.

Europe’s reliance on Libya is complicated further by rivalries with other powers. Russia has expanded its presence through arms supplies and a planned naval base in Tobruk, while Turkey is accused of cutting maritime deals with Libyan authorities that Greece deems illegal under international law.

In July, EU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner defended the need for Brussels to activate talks with Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar as a necessary step to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from further weaponizing migration.

“There is certainly a danger that Russia … [will] use migrants and the migration issue as a weapon against Europe,” he told POLITICO. “This weaponization is taking place, and of course we also fear that Russia intends to do the same with Libya.”

In July, Brunner was ejected from Benghazi as “persona non grata” over an apparent breakdown in diplomatic protocol. He had been leading a delegation of senior EU representatives — including ministers from Italy, Malta and Greece — in an attempt to discuss efforts to tackle the flow of migrants into Europe from the country.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01/11916904-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-09-01 22:56:16.706524

Yvette Cooper announced a crackdown on refugees bringing family members into Britain, prompting backlash for restricting the last safe route for women and children.

Reforms will be made to the interpretation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to private and family life.

New applications under the existing refugee family reunion route will be temporarily suspended this week, the Home Secretary added.

A new framework will be introduced in spring, but until then, “refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else,” Ms Cooper said.

Care4Calais CEO Steve Smith said: “We are forever hearing cries that refugees seeking protection should do so through official channels, but here we have the government restricting the last available safe route for women and children.

“Shutting off the hope of family reunification will only force more women and children to take dangerous journeys to seek sanctuary, including risking their lives by crossing the Channel.

“This is an ill-conceived approach from a government that won’t stand up to the rhetoric of Reform, nor the far-right hate we are witnessing on our streets, but is instead mimicking it and making things substantially worse for refugees, communities and themselves.”

Stand Up To Racism also slammed the decision.

Co-convener Sabby Dhalu said: “The right to asylum and to a family life are basic human rights that the government should be protecting.

“Instead it is making concession after concession to an emboldened far right.”

Ms Cooper reiterated the government’s pledge to close refugee hotels “for good,” boasting that it had already cut costs by £1 billion in the last financial year.

It comes following a summer of demonstrations organised by the far right outside asylum accommodation up and down the country.

“ We are reconfiguring sites, increasing room sharing, tightening the test for accommodation, and working at pace to identify alternative, cheaper and more appropriate accommodation with other government departments and with local authorities”, she said.

Migrants Rights Network CEO Fizza Qureshi said: “Conditions in these hotels are not suitable for people awaiting asylum decisions, particularly when we know of people who have been waiting for six years or more for an outcome.

“However, the decision to end the use of asylum hotels should be made on the basis of welfare for those seeking asylum, not pandering to the far right.”

Ms Qureshi urged the Home Office to create sustainable solutions that allow asylum-seekers to be part of communities, rather than “basing policy decisions on the demands of racist demonstrations.”

The Home Secretary also gave an update on a pilot scheme with France, which will see some refugees arriving by small boats returned to the country, saying that the first returns will begin “later this month.”

She blasted the previous Tory government for leaving an asylum and immigration system in “chaos” with a soaring asylum backlog.

But Amnesty UK’s Steve Valdez-Symonds said the condemnation “rings hollow because she pursues largely the same ambitions.”

“She does so by applying the very misguided rules her predecessors introduced, and the dismal results are clear for all to see.

“The clear reason for the appeals backlog, of which she complains, is that she is refusing asylum to people who are refugees, but who cannot meet the flawed rules in the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

“The Home Secretary may say she is standing against hate, division and chaos, but yet again she has reacted to precisely these evils by doing more harm to refugees — the very people most targeted by them.”

Freedom from Torture’s Sile Reynolds said: “For survivors of torture, reuniting with their wives and children enables them to move on from the horrors of their past in the knowledge that their loved ones are safe.

“The solution that the Home Secretary is failing to grasp is so simple: improve initial asylum decisions and stop punishing refugees so that they stand a chance of rebuilding their lives amongst friends and family in our communities.”",https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/2025-09/PA-81163036.jpg.webp?itok=zBuRWcYG,N,,2025-09-01 22:56:21.645392

For the Coalition, it was about stopping so-called “illegals”.

For Labor, it was framed as “saving lives at sea”.

For both, it was about keeping people seeking asylum out of contact with the Australian community, demonised and dehumanised, called by numbers, not names.

Against this backdrop, it’s perhaps unsurprising Australians turned out in the thousands to rally against immigration this weekend. It could be seen as the culmination of years of MPs using immigration issues for short-term political gain.

But just as government messaging has partly contributed to this situation, it could also help get us out of it.

Not always ‘sinister invaders’

Political language about immigration wasn’t always so negative.

At the end of the second world war, then-Prime Minister Ben Chifley welcomed 170,000 refugees and other displaced people from Europe.

In the 1970s, when the first boats of Vietnamese asylum seekers arrived in Australia’s north, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser insisted they be treated humanely and processed fairly.

As writer Thomas Keneally recalled:

“there was no long-term mandatory detention involved. The newcomers were not depicted as sinister invaders […] language was not misused and neither were human souls.”

And as former Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said in 2023:

“Seventy years ago, of course, we embarked on a migration journey that has transformed our nation into a diverse and dynamic multicultural society […] in very large part […] shaped by the nearly one million refugees who have come to Australia since the end of WWII. We should take great pride in this.”

‘Real people, real families’

The threatening thuggery on display at the weekend’s anti-immigration marches has been rightly called out by Australian politicians on both sides.

In a change from her predecessor’s hardline approach, Federal Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said while “strong borders keep us safe, they also allow us to be generous and compassionate to those fleeing conflict”.

Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke reiterated “there is no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion”.

At the same time, we can’t simply ignore concerns people have about the impact of immigration on housing, cost of living and infrastructure – much of which is based on misinformation which feeds a far-right agenda, according to Multicultural Affairs Minister Anne Aly.

When misinformation spreads, it impedes evidence-based decision-making and results in poor laws and policies.

The positive role of immigration is something the opposition’s new immigration spokesman, Senator Paul Scarr, wants to stress.

He seems to be setting a new tone based on empathy, not division, drawing on his deep “respect and admiration” for migrant and refugee communities who are making “an outstanding contribution”.

When “we talk about immigration”, he says, “we should never forget that we’re actually talking about real people, real families”.

When Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came to office in 2022, he stressed the importance of a vision for Australia that promotes “unity and optimism, not fear and division”.

The naval base will be providing Building 617 — the Great Lakes Library — as a command center for the immigration operations, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Last week, Naval Station Great Lakes Commanding Officer Captain Stephen M. Yargosz said in an internal email that agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would be stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes from September 2-30.

“These operations are similar to what occurred in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Same DHS team,” Yargosz said in the email, according to a report from the Chicago Sun-Times.

A spokesperson for the base confirmed the Department of Homeland Security asked the Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support” in regard to immigration operations.

That support was in the form of “facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations.”

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Sunday that while ICE already had operations ongoing in Chicago and throughout Illinois, there will be additional resources added to the operations.

“I won’t disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority, but we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do,” Noem said.

“Focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe,” she said.

“Operations are ramping up across the country. You’re going to see a ramp up of operations in Chicago, absolutely,” Trump border czar Tom Homan said last week.

“All of these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with ICE, where we know public safety threats are being released every day into this country, especially those cities, we’re going to address that,” Homan said.

Homan did not disclose how many additional ICE agents would be sent to Chicago but that it would be a “large contingent.”

Homan declined to say whether or not the National Guard would be sent to Chicago. “The National Guard will be in cities that have crime problems,” he said.

Illinois Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart, Illinois State Representative Rita Mayfield, U.S. Representative Brad Schneider, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham, Jr. and others gathered at Veterans Memorial Park in North Chicago on Friday to oppose the Trump administration’s planned operation.

Stratton called the immigration blitz being staged at Great Lakes an “engineered crisis” not for safety but for “spectacle.”

“Trump does not want law and order. He wants unchecked power and unrelenting intimidation,” Stratton said.

U.S. Representative Brad Schneider said last week that the president’s threat to send National Guard troops to Chicago and “parade masked ICE agents” through Naval Station Great Lakes is an “unnecessary, unacceptable, and dangerous action.”

The Secretary of State for the Home Department

(Yvette Cooper)

With permission, I will update the House on the actions we are taking with France to strengthen our border security and the next steps in our reforms to the asylum system.

The House will be aware that when we came into government, we found an asylum and immigration system in chaos: for seven years, small boat gangs had been allowed to embed their criminal trade along the French coast; the asylum backlog was soaring; and illegal working was being ignored. The previous Government had lost control of the system and, as a result, opened many hundreds of asylum hotels across the country, while returns were a third lower than in 2010. Before leaving office, they deliberately cut asylum decision making by 70%, leaving behind a steeply rising backlog. It is little wonder that people across the country lost confidence in the system and demanded to know why they were paying the price of a system that was so out of control.

However, that does not mean that people rejected the long and proud history of Britain doing our bit to help those fleeing persecution or conflict—including, in the past decade, families from Ukraine, Syria and Hong Kong. It is the British way to do our bit alongside other countries to help those who need sanctuary. However, the system has to be controlled and managed, based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs. It is exactly because of our important tradition that substantial reforms are needed now.

In our first year in government, we have taken immediate action, laying the foundations for more fundamental reform. We restored asylum decision making and then rapidly increased the rate of decisions. Had we continued with the previous Government's freeze on asylum decisions, thousands more people would have been in hotels and asylum accommodation by now. Instead, we removed 35,000 people with no right to be here, which included a 28% increase in returns of failed asylum seekers and a 14% increase in removals of foreign criminals. We have increased raids and arrests on illegal working by 50%, and we cut the annual hotel bill by almost a billion pounds in the last financial year. We are rolling out digital ID and biometric kits so that immigration enforcement can check on the spot whether someone has a right to work or a right to be in the UK. On channel crossings and organised immigration crime, we are putting in place new powers, new structures and new international agreements to help to dismantle the criminal industry behind the boats.

I want to update the House on the further steps we are now taking. In August, I signed the new treaty with France allowing us, for the first time, to directly return those who arrive on small boats. The first detentions—of people immediately on arrival in Dover—took place the next day, and we expect the first returns to begin later this month. Applications have been opened for the reciprocal legal route, with the first cases under consideration, subject to strict security checks. We have made it clear that this is a pilot scheme, but the more that we prove the concept at the outset, the better we will be able to develop and grow it.

The principles the treaty embodies are crucial. No one should be making these dangerous or illegal journeys on small boats; if they do, we want to see them swiftly returned. In return, we believe in doing our bit alongside other countries to help those who have fled persecution through managed and controlled legal programmes.

This summer we have taken further action to strengthen enforcement against smuggling gangs. France has reviewed its maritime approach to allow for the interception of taxi boats in French waters, and we will continue to work with France to implement the change as soon as possible. In the past year, the National Crime Agency has led 347 disruptions of immigration crime networks—its highest level on record, and a 40% increase in a year.

Over the summer, we announced a £100 million uplift in funding for border security and up to 300 more personnel in the National Crime Agency focusing on targeting the smuggler gangs. The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will give them stronger powers: counter-terrorism powers against smuggler gangs, powers to seize and download the mobile phones of small boat arrivals, and the power to ban sex offenders from the asylum system altogether. If Opposition parties work with us to speed the passage of the Bill through the other place, instead of opposing it, those powers could be in place within months, making our country safer and more secure.

Let me turn to the major reforms that are needed to fix the broken asylum system that we inherited. Although we have increased decision making and returns, the overall system remains sclerotic, outdated and unfair. As we committed to in the immigration White Paper, we will shortly set out more radical reforms to modernise the asylum system and boost our border security. We will be tackling the pull factors, strengthening enforcement, making sure that people are treated fairly and reforming the way that the European convention on human rights is interpreted here at home. We will be speeding up the system, cutting numbers and ending the use of hotels, and developing controlled and managed routes for genuine refugees.

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system—the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use. Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals, and under the current system that figure is to grow, with an average wait time already of 54 weeks. We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year, and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks.

However, we need to go further. We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals. It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators, with safeguards to ensure high standards. It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases, alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays. We are also increasing detention and returns capacity, including a 1,000-bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar, with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year.

Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration, including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted. We should be clear that international law is important. It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France, to return people who arrive on small boats, and with Germany, to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs, and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries. However, we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today's world.

There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes. The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war, conflict and persecution, but the way they are used has now changed. Even just before the pandemic, refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection, which was long enough for them to get jobs, find housing and be able to provide their family with some support. In Denmark and Switzerland, those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted.

However, in the UK those family applications now come in, on average, around a month after protection has been granted, often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation. As a consequence, refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance. Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion. That is not sustainable. Currently, there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors, unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long-term UK resident. That is not fair.

The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years, with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK. We continue to believe that families staying together is important, which is why we will seek to prioritise family groups among the applicants to come to Britain under our new deal with France, but reforms are needed. So in our asylum policy statement later this year, we will set out a new system for family migration, including looking at contribution requirements, longer periods before newly granted refugees can apply, and dedicated controlled arrangements for unaccompanied children and those fleeing persecution who have family in the UK.

We aim to have some of those changes in place for the spring, but in the meantime we do need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to dangerous boats. Therefore, this week we are bringing forward new immigration rules to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route. Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.

Let me turn next to the action we are taking to ensure that every asylum hotel will be closed for good under this Government, not just by shifting individuals from hotels to other sites but by driving down the numbers in supported accommodation overall, and not in a chaotic way through piecemeal court judgments, but through a controlled, managed and orderly programme: driving down inflow into the asylum system, clearing the appeals backlog, which is crucial, and continuing to increase returns. Within the asylum estate, we are reconfiguring sites, increasing room sharing, tightening the test for accommodation and working at pace to identify alternative, cheaper and more appropriate accommodation with other Departments and with local authorities. We are increasing standards and security and joint public safety co-operation between the police, accommodation providers and the Home Office to ensure that laws and rules are enforced.

I understand and agree with local councils and communities who want the asylum hotels in their communities closed, because we need to close all asylum hotels—we need to do so for good—but that must be done in a controlled and orderly manner, not through a return to the previous Government's chaos that led to the opening of hotels in the first place.

Finally, let me update the House on the continued legal and controlled support that we will provide for those facing conflict and persecution. We will continue to do our bit to support Ukraine, extending the Ukraine permission extension scheme by a further 24 months, with further details to be set out in due course. We are also taking immediate action to rescue children who have been seriously injured in the horrendous onslaught on civilians in Gaza so that they can get the health treatment they need. The Foreign Secretary will update the House shortly on the progress to get those children out.

I confirm that the Home Office has put in place systems to issue expedited visas with biometric checks conducted prior to arrival for children and their immediate accompanying family members. We have done the same for all the Chevening scholars and are now in the process of doing so for the next group of students from Gaza who have been awarded fully funded scholarships and places at UK universities so that they can start their studies in autumn this year. Later this year, we will set out plans to establish a permanent framework for refugee students to come and study in the UK so that we can help more talented young people fleeing war and persecution to find a better future, alongside capped and managed ways for refugees to work here in the UK.

The Government are determined to fix every aspect of the broken system we inherited and to restore the confidence of the British people, solving problems, not exploiting them, with a serious and comprehensive plan, not fantasy claims based on sums that do not add up or gimmicks that failed in the past. What we will never do is seek to stir up chaos, division or hate, because that is not who we are as a country, and that is not what Britain stands for.

This is a practical plan to strengthen our border security, to fix the asylum chaos and to rebuild confidence in an asylum and immigration system that serves our national interests, protects our national security and reflects our national values. When we wave the Union flag, when we wave the St George's flag, when we sing ""God Save the King"" and when we celebrate everything that is great about Britain and about our country, we do so with pride because of the values that our flags, our King and our country represent: togetherness, fairness and decency, respect for each other and respect for the rule of law. That is what our country stands for. That is the British way to fix the problems we face. I commend this statement to the House.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Big_Ben_from_the_Westminster_Bridge.jpg/640px-Big_Ben_from_the_Westminster_Bridge.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 19:56:19.990980

Facing criticism for being on the back foot after a summer of protest outside asylum hotels, they were keen to defend their record and get back on track - but is it too late?

Politics latest: Cooper to suspend family reunion rules for asylum seekers

It's a clear nod to the political void Reform UK has seized on while the prime minister has been on holiday.

Last week, Nigel Farage unveiled his party's mass deportation policy - though the issue of women and children still seems to be worked out.

But perhaps none of that matters as voters overwhelmingly believe Reform cares about this issue - and as Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, pointed out on Monday, voters have lost confidence in the government somewhat to solve what many see as an immigration crisis on their doorstep.

So it's clear the strategy has changed from the government.

Johnson spoke in front of a spirited crowd of several hundred who marched in support of union workers and against the Trump administration. It followed a much quieter event over the weekend at City Hall, where the mayor signed an executive order called ""Protecting Chicago."" It reaffirms the city's Sanctuary City status and urges federal agents not to wear masks.

In the meantime, Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago is preparing to be the base of operations for more ICE agents.

Appearing on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, Noem confirmed that ramped-up immigration enforcement is coming to Illinois but stopped short of saying that the National Guard is coming, too.

""I think it goes hand in hand that first, agents would be sent here in hopes by the administration that an incident erupts to further justify Trump calling our National Guard,"" said Rep. Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, D-Illinois' 4th District.

In a statement published to the social media platform X on the evening of Aug. 31, the same day as the judge's decision, the Guatemalan government indicated it wanted to prevent the children from staying in shelters and detention centers and that it supports coordinated action to reunify Guatemalan children with their families.

The Guatemalan government has plans to identify the needs of each of the Guatemalan children and intends to include them in social programs in their home country, the government stated. All actions that have been taken in regards to the unaccompanied minors have taken the children's human rights into account and have complied with due process, the government alleged.

NPR asked the Guatemalan government how many children it had requested be returned from the U.S., and whether all of their parents have asked that the children be returned to Guatemala, as a U.S. attorney indicated in a hearing on Aug. 31. The Guatemalan government did not immediately respond and did not directly address those questions in its statement.

The statement appears to contain a factual error. The Guatemalan government said it suggested the idea of sending back the unaccompanied minors to Noem while she was in the country in July. But Noem visited Guatemala on June 26, after making stops in Costa Rica, Honduras and Paraguay in a tour of Central America.

During that visit, Noem and Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez signed agreements, including one to potentially allow people not originally from Guatemala to seek asylum in Guatemala instead of the U.S., despite the fact that U.S. law permits asylum seekers to remain as they comply with court proceedings relevant to their case. Noem was also pictured on June 26 watching people being deported from the U.S. while at La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, with U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Tobin Bradley.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NPR regarding whether Guatemala had suggested that the unaccompanied minors be returned to Guatemala while Noem was visiting the country in June.

Some attorneys representing the Guatemalan children set to be deported disagree with Guatemala's statement that the process to remove the unaccompanied minors has not disregarded their rights. In the attempt to send children away without allowing them to first finish pursuing their asylum claims, lawyers for the National Immigration Law Center, the law firm representing some of the Guatemalan children in the U.S., believe the U.S. has violated both federal laws and the U.S. constitution.

The ""Workers Over Billionaires"" protest kicked off near the Haymarket Memorial in the West Loop.

The protest's original purpose was to stand united against President Trump's cuts to funding and programs, and attacks on immigrants and minority communities.

But the recent threats made by President Trump to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, and plans confirmed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to escalate immigration enforcement in the city, made the message bigger.

""No federal troops in the city of Chicago!"" Mayor Brandon Johnson declared at the rally.

Johnson's message to the administration was loud and clear.

Among those echoing the message that troops under the command of the Trump administration are not welcome in Chicago was U.S. Rep. Jesús ""Chuy"" García, who is concerned that the Trump administration will try to exploit the upcoming Mexican Independence Day Parade.

That’s harmful to public safety because people may be afraid to reach out to law enforcement.","Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser paid a visit to Northwest Colorado last month, attending the 2025 Colorado Water Congress Summer Water Conference in Steamboat Springs.

During his visit, Weiser sat down with the Steamboat Pilot & Today to discuss his 2026 campaign for Colorado governor, as well as several pressing issues affecting Routt and Moffat County residents.

Specifically for Colorado’s Western Slope, Weiser said protecting water rights was top-of-mind.

With about 80% of the state’s water found on the Western Slope , Weiser said it’s imperative that water management “works for our whole state.”

“If we don’t protect water in communities in Colorado, they won’t have a future,” said Weiser.

Weiser noted that protecting forest health goes hand-in-hand with water management, with both issues having a “close climate connection.”

“Having a proactive commitment to how we protect our land, air and water is crucial to this part of the state,” he added.

In addition to protecting Northwest Colorado’s natural resources, Weiser said he is focused on improving youth mental health, not just in the region, but across the state.

While visiting the area, Weiser met with the Craig-Scheckman Family Foundation , a Steamboat-based youth advocacy organization, noting that the foundation’s work on youth mental health is a “model for the whole state.”

“Young people all across Colorado are really hurting,” he said. “There are a lot of indications of those challenges. This community — with incredible on-the-ground work — … It’s inspiring, and it’s pretty special.”

Weiser also noted the importance of providing support to those communities affected by the upcoming closures of the Routt and Moffat County coal plants.

“I care deeply about ensuring a just transition as those plants are closed …,” said Weiser. “We need to make sure that we are investing in these communities and that people here have a future in Northwest Colorado. I believe a core part of that has to be collaboration between Steamboat Springs, Hayden and Craig.”

Weiser also addressed the increase in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Colorado, emphasizing the seriousness of enforcing state law as it pertains to local law enforcement jurisdictions.

“Colorado law is very clear,” said Weiser. “Colorado law enforcement does law enforcement, not immigration enforcement.”

“We have a shortage of law enforcement resources,” he added. “We cannot allow our law enforcement to be diverted or coerced by the federal government to do their job.”

As attorney general, Weiser filed a lawsuit against a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who shared a 19-year-old student’s immigration status with ICE in June, according to reporting by the Colorado Sun.

Local law enforcement agencies are barred by state law from coordinating with ICE, something that Weiser plans on continuing to enforce as governor.

Weiser noted that everyone in Colorado should feel safe to contact law enforcement if they are the victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, regardless of immigration status.

“We should be aware of what’s causing this, which is we have a lawless, bullying administration in Washington that has embarked on campaigns designed to intimidate people,” Wesier said.

“What we are seeing at the federal level is not responsible immigration enforcement,” he continued. “What we’re seeing are intimidation campaigns designed to provide fear. That’s harmful to public safety because people may be afraid to reach out to law enforcement. It’s harmful to our future.”

During his time serving as Colorado’s attorney general, Weiser has filed 35 lawsuits against the Trump Administration, and noted that each lawsuit involves a “harmful” violation against the people of Colorado.

Weiser emphasized the weight of President Trump’s January attempt to repeal birthright citizenship, calling it “repulsive to the First Amendment,” as well as his March executive order suspending large U.S. law firms from security clearances and federal resources.

“I find both of those actions egregious and a front to our constitutional freedoms,” he said.

“This administration, time after time after time, has said about AmeriCorps funding, education funding, mental health funding, ‘We’re just not going to give out money that Congress mandated that we give out,'” Weiser continued. “It is a blatant violation of the law.”

Looking back on Gov. Jared Polis’ run in office, Weiser said he respected the governor’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, commending him for his respect of local control and “hard-headed, data-driven thinking.”

Moving forward, Weiser wants to continue to fight the “threat of social media,” something that he and Polis disagree on.

In 2023, Weiser, along with dozens of other states, sued Meta for the exploitation of young users for profit. Earlier this year, Weiser pushed for a bill that would establish social media requirements to protect users, particularly minors. Polis vetoed the bill in April.

“As governor, I’ll sign it,” said Wesier.

“We need governors who bring moral clarity on what our values are and what we’re fighting for,” he continued.

When asked about his confidence in the judicial branch remaining untouched by politics, Weiser said he held some worries, but continues to have faith that the federal court system will continue to be a place where law and order are kept.

“I’m concerned about the integrity and effectiveness of our judiciary given a range of factors,” Weiser said. “I’m also someone who’s hopeful … I see many of these cases as so clearly beyond the pale, but I do believe that the Supreme Court will uphold the rule of law.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2025/08/19140954/AG-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 17:56:58.459847

All She Wrote

New Mexico has three ICE detention centers in Otero, Torrance and Cibola counties. The governor is considering a bill to ban immigration detention facilities during an upcoming special legislative session.

Understandably, local governments want to protect these sources of jobs and revenue, but detention centers aren’t your regular, accessible employer. They receive our tax dollars to warehouse human beings, but if you expect responsibility and transparency, you’d be disappointed.

And, of course, they’re politicized. Democrats see hellholes; Republicans see summer camps. What’s the public to make of this?

In recent reporting Patrick Lohmann of Source New Mexico dug beneath the rhetoric following a tour of the Otero County Processing Center by some members of the legislative Courts, Corrections and Criminal Justice Committee.

The August 25 tour was supposed to be a committee activity. Chairman Joseph Cervantes, D-Las Cruces, had worked for months with Otero County’s lobbyist, former Rep. Zach Cook, a Republican, to arrange a tour for the committee. Cook assured him a tour was in the works, but as the date approached Cook wasn’t hearing back from ICE. Cervantes canceled the tour.

Days later, Sen. Crystal Brantley, R-Elephant Butte, arranged a visit when U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was visiting the state. Brantley asked federal officials why the committee hadn’t received permission to visit the facility, and they said they had no request on record to visit the facility.

By this time, the committee schedule was finalized, and Brantley’s tour became “unofficial.”

Eight Republicans and one Democrat, Rep. Andrea Romero of Santa Fe, toured the state’s biggest immigration detention center. They weren’t allowed to speak to detainees. Republicans saw a clean, humane, safe facility with a law library, dental and mental health care, exercise equipment, and computers. They noted the potential loss of 300 jobs and gross receipts tax revenues.

In a news release Brantley said: “ICE will do their job no matter what. Our choice is simple: a clean, safe, and accountable facility here, or one where we have no say in how detained migrants are treated.”

Romero saw hundreds of inmates “who just look absolutely in despair,” sitting or lying on their beds. Recreation equipment was locked up. She was the only one asking about due process, legal representation, and how quickly detainees are deported.

Romero told Lohmann she hoped other elected officials “get an opportunity to really see these places, because it shouldn’t just be one person trying to decipher what’s actually happening. We need to have a lot of transparency around people’s rights, around who we detain, and for what reason.”

Both legislators make good points. Corrections facilities are often the best and sometimes the only job options in rural counties. And wouldn’t we rather have ICE facilities in a state that cares about conditions?

But the question of transparency looms over everything. Why should Cervantes and even Brantley have to go to such lengths for a tour? They are elected officials who want to lay eyes on a facility that receives massive amounts of taxpayer money. If the detention centers are as good as their supporters claim they should welcome the visits.

But it’s ICE we’re talking about here. Police wear uniforms but not masks, catch criminals, and are accountable for what they do. Masked ICE agents dressed in street clothes are supposed to be catching criminals, but instead they prey on moms and dads, restaurant and agricultural workers, students, Dreamers, U.S. citizens, green card holders, and pretty much anybody with brown skin. Arrests are often so violent that detainees are injured.

When U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez visited at the end of July, Otero’s average daily population was 843, and more than 80% had no criminal charges or convictions. This compares to 71% nationally, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Vasquez was not allowed to speak to detainees, and jailers wouldn’t answer questions about their treatment. He said their phones were broken, and toilets wouldn’t flush. Staff members of U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich visited the Torrance County Detention Center, with 435 detainees, in late May and reported terrible conditions. Nobody has seen the Cibola County Detention Center, population 227, since January 2024.

New Mexico is not an outlier. The feds now have new guidelines that require advance notice for oversight visits and make some facilities off limits—even though the law says members of Congress are not required to provide advance notice. In July a dozen U.S. House Democrats sued. Vasquez has his own bill about ICE detention transparency and treatment.

When New Mexico legislators examine these detention centers, they will weigh jobs and revenue, but they must also assess the state’s role in this increasingly unpopular human roundup.",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,,2025-09-01 17:57:07.804556

“The system has to be controlled and managed based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs,” she said.

UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced on Monday that she was “temporarily” suspending new applications to the refugee family reunion route as the government draws up new rules set to be introduced by spring next year.

“The system has to be controlled and managed based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs,” she said.

Under the current system, an asylum seeker granted indefinite leave to remain in the country can bring in children under the age of 18, and their partner if they can prove they have been in a relationship for at least two years.

Cooper told Parliament that increasing numbers of family reunion applications had placed pressure on housing across the country, with many applying to bring relatives over within about a month. One of the planned reforms would mean longer waiting periods before applying.

Refugee charities blasted the move. Safe Passage, which supports child refugees, accused the government of “giving in to far-right pressure”, saying that it would leave children fleeing war and persecution in countries like Afghanistan, Sudan or Iran “trapped in danger”.

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Far from stopping people taking dangerous journeys to cross the Channel, these changes will only push more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones.”

Far right whipping up anger

Cooper announced the move as Labour faced a bumpy return to Parliament after a summer break that has seen anti-immigration protesters repeatedly targeting hotels housing asylum seekers in various parts of England – most recently in Epping, northeast of London, on Sunday.

Facing pressure from Nigel Farage’s hard-right Reform UK party, which has whipped up anger over people arriving in small boats over the English Channel from France, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday that he will accelerate plans to empty the asylum hotels.

Accused of moving too slowly, the government has been eager to demonstrate it is tackling a problem left by previous Conservative-led administrations by brokering return deals with other nations and speeding up the processing of asylum claims.

Cooper said that the UK and France will start implementing a “one in, one out” pilot scheme later this month, with the former sending refugees and asylum seekers to the latter in exchange for approved applicants.

“Applications have also been opened for the reciprocal legal route, with the first cases under consideration subject to strict security checks,” she said, adding that “family groups” would be prioritised under the deal with France.

The government will also establish a new independent body to deal with appeals as tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently awaiting a decision, Cooper said.

Mr Norton then appealed to the county court, but HHJ Saggerson dismissed his argument that a lawful assessment under section 189A and a lawful personal housing plan were pre-conditions of a valid suitability decision.
HHJ Saggerson said section 189A did not impose any obligations on a reviewing officer - although it could have done - and did not provide that an assessment of suitability is unlawful in the absence of a section 189A assessment.
The application for permission to appeal was lodged with the Supreme Court last month.","A claimant has applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal in a dispute over whether a local housing authority is precluded from determining the suitability of offered accommodation if it has not prepared a lawful section 189A(1) assessment, and the further documentation required by that section.

In June this year the Court of Appeal found that Parliament could not have intended that an otherwise lawful offer of accommodation by a local authority could be invalidated for lack of an assessment under section 189A(1) of the Housing Act 1996.

Lord Justice Lewison said section 189A provided that a local authority must make an assessment of the applicant's case if it is satisfied they are homeless or threatened with homelessness and eligible for assistance.

Applicant Thomas Norton complained the accommodation he was offered was unsuitable and asked for a review of Haringey's decision.

The reviewing officer rejected his complaints and Mr Norton's solicitors said no lawful decision on the suitability of the accommodation could be made in the absence of a lawful housing needs section 189A assessment.

HHJ Saggerson said section 189A did not impose any obligations on a reviewing officer - although it could have done - and did not provide that an assessment of suitability is unlawful in the absence of a section 189A assessment.

He said the acid test was whether the reviewing officer had sufficient comprehensive information on which to make a determination.

Mr Norton then appealed, but the Court of Appeal upheld HHJ Saggerson’s decision.

Lord Justice Lewison said Mr Norton “has lost nothing of value” having received the decision on suitability to which he was entitled and which contained no legal flaw.

“In my judgment the consequences of holding that compliance with the duty under section 189A is a condition precedent are stark; and unlikely to reflect Parliament's intention,” Lewison LJ said.

Rwanda and Uganda have also reached agreements with the Trump administration to receive deportees.","A small African nation currently imprisoning five immigrants deported from the United States reportedly asked the Trump administration for half a billion dollars to detain them.

The administration resumed a policy of deporting immigrant detainees to so-called third countries in July, starting with the tiny African nation of Eswatini. Eswatini’s government at one point requested millions of dollars in exchange, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.

Those documents also show that Eswatini was open to detaining 150 people from other nations for more than $10 million from the United States, the newspaper reported.

Eswatini diplomats told The Independent in July that they were blindsided by the Trump administration’s plan to send a group of men with criminal convictions to their country; they had only learned about the flights from social media.

Eswatini officials said they plan to arrange for those detainees to be sent back to their countries of origin, while activists in the country are challenging what they say is an unconstitutional secret agreement with the Trump administration.

The Eswatini government said the men “will be repatriated” and the United Nations International Organization for Migration is working with the country to “facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.”

Nearly two months later, those men remain imprisoned in Eswatini.

Officials there had also asked whether the United States expected the deportees to be put on trial and sentenced by local officials once they arrived, according to The Times.

The Independent has requested comment from Homeland Security, Eswatini officials and the UN’s International Organization for Migration for comment.

One of those deported men, Orville Etoria, had completed a prison sentence in 2021 after he was convicted of murder in New York in 1996. He was deported to Eswatini in July, and he is reportedly locked up in Matsapha Correctional Complex despite not facing any new criminal charges.

The Jamaican citizen arrived in the United States on a green card in 1976 at age 12, but an immigration judge revoked his permissions while he was incarcerated. After he was released, he was allowed to legally live and work in the country on the condition that he complete regular check-in appointments with immigration authorities.

The 62-year-old completed a bachelor’s degree while behind bars, then began working at a men’s shelter and pursued a master’s degree in divinity after his release, The Times reported.

Homeland Security officials labeled Etoria and the other men sent to Eswatini “depraved monsters” who are “so uniquely barbaric” that those countries won’t accept them.

Jamaican officials rejected the administration’s claim that the country is not cooperating.

“The Government has not refused the return of any of our nationals to Jamaica,” according to Jamaican foreign minister Kamina J Smith.

Jamaica will “continue its engagements” with the Trump administration to make arrangements “to facilitate the individual’s return to Jamaica,” she wrote in July.

Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a land-locked nation of roughly 1.2 million people, bordered by South Africa on virtually all sides and by the southern tip of Mozambique to the east. Its government is the last absolute monarchy on the continent.

The government has failed to investigate extrajudicial killings, journalists and dissidents face threats of arbitrary arrests and detentions, and detainees are “subjected to torture and other ill-treatment,” according to Amnesty International.

Trump’s own State Department tells travelers to “exercise increased caution in Eswatini due to crime and civil unrest.”

Critics and civil rights attorneys have argued that the administration is unnecessarily putting immigrants at severe risk of abuse and violence by sending them to so-called “third countries” where they do not have citizenship, family or any other connections.

A June decision from the Supreme Court opened the door for government officials to send deportees to those countries, including places with poor human rights records and no due process.

The Eswatini flight appeared to be the first successful third-country deportation after Immigration and Customs Enforcement told officials that migrants can be deported from the United States to countries other than their own with as little as six hours’ notice — or no notice at all.

Countries that provide “diplomatic assurances” that they won’t face torture and abuse could be deported without any advance notice, according to the memo. If the State Department believes those assurances are “credible,” then ICE may deport someone to that country “without the need for further procedures.”

Since taking office, the Trump administration has held hundreds of immigrants at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and deported dozens of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, which marked the administration’s first arrangement of third-country removals.

After a weeks-long legal battle, the administration deported eight men to war-torn South Sudan in July, though only one of them is from that country.

They remain incarcerated there while South Sudan officials negotiate efforts to send them to their home countries.

Rwanda and Uganda have also reached agreements with the Trump administration to receive deportees. At least seven deportees arrived in Rwanda last month, according of officials there.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/01/17/51/Eswatini-government-faces-court-challenge-for-accepting-U-S--deportees-f2y0j96y.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-01 16:56:25.062106

Tjan,,,,,https://www.lawcommentary.com/articles/federal-appeals-court-rules-trump-overstepped-authority-on-tariffs-leaving-policy-in-legal-jeopardy,"The appellate panel concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the statute on which Trump relied, does not grant presidents unlimited authority to impose tariffs.
The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacted in 1977, allows presidents to regulate commerce in response to extraordinary foreign threats.
The law is typically used to impose economic sanctions, freeze assets, or restrict financial transactions during crises such as terrorism or arms proliferation.
Legal Analysis: The Major Questions Doctrine The Federal Circuit’s reasoning mirrors the Supreme Court’s growing reliance on the major questions doctrine.
By applying this reasoning, the court aligned itself with a conservative legal trend that narrows executive discretion on matters of major economic importance.","A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when he invoked national emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every country, dealing a major blow to one of his signature economic policies.

In a 7–4 decision issued on Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit largely upheld a May ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, which struck down the tariffs as unlawful. The appellate panel concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the statute on which Trump relied, does not grant presidents unlimited authority to impose tariffs. Instead, the court said, the Constitution places the power to levy import duties squarely in Congress’s hands.

“The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs,” the court wrote, emphasizing that prior administrations had used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not broad trade restrictions.

While affirming that the tariffs exceeded Trump’s statutory authority, the appeals court declined to immediately freeze them. The panel sent the case back to the trade court to reconsider whether a nationwide injunction against the tariffs is appropriate, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent guidance limiting the use of universal injunctions.

Trump, who has repeatedly defended tariffs as vital to restoring American manufacturing and creating leverage in international negotiations, blasted the ruling as “highly partisan” in a Truth Social post. He noted that the duties remain in effect while his administration considers an appeal to the Supreme Court.

The split decision revealed partisan divisions within the judiciary. Six of the seven judges in the majority were appointed by Democratic presidents, along with one appointee of George H.W. Bush. Of the four dissenters, two were appointed by Barack Obama and two by George W. Bush.

Trump has leaned heavily on tariffs since returning to office. In April, he rolled out what he called “reciprocal tariffs” against dozens of trading partners on “Liberation Day,” though many were later paused for negotiations. Earlier this month, he announced a new wave of duties on more than 60 countries, in some cases securing agreements that lowered the rates but still left them above pre-“Liberation Day” levels.

Supporters argue that tariffs are necessary to counter unfair trade practices, reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing, and generate billions in federal revenue. Trump has also tied tariff threats to non-economic issues, using them to pressure China over fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, and India over its trade ties with Russia.

Critics, however, contend that the tariffs harm U.S. consumers and businesses by raising prices and slowing growth. Many economists warn that steep duties could undermine the broader economy, while legal experts argue that Trump’s expansive use of emergency powers raises constitutional concerns. Some lawsuits against the tariffs cite the “major questions doctrine,” a legal principle often championed by conservative judges that limits executive action on issues of broad political or economic significance without explicit congressional approval.

What is IEEPA?

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacted in 1977, allows presidents to regulate commerce in response to extraordinary foreign threats. The law is typically used to impose economic sanctions, freeze assets, or restrict financial transactions during crises such as terrorism or arms proliferation. It has rarely been used to alter tariff policy. Courts have now signaled that Congress did not intend IEEPA to serve as a blank check for presidents to rewrite trade policy, particularly given that the Constitution reserves taxing and tariff powers to the legislative branch.

Legal Analysis: The Major Questions Doctrine

The Federal Circuit’s reasoning mirrors the Supreme Court’s growing reliance on the major questions doctrine. That doctrine holds that when an agency, or in this case, the president, takes action with sweeping political and economic consequences, Congress must have clearly authorized it in statutory text. Without explicit language, courts presume the executive lacks such broad authority.

The Supreme Court has applied this doctrine in recent high-profile cases, such as West Virginia v. EPA (2022), where it struck down the Environmental Protection Agency’s attempt to impose wide-ranging climate regulations without clear congressional authorization. Similarly, in the tariff case, the appeals court emphasized that IEEPA does not mention tariffs at all, nor does it contain safeguards for imposing them. By applying this reasoning, the court aligned itself with a conservative legal trend that narrows executive discretion on matters of major economic importance.

Notably, the doctrine can cut both ways politically. While it has often been invoked by conservatives to block expansive regulatory action by Democratic administrations, here it was used to rein in a Republican president’s trade agenda. The case underscores that the doctrine is less about partisan politics than about separation of powers, raising fundamental questions about how far presidents of either party may stretch vague statutory language to reshape economic policy.",https://www.lawcommentary.com/img/articles/uFLDhyvVllor8bRvuzWG4tVFNETFCr5xLE0af2F1.png?fit=crop&h=630&w=1200&signature=7fd992435d72ae8d77ee7d08788ea383aa022635af13968ae3e01b8923390d55,N,,2025-09-01 18:57:06.506986

The phenomenon, known as ""reverse flow"" migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country's long-running economic, social and political crises only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.

Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.

Friday's report, published with support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97 per cent this year. Migrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia by those countries' ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%) and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally reach the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the crisis in Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and more. That changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.

A U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Then thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.

In this country, a judge has blocked the United States from deporting as many as 600 Guatemalan children. Here's NPR's Chiara Eisner.

CHIARA EISNER, BYLINE: Minors who enter the U.S. unaccompanied are not allowed to be deported without first having the full opportunity to apply for legal status. But on Sunday, planes were loaded with Guatemalan children who had crossed the border alone.

EFREN OLIVARES: We know that there were two planes in Harlingen, Texas, and one plane in El Paso, Texas. And that is from reports of people on the ground, physically at the airport, who saw these planes and the children being loaded onto the planes.

EISNER: That's Efren Olivares with the National Immigration Law Center, the U.S. firm defending some of the Guatemalan children. The children's lawyers scrambled to petition the U.S. government to stop them from being removed, and on Sunday morning, a federal judge temporarily halted the planes. The U.S. government argued Guatemala had asked for the children's return and said their parents had also requested their removal from the country. Attorneys for the children said their clients hadn't completed asylum proceedings. Here's a lawyer who was involved with the case, Becky Wolozin. She's a senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law.

BECKY WOLOZIN: They're clearly targeting children based exclusively on their national origin, which is also unlawful.

EISNER: Then Sunday evening, the Guatemalan government posted a statement to X. It was Guatemala that had suggested that the Guatemalan children should be sent to that country. No human rights had been violated, and all due process had been followed. Here's Kika Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.

KICA MATOS: This idea that on a long weekend in the dead of night, they would wake up these vulnerable children and put them on a plane is something that should shock the conscience of all Americans.

EISNER: NPR asked DHS and the Guatemalan government for comment. Neither responded.

Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.

But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.

""This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.

On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post, calling the appeals court ""Highly Partisan"" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.

Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.

Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.

How did the dispute arise?

Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.

The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.

Mr. Trump on April 2 — or Liberation Day, he called it — imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.

The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. — and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did — including the U.K., Japan and the EU — and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.

Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.

What is the IEEPA?

Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits ""a national emergency.""

In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs — and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.

Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?

No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.

Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.

The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.

In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs ""exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges — one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states — into a single case.

On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that ""it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.""

What happens next?

The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.

A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions ""is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,"" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.

The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.

Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.

The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for the U.S.

It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.

""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.

Does the Trump administration have other options?

Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.

For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.

The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.

""Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,"" noted Green of the deVere Group.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/29/80766fac-bbf3-496c-9007-dc73f0ad5b7a/thumbnail/1200x630/4a2d4bfdf1d3d15d85e227538edb22dc/cbsn-fusion-most-trumps-tariffs-illegal-federal-appeals-court-rules-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 14:56:46.434576

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer.
About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.","It's tomato season and Lidia is harvesting on farms in California's Central Valley.

She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.

“The worry is they’ll pull you over when you’re driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”

As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation's labor force.

More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”

Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”

'Crops did go to waste’

Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.

In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.

“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.

Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,"" said Lidia. ""I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”

From construction to health care

Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.

“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.""

The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”

Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.

“What’s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?"" De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren’t in the field to pick our crops? Who’s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?” ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

A few blocks away, the scene was louder and more charged: demonstrators with megaphones chanted outside the Holiday Inn near the Long Beach airport, while police officers stood guard near the front of the establishment.

Word had spread through social media that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had reportedly checked into both hotels. Within the hour, a small contingent of local residents had arrived at both establishments. They were there to make sure ICE agents didn’t sleep.

This was one of several “No Sleep for ICE” events that popped up during the month of June. In a time when large-scale protests often dominate headlines, a different kind of resistance is taking root across Southern California. Small, decentralized networks of community members are using stealthy tactics and real-time coordination to monitor, disrupt, and expose the movements of federal immigration officers.

Across L.A. County, the strategy of monitoring ICE movements and responding in real time has become one of the most effective tools in rapid-response activism.

“They shouldn’t be kidnapping people off the street,” said Michael Gearin, a local Long Beach resident, who spoke to Truthout during the anti-ICE mobilization efforts in June.

​​“If [ICE] wants to come back after a day of kidnapping landscapers and want to kick back and have a beer at the Residence Inn, I say no,” Gearin said, emphasizing his commitment to protecting his neighbors from immigration enforcement. “Why should they have an easy night when everybody else is scared?”

No Sleep For ICE is just one of several pop-up actions that have proliferated over the last several months throughout Southern California. As the immigration raids intensified from the start of June, leading into the late summer months, locals sought out increasingly creative ways to protect vulnerable community members. Many of these micro-movements rarely make the evening news, but they have become the core of mobilization efforts.

In the months leading up to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, grassroots organizers quietly prepared for an expected surge in immigration raids. Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona, an educator and member of Unión del Barrio, partook in community patrols that monitor and track the movements of immigration enforcement agents, alerting local residents in real time.

“[ICE] uses the element of surprise to their benefit,” Cardona told Truthout, noting that many ICE-spotting patrols go early in the morning and search neighborhoods looking for staging of potential agents. “We patrol to spot them, and then let them know we see them — go live on socials, announce to the whole community that they’re there.”

The efforts of local activists patrolling their neighborhoods have uncovered useful information. In June, local groups of organizers monitoring ICE activity discovered that Terminal Island in San Pedro is being used by ICE for early-morning staging and dispatching throughout LA County. This piece of critical information made it easier to monitor ICE activity and warn communities before a raid even begins.

Cardona also noted that community defense patrols have uncovered tactics used by immigration enforcement agents to evade detection. “We’ve uncovered that ICE is switching license plates, using incorrect ones, and sometimes coming out with no plates at all.”

Community patrol work has deep roots in Southern California, stemming back to the early 90s, mostly along the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. Many activists there were inspired by the Black Panther Party’s model of community patrols, and Unión del Barrio adapted the concept to monitor and protect immigrant communities from immigration enforcement.

The recent iterations of patrol efforts in Los Angeles were revived in 2020 as a response to raids occurring under the Biden administration. By the time the second Trump administration took office, Unión del Barrio had already built critical experience. Recognizing the magnitude of the task at hand, the group launched the Community Self-Defense Coalition in 2025. The coalition now includes over 60 organizations spanning Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and even parts of Northern California.

Ron Gochez, another seasoned organizer with Unión del Barrio, said that in addition to conducting patrols, the coalition has developed a training program specifically for schools. The curriculum is designed to help educators protect their students, their students’ families, and themselves during potential encounters with immigration enforcement agents.

“We’ve really been focusing on educators, because we know schools are about to start again,” said Gochez. “Educators are on the frontlines of defending their students and families.”

Most recently, the coalition conducted a training with over 250 LAUSD educators at the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) building in collaboration with the teachers’ union. “We did a training for 250 people … because we know what’s coming, and we’re preparing together,” Gochez stated.

Gochez says the effectiveness of localized organizing has forced immigration authorities to adapt. “The entire ICE apparatus had to change their tactics because of our work.”

Despite a wave of local support for grassroots mobilization, activists say federal authorities have responded with intimidation and threats aimed at curbing their ongoing efforts.

In June, Unión del Barrio received a letter addressed to Gochez from Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who identified himself as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism. In the letter, Hawley accused the organization of providing “logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions” during protests taking place in Los Angeles at the time. He further alleged that Unión del Barrio had bankrolled civil unrest and abetted criminal behavior, and demanded that the group cease all organized activity.

The letter also included a sweeping request for internal records, including communications, emails, chat logs, donor lists, travel and lodging documents, and any evidence of coordination with members of the media.

“We’re not going to let a neocolonial government like the United States intimidate us,” Gochez said in response to the letter. Both he and fellow member Cardona described the correspondence as a “veiled threat” and an effort to intimidate the collective. Still, they said the group remains undeterred, and that the letter has generated more interest and support for their work.

Other grassroots organizations have faced similar threats at the federal level, as was the case with Alejandro Orellana, a 29-year-old immigrant rights advocate with Centro CSO. Orellana was arrested by the FBI in June and charged with “conspiracy to commit civil disorder” after allegedly distributing face shields to protesters during a June 9 demonstration in downtown Los Angeles.

Although the Department of Justice later dismissed all charges, advocates view the arrest as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and suppress grassroots organizing, like the work being carried out by Centro CSO and Unión del Barrio.

Similarly, a member of Unión del Barrio was arrested recently at Terminal Island while monitoring the movement of federal vehicles alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol. Amanda Trebach, a U.S. citizen, was seized by several masked individuals who did not identify themselves as federal agents while on a morning peace patrol.

Video of the incident was shared widely online — Trebach was pinned face-down, with a knee on the back of her neck, before she was taken away in an unmarked van. She was held overnight in federal custody and released the following day without any charges filed.

While large protests still play a vital role in public awareness, these smaller, quieter efforts continue to shape what organizers see as a new front line. Whether it is the “disruptive work” of No Sleep for ICE, Know-Your-Rights Workshops, or patrolling neighborhoods, organizers are now two steps ahead. Rather than waiting to respond, locals are taking a proactive approach to defending their community.

“We don’t have the luxury to stop, because our people depend on our resistance,” said Gochez.

The shift reflects a broader recalibration in immigrant defense work, one that sends a clear message: we will not be intimidated.

Gochez describes the work of local organizing in Southern California as a sophisticated and efficient network of community members united by a deep commitment to defending one another.

“We’re not just a protest group … we’re not just a group that goes out and does marches,” he says. Rather, the group also engages in “organized resistance, coalitions, training people, tactics, and strategies that are proven to work.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Long-Beach1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 12:57:05.687600

From citrus farms in the Central Valley to construction sites where homes and businesses are being rebuilt after devastating wildfires in Pacific Palisades, California relies heavily on immigrant workers and entrepreneurs.

As the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, industries key to the state's $4 trillion economy like agriculture, construction and hospitality could be among those hardest hit by the loss of California's immigrant workforce, according to new research.

At stake are billions of dollars that fuel businesses large and small across the state, whose standalone economy is the fourth largest in the world after the United States, China and Germany.

Approximately one-fifth of the state's 10.6 million immigrants are undocumented, according to a June study from the nonpartisan Bay Area Economic Institute and the University of California, Merced.

If mass deportations were to be combined with the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants and stricter border policies, the joint study estimated that California would be at risk of losing as much as $278 billion from its gross domestic product.

Immigrant workers have been essential in bolstering the state's economy given declining birthrates and an aging population, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute.

""These are the workers that are keeping our economy afloat. They're keeping businesses open,"" Raisz told CNBC.

One of the places that is most evident is in the fields where food is grown and harvested, researchers and advocates say.

Agriculture, a $49 billion industry for the state, has the highest concentration of immigrant and undocumented immigrant workers in California, with 63% of them immigrants and 24% of farm workers undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.

""Without them, we wouldn't have any food available,"" said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects farmworkers to growers.

""The lettuce, the strawberries, all the wine we drink on a daily basis, fruit juices– everything that a farmworker picks, packs, pre-harvest– they do the jobs all year round that put food on your table,"" he said.

Garcia added that automation isn't an option for many of these positions, and American-born workers are not interested in taking on these jobs, which are often strenuous, low-paid and outdoors.

The Trump administration insists that the domestic labor market can withstand a shortage of immigrant labor, and says its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens.

""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,"" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry from CNBC about the potential impact of mass deportations on California and its key industries.

""There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.""

ICE impacts

In downtown Los Angeles, businesses have felt waves of impact in June and beyond due to high-profile ICE raids, accompanying protests and National Guard Deployment, owners and advocates said, exacerbating a public perception issue that downtown Los Angeles is not safe.

The Independent Hospitality Coalition, which represents some 900 local businesses and workers in the Los Angeles Area, said the raids struck fear into the immigrant workforce and created a challenging atmosphere for businesses that were already faced with several years of uphill battles.

""COVID, it was an international emergency that we were all dealing with. Here in California, especially here in Los Angeles, with the recent Palisades and Altadena fires… now it's immigration situation that we're dealing with. It's more like a localized COVID all over again,"" said Eddie Navarette, executive director of the hospitality commission.

Courtney Kaplan owns three Los Angeles restaurants, including Camelia in the downtown Arts District. She saw a 70 percent drop in sales in June alone, she told CNBC, due to closures and curfews, even though she is not in close proximity to where protests or the National Guard deployments took place.

Her staff continue to come to work, but the uncertainty around both immigration and trade policy, as she relies on imported wines and sake, weigh on her. Data from OpenTable show a drop in dining reservations for all of Los Angeles were down from June 7th through the 21st by 3% year on year.

""The biggest challenge for us, aside from the lost revenue and the decrease in business, has been the uncertainty of every day. It's been so unpredictable. It's been chaotic,"" Kaplan told CNBC in July.

""We're still in the very early days of these changes to immigration policy, so it's hard to even predict what's coming. It just is a cause of concern that perhaps that down the line, the situation for us will change with our team members' comfort levels.""

Worker shortages

Sectors like construction and farming are staring down worker shortages that predate any change to immigration policy. In California, more than sixty percent of construction workers are immigrants and a quarter of them are undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.

""There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group.

""The way we've dealt with this over time has been immigration. Other cultures, cultures associated with other countries have different characteristics. Many more people there have been willing and wanting to be in the skilled trades, and we import that talent to improve our built environment.""

Contractors largely fall into two camps, he told CNBC. Some of them express confidence and support for Trump, believing the president's strategy will spur domestic manufacturing, investment and hiring. Others are pessimistic, as costs and uncertainty have risen.

Regardless of contractors' outlooks, said Basu, the nature of California's economy and its longstanding housing shortage mean that the state is constantly in need of construction workers.

The anti-immigration rallies held across the country yesterday have dominated coverage overnight, with a number of publications still leading on the events this morning.

The Age says “Melbourne’s CBD roiled with protest on Sunday as anti-immigration and counter-demonstrators clashed repeatedly, and a large number of police were stretched to cope with a shifting struggle that ranged through the city’s streets for more than four hours”.

The newspaper says police arrested six people and confirmed the use of capsicum spray and bean-bag guns “to prevent violence between protesters, some of whom were intent on creating conflict and violence”.

The BBC says protesters in Melbourne clashed with attendees of a separate pro-Palestine rally, while the AAP states this morning that “racism and extremism at anti-immigration rallies across Australia have been condemned after a score of arrests following violent clashes”, adding: “prominent neo-Nazis also gave speeches in Sydney and Melbourne”.

NSW Police estimated some 15,000 people attended the Sydney rally, while Victoria Police estimated the Melbourne crowd size to be 5,000, and Queensland Police reported about 6,000 protesters attended the Brisbane rally.

The AAP reports speakers and attendees “were at pains to state they were not against immigrants but wanted less migration. However, rhetoric crossed into racism and xenophobia and became conspiratorial for some”.

Meanwhile, Guardian Australia says while “the protests were condemned as hateful by the federal government”, some politicians attended the different rallies. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and Senator Malcolm Roberts attended the rally in Canberra, and federal MP Bob Katter was at the event in Townsville.

The site points out the marches on Sunday “were promoted by neo-Nazis, as well as anti-lockdown figures who gained prominence during the pandemic, and other fringe groups, but no group publicly claimed responsibility for organising the protests”.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said of the rallies: “There is no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion. We stand with modern Australia against these rallies — nothing could be less Australian.”

Anne Aly, the minister for multicultural affairs, also declared: “We stand with all Australians, no matter where they were born, against those who seek to divide us and who seek to intimidate migrant communities. We will not be intimidated. This brand of far-right activism, grounded in racism and ethnocentrism, has no place in modern Australia.”

SOCIAL MEDIA AGE VERIFICATION RISKS

The findings of the study into age assurance technology have been released by the federal government 100 days before its social media ban for under-16s comes into effect.

(Before we continue, I need to draw your attention to the latest episode of Crikey’s new Cut Through podcast, which involves associate editor Cam Wilson talking to host Crystal Andrew about where we’re at with the impending ban and the challenges to come.)

As the ABC reports, the study has found “it was technologically possible to assess a user’s age to a reasonable degree of confidence in a variety of ways, but that every way included risks and shortcomings”.

The study said letting social media platforms pick their own method of age verification could result in inconsistency. “Implementation depends on the willingness of a small number of dominant tech companies to enable or share control of [age assurance] processes,” the report says. “Coordination among dominant [tech] providers is essential if any truly ecosystem-wide age assurance model is to succeed.”

The broadcaster highlights Communications Minister Anika Wells and eSafety commissioner Julie Inman-Grant are set to reveal in the coming weeks the “reasonable steps” social media giants will need to take to comply with the ban.

Wells is quoted by The Conversation as saying of the trial’s results: “While there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to age assurance, this trial shows there are many effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded.”

The AAP points out more than 60 different age verification tools were assessed as part of the trial.

“Age assurance can be done in Australia,” the report states, adding: “However, the rapidly evolving threat environment means that these systems — while presently fairly robust — cannot be considered infallible.”

The newswire highlights the report also warned that some providers were currently collecting too much data on users. “We found some concerning evidence that in the absence of specific guidance, service providers were apparently over-anticipating the eventual needs of regulators about providing personal information for future investigations,” it said.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa last week lauded Australia’s plans to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, The Mandarin reports.

“The plasticity of their [young people’s] brains is being reshaped. If you’re always pumped full of dopamine, it’s like being permanently under drugs. Social media is awful for human rights,” she said. Ressa is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra today on the theme of “Facts. Truth. Trust”.

The federal politicians will also be in the capital for another sitting week of both houses of Parliament, with the social media ban likely to get attention. Net zero will also continue to feature (because, you know, the Coalition), with The Australian reporting this morning that Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has “urged opposition frontbencher Andrew Hastie against voting for his bill to abolish a ­commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050”.

The paper says: “Joyce warned Mr Hastie it would be counter­productive for him to support a private member’s bill to abolish the net-zero target, as it would lead the prominent conservative Liberal to be dumped from the shadow ministry and limit his ­impact on policy development”.

Hastie didn’t comment when contacted by the newspaper, and Joyce declared: “I don’t know where Andrew’s mind is at, that is his business”.

Meanwhile, the AAP informs us in a headline this morning, “It’s not me, it’s you: millions abandon the Coalition”…

ON A LIGHTER NOTE…

A bright orange shark has been discovered by fishermen near Tortuguero National Park in Costa Rica.

Scientists, who published pictures of the unusual creature in the Marine Biology journal last month, said it was the first time a shark of that colour had ever been seen, the BBC reports.

The colouring is caused by a condition called xanthism, which is when creatures lose dark skin pigments, resulting in a visible yellow or orange colouring.

Sport fishing guide and hotel owner Garvin Watson told The New York Times: “We saw an orange glow below the water and I said, ‘My God, what is this?’ We were all screaming like crazy.”

Watson posted pictures of the shark on social media last year, and it drew the attention of researchers who subsequently wrote up a paper on the discovery.

“I saw the photos and I was impressed,” marine biologist and executive director of Costa Rica’s Rescue Center for Endangered Marine Species Daniel Arauz Naranjo said. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is something strange.’”

Watson said he let the usual creature go after catching it, and, for reasons only he knows, kissed the shark and told it: “Thank you. We love you.”

Say What?

The world today is swept by once-in-a-century transformations. The international situation is both fluid and chaotic.

CRIKEY RECAP

New analysis of the 48th Parliament’s interests register by Crikey and Open Politics reveals MPs and their families have declared 451 properties, from primary residences and second homes in Canberra through to rental investment properties, holiday homes and beach houses.

Of the 226 members, 135 declared that they or their families own two or more properties, 69 own three or more properties, and 29 own four or more. Only 16 MPs, 7%, have declared owning no property at all. (For those counting, we’re missing a declaration from One Nation’s Warwick Stacey, who resigned earlier this month, and independent MP Bob Katter, who… simply hasn’t filed.)

In the table below, search by politician or party to see how many properties have been declared. These numbers are an undercount, as senators are not required to publicly disclose their families’ interests.

Dezi Freeman obsessively posted fantasies about killing and torturing police officers across social media platforms in the years leading up to the alleged shooting of two officers and the injury of another at Porepunkah this week.

Crikey has exclusively obtained seven years of Freeman’s private Facebook posts, dozens of Telegram messages and other previously unreported Instagram comments.

In just four months, social media platforms will be forced to ban kids aged 16 and under. How will that work? Well, that’s the thing… no-one actually knows.

Crikey associate editor and tech journalist Cam Wilson has been closely following the progress of the teen social media ban — from the push for a ban by commercial radio host Michael “Wippa” Wipfli, to rushed legislation, aggressive lobbying by the tech giants, and, now, a trial of age-verification technology that’s not quite going to plan.

He joins Cut Through host Crystal Andrews to explain what the hell is going on, and what you can expect when the results from the tech trial are made public.

THE COMMENTARIAT

Albanese government resorts to whatever-it-takes to rid Australia of former detainees — Michelle Grattan (The Conversation): It is fortunate for the government that the opposition is backing the latest legislation. If the government had needed the Greens to pass the legislation, it would probably be facing defeat.

The Greens condemned the Nauru deal. Their immigration spokesman David Shoebridge said: “At a time when we should be building partnerships in the Pacific based on equality and respect, the government is instead forcing our smaller neighbours to become 21st-century prison colonies.”

Over many years, Labor in opposition was highly critical of the Coalition’s handling of issues dealing with illegal immigrants.

The Australian concept of a ‘fair go’ is a furphy — especially when it comes to tax, education and care — Julianne Schultz (Guardian Australia): Disappointment in the failure to realise the good ideals once promised in “the land of the fair go” have transferred from one generation to the next and are now informing the overwhelmingly progressive politics of those under 40. In raw political terms, Chalmers is right; younger voters will be the ones who will determine his future.

For years Australian policymakers and politicians thought they could square the circle: a market-driven economy with a robust social safety net.

But as an immigrant from Mexico living in the community, she knows that ICE is not well-received in Charlotte generally, she said. She has defended controversial arrests and the use of face coverings by ICE agents, saying they fear being doxxed.

“Almost everyone has this impression or this mindset that ICE is bad,” she said. “You guys, we do a lot of good for the community.”

Specifically, she said, ICE is “arresting criminals” and “getting them off the street.”

It’s unclear how many people ICE has arrested in Charlotte or North Carolina. According to available public data, more than 28,000 people have been arrested by ICE so far this year in both the Carolinas and Georgia.

Churches and parent-teacher associations have been among those critical of ICE’s presence and tactics.

“The truth of the matter is we don’t know who that (arrestee) is,” Somers said. “But that person could be your next Laken Riley murderer, or whomever.”

Laken Riley was a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia. Jose Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant, killed her. Prosecutors in the case said she “refused to be his rape victim.” The killing led Congress to pass a law requiring authorities to detain and deport undocumented immigrants accused — but not convicted — of certain crimes.

Somers said she has not heard much from local groups.

This means that millions of federally contracted workers, some of whom make poverty wages, no longer get minimum wage protections because of Trump.
Writing for The Nation this week, Robert L. Borosage and Sara Steffens summarized Trump’s wholesale assault on workers compellingly: Employers are being empowered to act lawlessly toward their workers.
Don’t buy Trump’s false “happy Labor Day” hype—it’s all lies with those fatty, greasy fries.","The man in the McDonald’s suit insists unceasingly that he’s for working people, and huge portions believe him—but what do the facts of President Trump’s actual policies show? What does it mean to be for workers?

You’d think being “pro-worker” would mean things like lowering consumer prices and boosting wages. But the facts show the man in the McDonald’s suit isn’t doing either of those things—in fact, despite the president’s false protestations, he is doing the opposite.

Despite Trump’s profoundly Orwellian lies, prices are, in fact, UP from last year for most categories of daily life, according to the Trump administration’s own Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices for food are up nearly 3 percent since this time last year. Workers’ grocery bills are spiking higher as supermarkets pass along Trump’s tariffs to consumers, as all critics predicted.

You’d think that being for workers would mean supporting higher wages, particularly for working-class and lower-income workers. But again, the man donning the McDonald’s outfit is in fact doing the opposite. As Economic Policy Institute reported, Trump “rescinded an executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors,” effectively slashing these workers’ wages by 25% to 60%. This means that millions of federally contracted workers, some of whom make poverty wages, no longer get minimum wage protections because of Trump.

All of this pain and harm Trump is causing for workers is part of the plan, right out of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—promoting the profit and wealth interests of the rich and corporations over working people’s needs and survival.

Compounding all this harm, on Labor Day the Trump administration “will advance plans to eliminate federal minimum wage protections for millions of child care and home care providers,” the Center for American Progress reports. Think about that. Millions of low-paid domestic care workers will now lose federal minimum wage protections because of the man masquerading as a McDonald’s worker and man of the people.

With the help of a Trump-appointed judge in Texas, Republicans rescinded a Biden rule aimed at expanding overtime pay for millions of working Americans. That rule would have given overtime pay protections to 4 million workers. Seriously, does that sound pro-worker to you?

You might expect a “pro-worker” president to support middle-class jobs—wrong again. Is it “pro-worker” to fire and lay off hundreds of thousands of government workers, all to pay for tax cuts that almost entirely benefit the rich? This is precisely what Trump is doing. New government projections show Trump will have eliminated about 300,000 federal workers by the end of this year. Think about that, 300,000 people made unemployed by Trump. That is an entire city of middle-class workers, fired and laid off, now desperately scrambling to pay bills, buy groceries, and survive. Many will lose their homes if they don’t quickly find another middle-class job. Doesn’t sound very “pro-worker,” now does it?

Would a “pro-worker” president eviscerate worker safety and health protections on the job? That’s exactly what Trump is doing. His horrendous, harmful bill gutted the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, slashing staff and workplace inspections, the lifeblood of maintaining worker safety and health. More than 140,000 U.S. workers died from hazardous job conditions in 2023, according to the AFL-CIO’s annual “Death on the Job” report. That’s 383 Americans dying every day from dangerous working conditions that can be prevented by stronger regulations and enforcement—but the guy in the McDonald’s outfit is doing the opposite, erasing a stunning 30 percent of inspections while radically reducing penalties for endangering workers.

Deepening this harm, Trump eliminated nearly all workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a small but important agency that produces critical research on work hazards, including maintaining a firefighter cancer registry and a lab that certifies respirators for many industries. The cuts are “a very pointed attack on workers in this country,” Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the NIOSH workers union told the Associated Press.

This same alleged “champion” of working people is deploying heavily militarized battalions of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to round up suspected undocumented immigrants—engaging in racial profiling, violating Constitutional due process, tearing apart families, deporting legal residents and some U.S. citizens, raiding farms and warehouses and day labor sites, putting millions of hard-working immigrant (and non-immigrant) families in danger and terror.

This self-anointed man of the working people has waged an all-out attack on the unions that make workers’ lives better, thrashing away at workers’ rights and unions’ ability to organize. On the Thursday before Labor Day, Trump spat out yet another anti-worker executive order aimed at erasing collective-bargaining rights from workers at the National Weather Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other federal agencies, Huffington Post reported.

All of this pain and harm Trump is causing for workers is part of the plan, right out of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—promoting the profit and wealth interests of the rich and corporations over working people’s needs and survival. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Trump’s tax plan enriches the rich while taking from the poor, while adding trillions to the national debt. Those tax cuts primarily going to the rich are paid for in part by Trump’s gutting and slashing of workers’ rights and protections on the job.

Writing for The Nation this week, Robert L. Borosage and Sara Steffens summarized Trump’s wholesale assault on workers compellingly:

Employers are being empowered to act lawlessly toward their workers. Unions are being stripped of the legal structure that protected their existence. Immigrant workers are abused, hunted, and deported. Women and minorities will suffer from discrimination at rates not seen since the civil rights revolution. Workers’ families are shouldering higher costs for food, healthcare, and energy.

On Labor Day and beyond, when the guy the goody grin in the McDonald’s suit says he’s helping working people and making their lives “great again,” remember—all the facts show the opposite. The facts show the Trump administration is undermining workers, making their lives harder, exposing them to more life-threatening hazards, robbing millions of overtime pay, eliminating minimum wage protections for millions more, and attacking the unions that improve workers’ pay and rights and safety on the job.

And for some workers, the turbulent first eight months of the Trump administration have meant doing more with less.
Some industries are especially vulnerable to the disruption caused by Trump’s policies.
The full impact of Trump’s policies may take time to emerge.
“We are seeing a lot of [Trump’s] policies come home to roost in the labor market in a bad way,” said Calemine with the AFL-CIO.","In California, crops have gone unharvested, as farmworkers stay home out of fear of immigration raids. Internal Revenue Service workers in Kansas City have found themselves jockeying over desks after remote workers were abruptly ordered back to the office. Tariffs are putting the brakes on hiring.

President Donald Trump won a second term with a promise to support the working-class voters who backed him. But many workers now feel less secure and find their jobs harder to do — squeezed by immigration crackdowns, federal layoffs and funding cuts, and weakened labor protections.

The uncertainty fueled by these policies, combined with Trump’s trade wars, is beginning to surface in economic data, economists say. The July jobs report, which showed the country had undergone the weakest three months of job growth since the pandemic, was so alarming to Trump that he took the unprecedented step of firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiled and released the data.

Harry Holzer, a Georgetown economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said the difference between today’s uncertainty and past episodes — such as the COVID pandemic and the 2008 housing crash — is that this one is self-inflicted. “All of this uncertainty has been created by Donald Trump and his fairly erratic economic policies,” said Holzer.

Trump’s slash-and-burn tactics have fallen hardest on federal workers facing firings, hiring freezes and deferred-resignation programs and on immigrants threatened by the administration’s intensified arrest and deportation efforts. But economists, workers and labor advocates say the effects have rippled beyond those groups. From restaurants to factories to health care clinics, business owners and workers are operating in an environment of increasing uncertainty and fear.

The Trump administration, for its part, describes his approach to the economy as one that is “prioritizing American workers, who have been undermined by illegal labor and bad trade deals that shipped jobs overseas,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in an email, adding, “The President’s immigration enforcement efforts and trade deals have encouraged businesses to hire American workers at higher wages.”

Yet the number of jobs added in the manufacturing sector has fallen for three straight months. And for some workers, the turbulent first eight months of the Trump administration have meant doing more with less. Wildland firefighters are now staffing ranger stations to compensate for cuts in the U.S. Forest Service, even as fire season enters its peak. At a Kraft Heinz plant in Michigan that makes pickles, mustard and barbecue sauce, employees are working long hours after the Trump administration revoked the work visas of a half-dozen of their immigrant co-workers. And some workers are doing nothing at all. More than 150,000 federal employees, including large numbers at the Treasury, Agriculture and Defense departments, are currently being paid to stay home, a practice that will end in late September when their paychecks stop under a Trump administration plan to thin the government workforce.

Some industries are especially vulnerable to the disruption caused by Trump’s policies. Construction sites, which depend heavily on immigrant labor, are operating with fewer hands, said George Carrillo, who leads the Hispanic Construction Council, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and advocacy group. The shortage has nudged wages higher for those who remain, but it has also slowed projects and increased safety risks, he said. In construction, “You can’t afford to get hurt, and you have to work through the pain.”

The administration’s move to rescind the legal status of more than a million immigrants from countries that have experienced political turmoil or natural disasters is expected to cause further disruptions in construction, hospitality, food, transportation, health care and other industries reliant on immigrant labor.

After the release of the dismal July jobs report, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer tried to shift public attention toward the supposed job gains made by U.S.-born workers. “Wages continue to rise and native-born workers have accounted for all job gains since Inauguration Day,” she said in a statement. But her assertion about U.S.-born workers was a misreading of the jobs report, according to economists interviewed by The Washington Post.

It is not clear that U.S.-born workers have reason to celebrate.

“The research shows very clearly that when you deport immigrant workers, native-born workers lose jobs as well,” said David Cooper, director of state policy and research at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, a think tank affiliated with the labor movement. And the Economic Policy Institute report predicts that Trump’s mass deportation effort — if implemented — could eventually cost U.S.-born workers 2.6 million jobs, with the biggest disruptions expected in Florida, Texas and California, states heavily reliant on immigrant labor. That’s because the hiring of immigrant workers helps support job creation for native-born workers, Cooper said.

In the face of this uncertainty, workers also have fewer protections, as the administration moves to weaken the very agencies tasked with safeguarding them. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces laws against workplace discrimination, has lost its quorum due to firings and has been repurposed to focus on the administration’s anti-DEI agenda.The Trump administration slashed more than 90% of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s budget, eliminating its team that tracked and sought to prevent heat-related deaths among farm and construction workers.

Another example: Trump’s removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private-sector union organizing. The firing deprived the board of a quorum and marked the first time in the board’s history that a sitting member had been dismissed.

That move empowers employers seeking to quash unionization drives, said AFL-CIO advocacy director Jody Calemine. “If an employer wants to delay justice, all they have to do right now is appeal any of the decisions up to the full board, which cannot issue a decision. So even the most fruitless appeals can frustrate workers’ attempts to form a union,” said Calemine.

Through executive order, Trump has also moved to strip nearly a million federal workers of collective bargaining rights, and, earlier this month, a federal appeals court allowed the administration to proceed with the order as the litigation over it unfolds. In early August more than 400,000 Department of Veterans Affairs employees lost bargaining rights as part of what Calemine described as “the single biggest act of union busting in American history.”

* * *

Still, the Trump administration has painted a rosy picture of how workers are doing now — and how they will fare in the future. “Thanks to President Trump’s bold America First agenda, fair trade deals and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are poised to further strengthen the American workforce,” Chavez-DeRemer said in her statement.

Economists and labor advocates worry about the cost of Trump’s tariff policies to workers’ pocketbooks. Even supporters of targeted tariffs — on industries like auto and steel manufacturing — question how much Trump’s chaotic approach to making trade deals will ultimately help workers, given the climate of uncertainty it fosters.

And that’s not the only problem, according to the AFL-CIO’s Calemine. Effective trade policy requires domestic investment in key industries and strong global labor standards, he said, but Trump has done the opposite: signing his “Big Beautiful Bill” that cuts tax incentives for domestic clean energy projects and defunding the agency fighting exploitative labor practices abroad.

That legislation also heavily favors the wealthy, with 65% of benefits going to the top 10% of earners, according to the Penn-Wharton budget model, a nonpartisan research initiative. The lowest-income households are expected to lose out due to cuts in benefits, including Medicaid and SNAP. “This bill is a transfer of money from the poorest households in America to the richest households in America, full stop,” Cooper with the Economic Policy Institute said.

The legislation will also temporarily eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay as a way to help workers. UC Berkeley Labor Center economist Enrique Lopezlira said the benefits of those narrowly targeted tax breaks will likely be outweighed by the costs of Trump’s other economic policies.

“If the full effect of tariffs comes into place, and if the labor market indicators continue to show weakness and eventually more significant downturn, then I don’t see how those future tax benefits will help workers right now or for the rest of the year,” Lopezlira said.

The full impact of Trump’s policies may take time to emerge. For example, the Medicaid cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed on July 4, while projected to lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of health care jobs, won’t go into effect until after the 2026 midterms.

That lingering uncertainty has labor experts and economists feeling pessimistic about what the future holds for American workers.

“We are seeing a lot of [Trump’s] policies come home to roost in the labor market in a bad way,” said Calemine with the AFL-CIO. Workers, he added, are “less free” than they were eight months ago and “increasingly concerned about where our country is headed when it comes to our rights and our freedoms.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2231864749-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 14:56:31.015643

Asylum requests

One of the most common ways illegal immigrants slow or avoid their deportations is by making asylum requests. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review reported 3,797,662 immigration cases pending adjudication, of which 2,372,282 had filed applications for asylum.

Under federal law, noncitizens in the U.S. may apply for asylum to seek protection if they have suffered or fear persecution due to their religion, race, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The application must be filed within a year of that person’s arrival in the U.S., and while federal statute outlines that the application be ruled upon within 180 days, the significant backlog means the process tends to go much longer.

Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and resident fellow in law and policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Examiner that asylum claims are the “biggest driver of the immigration court backlog.”

“There are about 690 immigration judges, they’re hearing 3.7 million plus cases,” Arthur said. “The reason that they can’t get those cases done in a timely manner is if you don’t have any other form of relief from removal, if you’re removable and you’re not eligible for a green card or anything like that, you’re going to apply for asylum.

“It’s going to stretch out the time you’re here, and after 180 days, you can get a work authorization. So that’s the reason why people file them, and even if you’re not eligible for asylum.”

Arthur said that while the process is supposed to take at most 180 days, the backlog generally takes between 800 days and five years.

Other protections that illegal immigrants frequently apply for as they aim to prolong their stay in the U.S. include statutory withholding of removal, which prevents the applicant from being removed only to a specific country based on a threat or fear of persecution of that country, and protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the U.S. from sending someone to a country where they are more likely than not to be tortured. Both protections, however, still allow for deportation to a compliant third country.

Abrego Garcia was denied asylum in 2019, but he did receive a statutory withholding of removal from his native El Salvador, meaning the federal government is prohibited from deporting him to his home country presently. His lawyer told a federal judge earlier this week that they plan to ask an immigration judge to reopen his immigration case and apply for asylum again.

Habeas corpus petitions

Lawyers for illegal immigrants have also filed a flurry of habeas corpus petitions to keep their clients from being removed from the U.S. These petitions challenge a detention by law enforcement, requiring the government to justify a person’s confinement.

Arthur, who was an immigration judge from 2006 until 2015, said these petitions from detained illegal immigrants were rare when he was on the bench but have become more common in recent years. He also noted that Congress has intentionally removed immigration jurisdiction from district courts twice, moving it instead toward federal appeals courts. He said these new habeas petitions complicate that intention.

“District court judges aren’t supposed to have any jurisdiction at all over deportation matters,” Arthur said. “Those are all supposed to go to the circuit courts, and Congress did that deliberately, because they wanted to get district court judges out of immigration determinations entirely.

“[Congress] did this twice. They did it once in 1996, and then they had a problem with, you know, judges taking these things up on habeas. And then they did it again in 2005, in the REAL ID Act of 2005, to say you also don’t get habeas jurisdiction.”

The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a standing order in May granting an automatic two-day pause on the deportation of an illegal immigrant who files a habeas corpus petition in that judicial district. The Justice Department sued the entire bench of judges, arguing, in part, that jurisdiction for nearly all of the petitions should, under federal law, go to the federal appeals court above the district court.

A U.S. district judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the judge did offer other venues for the Justice Department to challenge the standing order.

Efforts to restrict federal immigration enforcement

Illegal immigrant advocates have also succeeded in placing limits on cooperation between local police departments and federal officials, as well as in persuading a court to restrict how federal officials may conduct immigration operations.

A federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued a ruling last month that significantly restricted how federal immigration officials may go about conducting immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The sweeping injunction was upheld by a federal appeals court, and the DOJ asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to issue an order pausing the restrictions.

The lawsuit is another example of district courts inserting themselves into immigration matters and slowing deportations.

“Courts are imposing themselves in areas in which Congress never intended them to go in these cases,” Arthur told the Washington Examiner. “If there is an issue with an alien’s arrest, if there is an issue with due process in the case, the proper venue is with the circuit court, not with the district court judge.

“DOJ has been battling an expansive class action definition that district court judges are using to interpose themselves into these immigration matters.”

SUPREME COURT FRUSTRATED BY LOWER COURT OVERREACHES

While the administration has been slowed in courts from deporting many migrants quickly, it has continued its aggressive efforts to remove illegal immigrants from the U.S.

The Trump administration has also racked up multiple wins on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, with the justices allowing for the removal of temporary legal status and protections for various groups of noncitizens, as dozens of lawsuits over immigration policies continue across the country.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25185732268065.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 10:57:02.865981

George Wallace, he federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect civil rights protestors on the Selma march to the capital.","Hopefully, when the cops come to Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu will put up a better fight than that Rhode Island assistant attorney general did.

Not that Wu will use the “Don’t you know who I am?” defense to ICE agents that Rhode Island Assistant Attorney General Devon Flanagan Hogan used when the Newport cops put her in the back seat of a patrol car the other day.

“Buddy, you’re going to regret this. I’m an AG,” Hogan told the cops. Yeah, right, the cops replied. Hogan has been suspended from her job.

That will not happen to Wu because, unlike the lady prosecutor with three names, everyone knows who Wu is. And, unlike Hogan, she has her own police force.

And everyone knows that she is the mayor of Boston who is standing up to President Donald Trump and his “tyrannical” plan to send National Guard troops and ICE agents into cities like Boston to combat growing crime and to arrest criminal illegal immigrants.

Over my dead body, Wu, in effect, said to Trump and to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Revolutionary Boston stood up to the British and Boston will stand up to you, Wu, in so many words, said.

To cheering Boston patriots (city workers and campaign supporters) Wu in a letter to Bondi and a City Hall Plaza rally, put it this way: “On behalf of the people of Boston, and in solidarity with the cities and communities targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion, we affirm our support for each other and our democracy.

“Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom and a home for everyone.”

“Boston,” she said, “will never back down from who we are and what we stand for.”

In Boston’s case, it is Wu’s insistence that Boston is so free of crime that it does not need help from the National Guard. Also, it has the Boston Trust Act that prohibits Boston police from helping ICE in the arrest of illegal immigrants without a criminal warrant.

While it all sounds bold and brave, Wu’s remarks are not original. Governors, let alone mayors, have been “standing up” to the federal government and the deployment of the National Guard for years. And losing,

While the federal Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of the National Guard for domestic enforcement purposes, there are exceptions. They include insurrection, rebellion, a breakdown in law and order and “unlawful obstruction” of federal actions.

It has been used to maintain law and order more than thirty times in the last 50 years or so, whether invited by a governor or not. Trump needed no invitation in Washington, D.C., a federal city, or earlier in Los Angeles.

While Democrats and progressives vehemently oppose Trump sending the National Guard into states and cities to help deter crime and enforce the law, it was not always the case.

Liberals cheered Democrat President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 when, over the objections of segregationist Democrat Alabama Gov. George Wallace, he federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect civil rights protestors on the Selma march to the capital.

Johnson followed in the footsteps to President John F. Kennedy, who, in 1963, five months before he was assassinated, federalized the Alabama National Guard to remove Wallace from blocking two black students from attending the previously all white University of Alabama.

While it was the proper thing to do under the civil rights movement, Wallace, in his last-ditch “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door” speech, vilified the federal government.

Sounding a lot like Michelle Wu today, Wallace said, “I stand here today, as governor of this sovereign state, and refuse to willingly to submit to illegal usurpation of power by the central government.”

The government’s takeover and use of the National Guard was an “unwelcomed, unwanted and unwarranted intrusion” upon the state.

Which it probably was. But it was legal and the right thing to do.

So is sending in the Guard to do the job that Democrat mayors will not do.

After the long holiday weekend, President Donald Trump will begin contending with significant legal disputes unfolding on multiple fronts. From the Federal Reserve to trade policy to deportations of illegal immigrants, here's a look at the high-stakes legal showdowns shaping Trump’s week.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee, signaled on Friday she will seek to rule quickly on whether Trump acted unlawfully in moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations. She didn’t make a ruling during the two-hour hearing but told both sides to submit more filings by Sept 2. Only then will she decide whether to issue an order that temporarily protects Cook’s job while the case continues.

TRUMP SAYS HE’S ‘ALWAYS’ READY FOR LEGAL FIGHT AS OUSTED FED GOVERNOR PLANS LAWSUIT

Trump's unprecedented attempt to oust Cook sets the stage for a high-stakes legal battle likely bound for the Supreme Court.

Trump fired Cook on Aug. 25, which prompted her to sue him in federal court three days later. Her lawsuit names as defendants Trump, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

It is not clear if Cook has attempted to enter the Federal Reserve's main headquarters in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood in D.C. since Trump's letter terminating her. The Federal Reserve declined to say whether Cook has tried to work from her office, is working remotely, or retains access to the email and other resources she needs for her job.

Before Cook filed her suit, a Fed spokesperson acknowledged the potential legal feud and wrote in an Aug. 26 statement that the Fed will ""abide by any court decision.""

COOK’S POTENTIAL EXIT HANDS TRUMP GREATER SWAY OVER FED BOARD SHAPING US MONETARY POLICY

In a different legal case, Judge Cobb issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from carrying out expedited deportations of illegal immigrants. The policy would have allowed some to be deported without first going before an immigration judge.

In an Aug. 29 opinion, Cobb ruled that the Trump administration’s plan to quickly deport illegal immigrants who had lived in the U.S. less than two years violated their right to due process.

""In defending this skimpy process, the government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment,"" Cobb wrote, adding that the government could accuse ""not only noncitizens, but everyone.""

""The government could accuse you of entering unlawfully, relegate you to a bare-bones proceeding where it would ‘prove’ your unlawful entry, and then immediately remove you,"" Cobb added.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S EXPANDED DEPORTATION PLAN OVER DUE PROCESS CONCERNS

Meanwhile, on the trade front, a federal appeals court said on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose new tariffs on imported goods.

The court said that power lies squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in effect until mid-October.

TRUMP CALLS TARIFF WINDFALL 'SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE' AS CASH SAILS IN

The setback chips away at Trump’s trade policy, long a centerpiece of his economic agenda, which leans heavily on tariffs to raise revenue and exert pressure on foreign trading partners. Trump has previously said that tariff revenue could offset the cost of his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" and add hundreds of billions to the U.S. economy.

According to the Treasury Department’s latest ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" data, released on Aug. 28, total tariff revenues have reached $183.1 billion for the fiscal year.

Understanding the rights of immigrants is crucial for protecting their interests and for ensuring that they do not fall victim to exploitation, discrimination, or abuse.

In this article, we will discuss in detail the rights of immigrants under immigration laws, their legal protections, constitutional safeguards, human rights perspectives, and practical implications.

1. Understanding Immigrant Rights

Immigrant rights refer to the legal entitlements and protections guaranteed to foreign nationals residing in a country, either temporarily or permanently. These rights can stem from national constitutions, immigration statutes, international treaties, and conventions on human rights.

The rights of immigrants vary depending on their immigration status. For example, a permanent resident or lawful immigrant may enjoy broader rights compared to a temporary visitor, while undocumented migrants may have more limited rights but still remain protected under certain legal and human rights frameworks.

The central idea is that while immigration laws regulate entry and residence, basic human rights and legal protections are universal and cannot be denied solely based on nationality.

2. Key Rights of Immigrants Under Immigration Laws

(a) Right to Equality and Non-Discrimination

Immigrants are protected against discrimination based on race, religion, gender, nationality, or immigration status. Most democratic constitutions, including India’s Constitution (Article 14), guarantee equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all persons, not just citizens.

This means immigrants cannot be arbitrarily treated differently in matters of justice, education, or healthcare simply because of their status.

(b) Right to Life and Personal Liberty

One of the most fundamental rights available to immigrants is the right to life and liberty. This includes protection against arbitrary arrest, detention, or deportation without due legal process.

For instance, the Supreme Court of India has recognized that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution applies to all persons, including non-citizens, thereby safeguarding their right to live with dignity.

(c) Right to Due Process of Law

Immigrants, even if undocumented, have the right to fair legal procedures before being detained or deported. This includes:

Right to be heard

Right to legal representation

Right to challenge orders of deportation in courts

Right to appeal adverse immigration decisions

This ensures that immigrants are not arbitrarily expelled from a country without following the proper legal framework.

(d) Right to Work (Subject to Authorization)

Immigrants with legal status such as work permits, employment visas, or permanent residency have the right to work and earn a livelihood.

Employers are generally prohibited from exploiting immigrant workers.

Even undocumented workers, in many countries, are entitled to certain protections under labor laws, such as minimum wages, workplace safety, and protection from forced labor.

(e) Right to Education

Children of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, often enjoy the right to free primary and secondary education.

For example, in India, the Right to Education Act ensures access to schooling for all children up to 14 years of age.

International conventions such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasize non-discrimination in access to education.

(f) Right to Access Healthcare

Many countries provide immigrants, at least legally residing ones, with access to public healthcare systems. Even undocumented immigrants may have rights to emergency medical care because healthcare is seen as an extension of the right to life.

Preventing denial of treatment ensures public health safety and respects humanitarian values.

(g) Right to Family Life and Protection of Family Unity

Immigrants have the right to marry, live with their families, and apply for family reunification in certain jurisdictions.

Immigration laws often provide pathways for spouses, children, and dependent parents to join lawful residents or citizens.

Arbitrary deportation that separates families is often restricted under human rights laws.

(h) Right to Seek Asylum and Refugee Protection

Immigrants fleeing persecution in their home countries are protected under international law, particularly the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.

They have the right to seek asylum and cannot be forcibly returned to countries where their lives or freedom are at risk (principle of non-refoulement).

(i) Right Against Arbitrary Detention

Immigrants cannot be detained indefinitely without legal justification. Immigration detention must follow lawful procedures and must not violate basic human dignity.

They have the right to know the reasons for their detention and the right to challenge it before a judicial authority.

(j) Right to Property and Business (With Restrictions)

In some jurisdictions, immigrants are allowed to acquire property or start businesses, though often with restrictions compared to citizens. For example, in India, non-citizens can buy property subject to compliance with Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations.

(k) Right to Freedom of Religion and Expression

Immigrants enjoy fundamental freedoms such as practicing their religion, expressing opinions, and participating in cultural activities. However, these rights are subject to reasonable restrictions similar to citizens.

(l) Protection from Exploitation and Human Trafficking

Immigrants, especially undocumented ones, are vulnerable to exploitation, forced labor, and trafficking. Immigration laws, combined with labor and criminal laws, ensure their protection from such abuses.

Employers exploiting immigrant labor may face penalties.

Victims of trafficking are entitled to rehabilitation and legal remedies.

(m) Right to Legal Remedies and Access to Courts

Immigrants can approach courts for enforcement of their legal and constitutional rights.

For example, they may file petitions against wrongful deportation or exploitation.

Courts play a key role in balancing state security interests with immigrant rights.

(n) Right to Cultural and Social Integration

Immigrants often have rights to participate in social, cultural, and even some political activities within the host country.

Permanent residents may be allowed to vote in local elections in some jurisdictions.

They are also entitled to protection against cultural marginalization.

3. Special Protections for Vulnerable Immigrant Groups

Immigration laws often recognize the special needs of vulnerable groups:

Children: Protected under international conventions, with special emphasis on education, healthcare, and family unity.

Women: Special protections against gender-based violence, trafficking, and workplace discrimination.

Refugees: Special legal status, non-refoulement protection, and humanitarian aid.

Undocumented Migrants: Even without legal status, they are entitled to basic human rights like emergency healthcare, protection against exploitation, and access to justice.

4. International Perspective on Immigrant Rights

Immigrant rights are not just shaped by domestic laws but also by international instruments:

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) – Recognizes equality, dignity, and non-discrimination.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) – Ensures due process, liberty, and fair trial rights.

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) – Provides for education, health, and work-related rights.

1951 Refugee Convention & 1967 Protocol – Core framework for refugee rights and asylum.

These international standards influence domestic immigration laws worldwide.

5. Challenges Faced by Immigrants in Exercising Their Rights

Despite having rights under immigration laws, immigrants often face barriers in practice:

Lack of awareness: Many immigrants are unaware of their rights.

Language barriers: Difficulty in accessing legal remedies due to linguistic differences.

Fear of deportation: Undocumented migrants avoid reporting exploitation.

Discrimination and xenophobia: Prejudice restricts their ability to integrate.

Complex legal systems: Immigration laws are often highly technical and difficult to navigate without legal assistance.

6. Role of Courts in Protecting Immigrant Rights

Courts play a crucial role in balancing state interests with immigrant rights. Judicial pronouncements have time and again emphasized:

The application of constitutional rights to non-citizens.

Striking down arbitrary detentions and deportations.

Ensuring access to healthcare and education.

In India, for example, the Supreme Court in National Human Rights Commission v. State of Arunachal Pradesh (1996) held that even refugees are entitled to protection of life and liberty under Article 21.

Conclusion

Immigration laws across the globe serve a dual purpose—on one hand, they regulate the entry and residence of foreign nationals, and on the other, they guarantee a minimum standard of rights and protections for immigrants. While citizens may enjoy certain exclusive rights like voting or holding high public office, immigrants are still entitled to fundamental protections such as equality, liberty, education, healthcare, and access to justice.

The rights of immigrants under immigration laws act as a safeguard against exploitation, abuse, and arbitrary state action. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that these rights are effectively implemented in practice. Greater awareness, stronger enforcement mechanisms, and adherence to international human rights standards can ensure that immigrants live with dignity and security in their host countries.

Trump vs. Democrats and everyone else. Lawmakers return to Washington on Tuesday amid a deeply unsettled national political and economic landscape. President Donald Trump is at the center of a dozen controversies roiling the country, as he always seems to be. Congress has been on recess for the last month-plus, with members and senators back home and traveling around the world during August.

The federal government shuts down on Oct. 1, barring a bipartisan funding deal – even a short-term one – as the White House unilaterally slashes billions of dollars of previously approved spending.

Democrats are infuriated. They were skeptical about negotiating a funding deal with Republicans after Trump and GOP leaders jammed through a $9 billion rescissions package in mid-July. Now, Trump is slashing billions of dollars in funding without Congress via legally questionable “pocket rescissions.”

Yet the big question remains whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are prepared to vote to shut down the government over these disputes. Or can they even trust Trump if he tries to cut a deal now only to backtrack later once it’s signed?

Trump is also threatening to take his “crime emergency” and harsh immigration crackdown into more big cities, with Chicago and possibly Boston in his sights. Democrats are outraged here too.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and local officials continue to tread carefully with more than 2,000 National Guard troops in the city, as well as hundreds of federal law-enforcement personnel. Crime has dropped significantly during the federal surge. So Democrats are in a bit of a political bind here, not wanting to look weak on crime even as ICE conducts checkpoints across the city.

Trump’s tariff regime took a massive blow last Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that the president exceeded his authority by imposing unilateral tariffs on dozens of countries. The White House will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, with Trump’s tariffs remaining in place until mid-October.

Tariffs have come to define the president’s economic policies over the last eight months, so this could be a huge blow to his agenda. The Congressional Budget Office said that the tariffs will decrease the deficit by $4 trillion over a decade.

Trump has also been at war with the Federal Reserve, another flashpoint for Democrats. Trump is trying to oust Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor appointed by former President Joe Biden, over allegations of mortgage fraud. A federal judge heard a legal challenge to the firing on Friday but didn’t issue a ruling, meaning Cook remains in place for now.

The Federal Open Market Committee, which determines interest rates, will meet in two weeks. Fed Chair Jay Powell — who Trump has threatened to fire, too – has already signaled an interest rate cut is coming even as inflation worries grow.

The CDC – which is under HHS and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – is in a state of absolute chaos. Trump fired Susan Monarez, the agency’s director, last week. Monarez is suing the administration, and four other top health officials resigned as a result. Schumer and other top Democrats are calling on Trump to fire RFK. That’s not going to happen, but it shows how bad things have gotten at the high-profile agency, already in turmoil following layoffs and a recent deadly shooting at its Atlanta headquarters.

Senate HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.), up for reelection next year, vouched for RFK and other Trump health picks. Yet now Cassidy is vowing to use his panel to investigate the matter. RFK is slated to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

Trump also axed former Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.), who spent less than two months as IRS commissioner. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is serving in the role as of now. But we don’t expect Bessent to serve in the role in the long run, based on our conversations with Trump administration officials.

The Trump administration has a pile of key nominees that need to be confirmed. Stephen Miran has been nominated to take Adriana Kugler’s seat on the Federal Reserve board. Kugler announced last month she would leave the board early.

Speaking of nominations, Senate Republicans are expected to move quickly this month to change the chamber’s rules in order to fast-track the confirmation of Trump’s nominees. This is in response to Democrats’ historic slow-walking of Trump’s picks, which reached a boiling point as the Senate was about to leave for the August recess.

Trump still faces the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, too. While the Justice Department has begun to turn over troves of Epstein-related documents to the House Oversight Committee, Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) are pushing to force a full public release of the files and will hold a Capitol Hill press conference with Epstein victims on Wednesday.

A federal court in Washington has blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to expand fast-track deportations, ruling that the policy likely violates constitutional protections while litigation moves forward.

The case, Make the Road New York v. Noem, was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of the District of Columbia, and the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Make the Road New York. The lawsuit challenged the administration’s January 2025 policy that authorized Immigration and Customs Enforcement to place people into expedited removal proceedings if they could not prove two years of continuous presence in the United States, regardless of where they were encountered.

Previously, expedited removal had been limited to individuals at or near the border or those who had arrived by sea. The expanded designation allowed ICE to arrest individuals at courthouses, workplaces, and community spaces far from the border, stripping them of the chance to present their case before an immigration judge.

In a 48-page memorandum opinion, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb granted a stay of the policy, finding that the government’s expansion of expedited removal likely violated the due process rights of people living in the country’s interior. The judge wrote that while expedited removal had historically applied to individuals with negligible ties to the United States, the new policy swept in people who had lived here for months or years, many of whom had pending asylum claims or other legal avenues for relief.

The court emphasized that the Constitution guarantees no person can be removed from the country without an opportunity to be heard. It found that the truncated process of expedited removal, when applied to people long settled in the United States, created a significant risk of wrongful deportation. The opinion described cases in which people were arrested at their immigration court hearings, their regular proceedings dismissed without notice, and then placed into expedited removal where they could be deported within days, with no chance to contact counsel or gather evidence.

The ruling came after Make the Road presented evidence that ICE had conducted courthouse arrests in cities including New York, Chicago, Seattle, and San Antonio. The group also documented workplace raids that began in June as part of what the administration described as a new phase of immigration enforcement. In one instance, the White House “border czar” Thomas Homan warned, “You’re going to see more work site enforcement than you’ve ever seen in the history of this nation,” according to declarations submitted in court.

The court found that individuals targeted under the 2025 designation faced irreparable harm, including separation from their families and the loss of the chance to pursue asylum claims. It rejected the government’s argument that noncitizens who entered unlawfully had no constitutional protections, calling that a startling claim that would undermine due process for everyone.

The ruling was celebrated by immigrant rights advocates who brought the case.

“The Trump administration’s expansion of fast-track deportations has subjected thousands of people to an unfair, arbitrary, and error-prone system. The court’s decision reaffirms the fundamental principle that people receive due process when the government seeks to deport them or their families,” said Anand Balakrishnan, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel.

“We are glad the judge recognized the immense due-process problems posed by this administration’s reckless expansion of expedited removal. This policy has inflicted enormous harms on MRNY’s members and community, and it has to stop. We will continue to defend our communities from unconstitutional attacks levied by this administration, because we are here to stay,” said Harold Solis, co-legal director of Make the Road New York.

“This ruling is a vital reminder that due process is not optional. Expanding expedited removal would have exposed thousands to wrongful deportation, without even the chance to make their case. We welcome the court’s decision to block this dangerous policy. If the government can sidestep people’s due process rights, it sets a dangerous precedent that puts everyone’s rights at risk,” said Aditi Shah, staff attorney with the ACLU of the District of Columbia.

“This decision rightly rejects the Trump administration’s extremist, unjust policy of fast-tracking mass deportations without due process,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. “This cruel policy tried to deny hundreds of thousands of people — parents, workers, friends, and loved ones — their constitutional right to a fair hearing, putting them at risk of wrongful deportation. Everyone deserves a fair day in court when their future is on the line.”

Declarations submitted in the case included accounts from individuals at risk under the new designation. One woman, identified as Jane Doe 2, described fleeing government-aligned gangs in March 2024 with her partner and children. She was in regular immigration proceedings and had applied for asylum, but under the new rules faced the prospect of being detained and separated from her children. Another member, John Doe 4, said he had filed an asylum application after arriving in October 2023, but feared being placed into expedited removal before his case could be heard.

The court also highlighted cases in which people who had been in the country longer than two years were nonetheless placed into expedited removal because they lacked documentation to prove their presence on short notice. In one instance, a woman who had lived in the United States since 2015 was detained with her teenage son after a traffic stop and ordered removed the next morning without access to counsel.

The government argued that Congress had given the Department of Homeland Security discretion to apply expedited removal broadly and that noncitizens without lawful status were entitled only to the process Congress provided. The court rejected that reasoning, citing more than a century of precedent that even those who entered unlawfully must be afforded due process before removal.

The stay issued by the court halts the 2025 designation and related guidance while the case proceeds. The opinion stressed that it did not question the constitutionality of expedited removal at the border, but only its expansion deep into the interior of the country.

A judge, however, ruled that he specifically could not be deported to El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.
After being returned to the U.S. from El Salvador on June 6, Abrego was immediately placed in federal custody in Tennessee.
Abrego’s conflicts with the Trump administration began on March 12, when he was pulled over by ICE officers while driving with his son on his way home from a worksite in Baltimore.
On March 15, three days after being pulled over, he was flown to El Salvador.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who has become an international symbol of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, then brought back to the U.S. months later only to face charges and new deportation efforts.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the dangerous Salvadoran gang known as MS-13 and should not be allowed to stay here. In August, immigration officials said they intend to send him to Uganda. His family and attorneys deny that he has any gang connections and say he is being punished for fighting for his constitutional rights. They are seeking his release and to stop his deportation.

Abrego, 30, has found himself in the middle of Trump’s crackdown on immigration as his legal battles highlight the new deportation policies the administration has sought to use.

The Salvadoran father of three is currently enmeshed in several court cases.

Most recently, he applied for asylum in immigration court after he was returned to the U.S.

His lawyers have also filed a lawsuit to ensure his right to due process as his deportation case continues. That case is being heard by a federal judge in Maryland, Paula Xinis.

Finally, he has a federal criminal case in Tennessee, where prosecutors have charged him with human trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty.

Here are the latest updates on what could happen to Abrego and how this all unfolded.

A fight to remain in the U.S.

Most recently, on Aug. 25, Abrego’s attorneys asked an immigration judge for protection from deportation amid threats by the Trump administration to send him to the African nation of Uganda, a country to which he has no ties.

Abrego filed the case with Baltimore’s immigration court in the hopes of being granted asylum or a withholding of removal to Uganda, if an immigration judge determines there is a credible threat to his life if he is sent there.

He applied for asylum when he first arrived in the U.S. but that request was denied in 2019 because Abrego had missed the one-year deadline to file. A judge, however, ruled that he specifically could not be deported to El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.

His attorneys argue that he’s now able to reapply for asylum because he exited the country — when he was deported — and re-entered, which started a new one-year clock.

Abrego cannot be deported to El Salvador, but that still leaves the door open to being deported to some other country, a policy pursued by Trump. In August, the administration suggested sending him to Uganda, which has agreed to take in deportees from the U.S. if they have no criminal record and aren’t an unaccompanied minor.

Abrego also has a case before Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland. In that case, his attorneys are seeking to ensure his due process rights are protected as they attempt to stop his deportation.

Last week, Xinis ordered that Abrego remain in the U.S., temporarily blocking his deportation to Uganda, and set an evidentiary hearing for mid-October. Her order also said that Abrego should remain in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement within 200 miles of the court in Greenbelt, Maryland, until she is able to rule on his petition by mid-October. That prevents Abrego from being sent to a state like Louisiana, where the courts tend to have a higher denial rate for immigrants seeking protections.

In the meantime, Abrego remains at a Virginia detention center — about 200 miles from the Maryland courthouse.

The Trump administration’s efforts to deport Abrego to Uganda could have larger implications for its policy of deportations to “third countries.” Rwanda, Costa Rica, El Salvador and others have agreements with the U.S. to accept deportees.

Federal prosecutors said that if he pleaded guilty to human trafficking charges in a federal criminal case brought against him in June in Tennessee, and served a maximum of 10 years in prison, he could instead be deported to Costa Rica, which said it would receive him as a refugee and allow him to live freely.

An attorney for Abrego said he would not accept the plea deal, as he “will not accept charges of which he’s not guilty.”

A turbulent return

Abrego’s detention in the U.S. and the Trump administration’s attempt to deport him to a “third country” follow months of political firestorm.

He was first deported to El Salvador in March because of what officials described as an “administrative error” that was in violation of the 2019 court order.

Abrego was sent along with hundreds of people, most of them from Venezuela, to a notorious Salvadoran megaprison. The fight for his return sparked a legal back-and-forth that involved the Supreme Court, which ruled in April that the federal government had to facilitate Abrego’s return. The decision was a high-profile blow to the administration.

After much resistance from the Trump administration, he was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations.

The charges accuse him of transporting people who were not legally in the United States. Abrego was pulled over in Tennessee in 2022 while driving a van transporting several others, but was not charged with anything at the time. He has said he was helping transport workers and denied the charges.

After being returned to the U.S. from El Salvador on June 6, Abrego was immediately placed in federal custody in Tennessee. He was then released from federal custody on parole on Aug. 22 — leading to a tearful reunion with his family after more than 160 days apart.

He was only free for three days. Abrego was told on the Friday he was released that he needed to appear for an immigration check-in on the following Monday. As his attorneys expected, he was taken into ICE custody and hours later sent to a detention center in Virginia on Aug. 25.

Abrego’s conflicts with the Trump administration began on March 12, when he was pulled over by ICE officers while driving with his son on his way home from a worksite in Baltimore. He was on the phone with his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and told her he had pulled into the parking lot of an Ikea when an officer “put his lights on.”

When an officer got to Abrego’s car, according to Vasquez Sura, they told him to roll down the windows and step out of the vehicle. Abrego told the officer his son was in the back seat and had special needs. In a sworn declaration, she said officers then hung up the call, and minutes later someone called back, identified themself as a person with the Department of Homeland Security, and told her she needed to get there in 10 minutes to pick up her son or they would “call child protective services.”

When she arrived, she said, Abrego was on the curb in handcuffs, and officers on the scene claimed his “immigration status had changed,” Vasquez Sura has said.

He was arrested by immigration authorities and transferred to facilities in Maryland, Louisiana and Texas, the sworn declaration said. On March 15, three days after being pulled over, he was flown to El Salvador.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250828-kilmar-abrego-garcia-timeline-cs-46115e.jpg",N,,2025-09-01 08:56:43.847794

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed on Sunday that the federal government plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in major cities.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem told CBS News.

She pointed to rising crime in urban areas as a factor driving the decision.

“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now, and so we haven’t taken anything off the table,” she said, adding later: “I’d encourage every single big city — San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are — if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom like the people of Washington, D.C., are now ... they should call us.”

Asked about what the expansion might look like in Chicago, and whether it could involve the deployment of National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and arrests, Noem said: “That always is a prerogative of President [Donald] Trump and his decision. I won’t speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities.”

Her comments came a day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order outlining the city’s response to Trump’s planned enforcement operations, including the possible use of National Guard forces.

Johnson criticized the idea of militarized immigration enforcement and warned of potential scenarios involving armed vehicles and active-duty soldiers patrolling city streets — despite no one requesting such actions.

In fact, an injudicious defence of reason may simply inflame passions. For example, the claim by Home Office lawyers that the theoretical rights conferred on recently arrived asylum seekers by international conventions trump the here-and-now interests of anxious householders in small English towns is a made-in-Whitehall disaster for our democracy. Our leaders need to do better. Ministers, for example, have yet to offer a convincing explanation as to why the UK, whose boundaries are shared entirely by nations which are democratic, uphold the rule of law and treat foreigners with respect for the most part, needs to admit anyone crossing these borders. How can anyone be said to have a well-founded fear of persecution in France, Spain, Norway, Portugal, the Netherlands or Sweden?

The haughty dismissal of protests as the work of far-right agitators “whipping up” anti-migrant sentiment was particularly tone deaf after the charging of one man for sexual offences. British people, rightly, do not take kindly to being branded bigots by their own leaders.

Everybody needs to take a breath.

The truth is that the question posed by hostility to asylum hotels is not a technical one, to be solved by speeding up a bureaucratic process, nor a patient, patronising exposition of operational hurdles to stemming the flow. It is a far simpler, emotional query: whose side are you on, really, prime minister?

That perhaps is why the two most compelling voices are not conventional politicians but men who deal not in facts but in what are fashionably called “vibes”. Neither the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, nor the leader of the established church, Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, seems too worried by the sort of concerns that afflict Dickens’s “practical” man. Their debate is a matter of faith and belief, not of management and compromise.

Farage portrays himself as the ultimate patriot, putting the interests of the British people first, ready to break international treaties, redefine human rights and send lawbreakers to languish in the Tora Bora caves of Afghanistan if that’s what it takes. But as Charles de Gaulle said, it can be hard to distinguish between patriotism, when love of your own people comes first, and nationalism, when hate for people other than your own takes precedence.

• Zia Yusuf: Reform’s deportation plans will be like Trump 2.0

Cottrell, as befits the leader of a worldwide communion, puts the commonality of humanity ahead of purely native concerns. As he himself pointed out in our interview on Sky News yesterday, this may seem naive and virtue signalling.

In practice, Farage and Cottrell are not as far apart as they might seem. On some issues they may never agree. It seems evident to me that if there are legal obstacles to decisive action it must be time to rewrite or suspend compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention and the Convention on Torture, as several Tory and Labour grandees are suggesting. The bishops are unlikely to back that step.

However, what the two men would agree on is that the illegal migration crisis demands bold, large-scale policies rather than Whitehall tinkering. Bizarrely, a quiet continuity of policy between Joe Biden and Donald Trump offers some lessons about what can be done, even by those who differ on principles.

First, most potential refugees would prefer to stay close to home. During the past three years, some 4.5 million Latin American migrants who might otherwise have headed north have remained in the region, under agreements set up by Biden and boosted by Trump. Safe Mobility Offices in countries like Colombia, Costa Rica and Ecuador have administered programmes that found them homes and jobs. The White House hardly ever mentions SMOs, given that it would mean sharing the credit with Biden; but their effectiveness is undeniable.

Second, the French are right that the reason so many young men risk crossing the busiest sea lanes in the world is that the same gangs who put them in small boats and in the backs of vans will find them work in the black or grey economies.

Exploitation faced by women in beauty parlours and dangers to men on delivery bikes won’t be prevented by the odd immigration raid here and there. The prospect of digital ID cards has been floated in recent days by the influential Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden. The case for them being required as proof of legitimate employment is almost unassailable. The government should waste no time in legislating.

Finally, if the church and its liberal allies really mean it when they chant “refugees are welcome here”, they should be given the chance to show it. Over the past four years, both the Biden and Trump administrations have encouraged the growth of private sponsorship of asylum seekers. Under Trump, a new initiative, the Welcome Corps, aims to recruit thousands of families who will take in a refugee. Any group of five individuals who can raise about £1,800 can take responsibility for the settlement of potential refugees over their first 90 days with government support. It is claimed that over the past four years some 780,000 people have been helped to settle in the US on such programmes. Sports clubs, schools, even book clubs, and of course churches, have led the way.

Both the Reform leader and the archbishop are Christian believers. The Victorian believers knew how to bring politics and morality, parliament and church, together for the good of the nation. Private sponsorship of potential refugees could not be more British.

After all, the real reason so many people want to come here legitimately is they think we are still the kind, compassionate nation they can glimpse in English novels of the 19th century, the country of the Poor Laws and Factory Acts, of the kind of charity supported by the merchants of Coketown. Many would say that is our past and we have fallen from moral grace. But there’s nothing that says we can’t rise once again.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Feb02538f-3bac-4168-b9f2-169f687a1a1b.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-09-01 05:57:39.574283

Sharereh Moghadam was taken into custody after attending an in-person immigration meeting, which she thought was a step closer to citizenship, according to Aghdassi. Instead, she was transferred to a detention center in Phoenix, Arizona.

""She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,"" said Aghdassi. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.""

Aghdassi says Sharareh was born in Iran and entered the country legally with her documents in order. He believes a recent trip to Iran is the reason behind her detention.

Despite being granted the opportunity to remain in the country, between August 2015 and May 9, 2019, Moghaddam was convicted of two separate theft offenses, demonstrating a clear disregard for U.S. laws and rendering her subject to removal under U.S. immigration law,"" wrote an ICE spokesperson in a statement to NBC4.

The Iranian couple runs a balloon shop along Laurel Canyon, which has gained the community's support over the last few weeks. Customers have begun signing a petition requesting that lawmakers step in before Moghadam's next hearing.

ICE agents don't have the authority to decide who they're going to enforce immigration law on and who they are not.","As ICE ramps up their raids in Connecticut, we see protests in front of courthouses, lawmakers saying they're concerned about the suspects getting their day in court before they're deported.

The pressure, though, is also mounting on local police departments to cooperate with the feds. So how does that impact our local officers?

NBC Connecticut's Mike Hydeck spoke with Rep. Greg Howard (R-Stonington), who is the lead on the House party of Public Safety and Security Committee. He is also a full-time detectives with the Stonington Police Department.

Mike Hydeck: Good to have you back. Thanks for coming. So can you give us, we've seen all the anxiety in the streets and when these officers come up and they try to take undocumented workers off the streets, we've seen that side of the story. What's it like to be in a local police department? Can you give us kind of a behind the scenes look, or some idea of what it's like when the federal government comes in says, ""Look, we need your assistance. We're trying to do an operation here."" Does that prove to be stressful? How does it how does it all unfold?

Greg Howard: I think it's a big picture. First of all, yes, it's stressful on police officers. They have to navigate the nuances of these laws to know what they can say to ICE agents and what they can't. But we don't do that with any other federal agency. FBI is in town, DEA is in town, our local police officers work together. Law enforcement around the country works like that, state to state. Where I live and where I work is on a border into Rhode Island. We work Rhode Island police departments every single day. It's not uncommon. That's the first thing. I think the bigger picture, I think that folks need to understand this, is ICE agents would prefer to take the individuals into custody in a controlled environment, like a police department, like a correction facility, like a courthouse. But for most of these, the ICE agents are forbidden to do that because of Connecticut's Trust Act. That forces the federal agents to go into communities. And what's happening is they are, in their quest to get law violators, in other words, people are committing state crimes and that are here undocumented, in their quest to do that, they're picking up a lot of individuals who are undocumented and have not committed any other crimes, and that's been created. That situation got created because of the Trust Act. And I think that the Democrats in this state have decided through the Trust Act and revamping the Trust Act, they want to poke the Trump administration, ICE in the eye, and it's having real effects on hard working people who are here undocumented because of a failed immigration policy.

Mike Hydeck: So the you're saying that Connecticut's Trust Act is responsible for, maybe it's a it's a mother of two who gets swept up in a raid and doesn't have a human trafficking charge against her.

Greg Howard: That's exactly right. And Tom Holman has been clear about this for over a year. He said specifically, before Trump was even elected and before he became the border czar, he said, If states and cities want to act as sanctuary cities and sanctuary states, whether or not they use that term, and they want to prevent ICE agents from going into these state facilities to get these individuals that are the worst of the the worst under controlled environment, then the ICE agents will be forced to do that in the community. And when ICE agents are in the community, and they find individuals who are undocumented, they're going to take them into custody, too, because they're in violation of federal law. And that's the part that I think gets frustrating when you have U.S. Congressmen or U.S. Senators standing at a podium disparaging ICE agents on the street who don't have control over the law, but are simply enforcing laws that exist, and the individuals that make the laws are doing nothing to fix a broken system, but they're putting it on the backs of the ICE agents on the street who are only doing their job.

Face the Facts

Face the Facts with NBC Connecticut goes beyond the headlines, asking newsmakers the tough questions, giving an in-depth analysis of the big stories.

Mike Hydeck: So when mistakes are made, when a mother is pulled up off the street, or somebody who's just here trying to get a job, can that be rectified in the long run, and does local law enforcement have a role there and say, ""Look, this is somebody that's been in our community for 20 years. We know they've been a baseball coach, and yes, they're here illegally, but they're not human trafficking."" Like, can local people help in those situations?

Greg Howard: I don't think the local police have any role in that. I think that that's a question for our immigration police. And let's be clear, for two decades, both parties in Congress have failed to address a broken immigration system. What frustrates me in this whole thing is we have a U.S. senator standing at a podium blaming on the roe ICE agents for enforcing the laws that he controls. ICE agents don't have the authority to decide who they're going to enforce immigration law on and who they are not. And if that discretion exists, it exists well above their heads. And for a 14-year U.S. senator to go out there and disparage those agents like that really puts their lives at risk. Because, just like we have far right, crazy criminals that threaten Representative Paris or damaged the Capitol and hurt people on January 6, the left have their own far left, dangerous people that would take that rhetoric and use it to assault ICE agents doing their job. He's really putting their lives in danger. And this whole Trust Act is having an adverse effect on, as you say, individuals who are in this country, maybe undocumented, maybe they overstay their visa because our system is broken and they're getting swept up because they are technically in violation of federal law, but we're forcing ICE agents into their communities because the Trust Act will not allow them to come into places like corrections facilities and take people into custody who have violated these laws.

Mike Hydeck: So moving forward, that looks like we should kind of go back and say, ""Look, how do we fix this broken system? What do we do there?""

Greg Howard: That's step one. The United States Congress has again, Senator Blumenthal has been a senator for 14 years, half of that time he's been the majority party in the Senate. But it's not just on his back and the Democrats. Republicans have had equal opportunity as well. We've had Republican presidents. We've had Republican Congressmen. They have not fixed it. That system needs to be fixed. America should be and will always be, a place where individuals who are non-criminals, who don't come here to hurt, people who don't come here to steal, who come here to want a better life, to work hard.

Mike Hydeck: And right now, you could wait a decade for a visa.

Greg Howard: And that is the problem. The system needs to be fixed, but it should never include an opportunity for people who have violated laws to the jump the line. President Obama said this himself many years ago. We need to fix our system, get everybody into the queue, streamline it through. If you're not a convicted felon coming from another country to avoid incarceration in that country, and you're not a dangerous person, by all means, America is a place for everybody, and that's how it should be. It's unfortunate that the Connecticut laws that exist are causing what's happening.",https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/2019/09/ice-police.PNG?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-01 02:57:10.534319

The violence on Sunday took place as thousands of people rallied across major cities in Australia, including Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, to demand an end to what they called “mass immigration”.

The Australian government has condemned the rallies, which took place under the banner of “March for Australia”, as racist, while Minister of Multicultural Affairs Anne Aly said the gatherings were “organised by Nazis”.

About 5,000 protesters, some draped in the Australian flag, and counter-protesters turned up in Melbourne, the SBS Network reported, citing the police.

The network said violent clashes between the two groups erupted “multiple times”, prompting the police to deploy the riot squad who used pepper spray and baton rounds to keep the groups apart.

At least six people were arrested in the city for charges including assault, according to SBS.

The Australian Associated Press news agency also reported on the violence in Melbourne.

The group behind “March for Australia” said on its website and social media that “mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together” and that its rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration”.

Critics denounced the claim, expressing concern over a rise in right-wing extremism in Australia, where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas.

“Let’s not be coy about this. They weren’t protesting immigration from white Western countries,” said Aly, the multicultural affairs minister.

“I would say to those who marched, and who argued that they have those legitimate concerns, that they were organised by Nazis, the very purpose of them was anti-immigration,” Aly told ABC News.

There was no official comment from “March for Australia” about the Nazi allegations.

The speakers at the rally in Melbourne included prominent Australian neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell, The Age newspaper reported. He was among a group of men wearing black who later attacked an Indigenous protest camp in Melbourne, called Camp Sovereignty, the ABC reported.

Organisers of Camp Sovereignty said in a statement that four people were injured, including a woman who was taken to hospital. The organisers also said that police did not arrive until after the men had left and made no arrests.

In Sydney, police estimated that between 5,000 to 8,000 people joined the anti-immigration protest, while the Refugee Action Coalition, a community activist organisation, held a counter-rally.

March for Australia protester Glenn Allchin told the Reuters news agency that he wanted a “slowdown” in immigration.

“It’s about our country bursting at the seams and our government bringing more and more people in,” Allchin said. “Our kids struggling to get homes, our hospitals – we have to wait seven hours – our roads, the lack of roads.”

Counter-protesters in Sydney, meanwhile, held signs pointing out that outside of Indigenous people, the vast majority of Australia’s population are immigrants. “Our event shows the depth of disgust and anger about the far right agenda of March For Australia”, a spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition said in a statement.

Far-right Australian Senator Pauline Hanson joined a few hundred people protesting in the capital, Canberra, while Bob Katter, the leader of a small populist party, attended a “March for Australia” rally in Queensland, a party spokesperson said. In the lead-up to the rally, the veteran lawmaker had threatened a reporter for mentioning Katter’s Lebanese heritage at a news conference when the topic of his attendance at a “March for Australia” event was being discussed.

“Don’t say that, because that irritates me, and I punch blokes in the mouth for saying that,” Katter had shouted at the reporter, according to SBS.

Australia’s Greens deputy leader and spokesperson for antiracism, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, said in a statement that “these rallies must be called out for what they are: acts of racist fear mongering and hate”.

Faruqi also criticised the Labor government, saying it “must end its racist dog-whistling on migrants and refugees and its crack down on pro-Palestine protesters and instead focus on the urgent implementation of the National Anti-Racism Framework”.

Australia’s spy agency has previously warned that far-right groups are on the rise in Australia and that they had become more organised and visible.

When asked specifically about plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago, Noem told CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” “We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations.”

About 35 miles north of the city, the Department of Defense has secured Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago for office space and a command center. Earlier this week, multiple sources told NBC News federal agencies will “surge manpower” to Chicago next week to step up immigration enforcement and arrests.

While Noem said agents will focus on violent criminals, residents near the naval base are fearful ICE will detain immigrants who are working toward becoming citizens, and contribute to their community. A group walked to the base on Sunday to pray for peace and mercy.

""""The Juans, Marias and Joses that are walking with us today are not criminals,"" said Pastor Julie Contreras with United Giving Hope. ""They are individuals who have their homes and have worked here and contribute to this great nation.”

In anticipation of increased enforcement efforts, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order, declaring Chicago police will not collaborate with military on police patrols or civil immigration enforcement.

""We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government. It is unclear at this time what that will look like exactly.""

This blog is designed to provide a plain-language explainer to help community members understand the proposed new laws and what they could mean. It does not constitute legal advice. If you believe these changes may affect you, we strongly encourage you to seek guidance from your legal representative.

What is the Anti-Fairness Bill?

On 26 August 2025, the Government introduced the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (2025 Measures No. 1) Bill 2025 (1) in the lower house of Parliament – the House of Representatives.

The Bill would expand the powers the Government established with their three brutal Bills (2) that were rushed through Parliament in the last sitting week of 2024.

These laws gave the Government new powers to make paid arrangements with other countries to accept people Australia seeks to deport, forcing people to cooperate with their deportation, and to limit people’s rights in immigration detention.

The new Anti-Fairness Bill aims to make those powers stronger by removing people’s right to natural justice (or fair decision making) when the government uses their new powers to make arrangements with other countries to accept people, and to force people to cooperate with their own deportation. It also retrospectively validates some migration decisions that were made before the case of NZYQ.

What would the Anti-Fairness Bill do?

If it passes Parliament, the new Anti-Fairness Bill will mean that:

When making arrangements to deport someone to a third country, the Government doesn’t have to tell the person they are making the arrangement or give them an opportunity to respond – removing their legal protections against government errors.

When giving a person a direction to cooperate with their own deportation, the government doesn’t need to tell them ahead of time or ask them if there are reasons they can’t follow the direction.

Previous visa decisions made under now outdated laws are retrospectively validated, even though those decisions might have been legally challenged after the NZYQ case. Simply put, before NZYQ, most decision makers thought it was likely that the individual would be subject to indefinite detention if their visa was cancelled and made their decision on that basis.. However, as indefinite detention has been deemed unlawful, such people now likely face punitive bridging visas or removal to a third country, such as Nauru, bringing into question whether those decisions were made correctly. The Government can also continue to prosecute criminal charges that were brought as a result of incorrect decisions, validating retrospective criminality.

The Bill is clearly designed to shield the government from accountability, and to legislate its way out of cases that are already in the courts. It prevents people from taking potential legal actions that may have stopped them from being deported.

Why does this matter?

One of the basic legal protections that everyone in Australia has is the right to natural justice. Natural justice is the right to fairness in government decisions, including the right to be told about and given the opportunity to respond to those decisions. The powers involve the making of life-altering decisions that might result in removal to another country forever, serious harm, loss of medical treatment or permanent family separation.

The principle of natural justice is a cornerstone of Australia’s legal system. Removing the right to natural justice sets a dangerous precedent for the way the law treats not just people seeking asylum and refugees, but everyone in this country.

There are constant successful challenges to many migration decisions where natural justice has not been afforded to the visa applicant or holder in Australia’s current system and serves as a source of protection for many, which is another reason this is so concerning.

Who will this affect?

The Government is saying that this will only affect a very small number of people with criminal histories who they are planning to deport to a third country, like Nauru (known as the ‘NZYQ cohort’). However, that is not true. The Bill strips the right to natural justice in the use of the powers that were established by the brutal Bills that were passed late last year. We know that the power of these laws can be used against a broad range of people, including anyone on a bridging visa E that was granted on departure grounds. The government also has the freedom to designate any type of visa it wants to apply these powers to. We know from a Senate inquiry hearing into those Bills that they could affect over 80,000 people (3), and because this new Anti-Fairness Bill relates to those powers, it is reasonable to expect it could affect the same number of people.

What happens next?

The Bill has been tabled in the House of Representatives, which is the lower house of Parliament. The government has the numbers to pass it there, after which it will go to the Senate – the upper house of Parliament – for debate. To have enough votes for the Bill to pass the Senate, the government would need the support of the Coalition. It is not clear when the Government will seek to pass the Bill, but it is likely to be next week.

The bill doesn’t just remove procedural fairness.","This opinion piece by Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay appeared in The Canberra Times on 1 September 2025

Australia has every right – indeed, a responsibility – to manage its borders and make decisions about who can stay in the country.

That includes removing non-citizens who have gone through all the proper legal processes and no longer have a right to remain.

But how we do this matters, because even when someone has reached the end of the road legally, they’re still a person. And every person deserves to be treated fairly.

The Government’s newly announced $400 million agreement with Nauru – which will facilitate the deportation of potentially hundreds of detainees from the NZYQ cohort – brings these concerns into sharp focus. While the Government claims this agreement contains undertakings to ensure proper treatment, no specific details have been provided and proposed amendments to the Migration Act introduced into Parliament earlier this week are specifically designed to remove existing safeguards.

The Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (2025 Measures No. 1) Bill specifically excludes procedural fairness from applying when the Government is exercising specific powers to remove non-citizens (including refugees) to a third country.

Supporters of the amendments argue that these individuals have already had their day in court – that they’ve been through visa processes, appeals, and judicial review.

And this may be true in most cases. But procedural fairness isn’t just about ticking legal boxes. It’s about making sure that decisions are made carefully, transparently, and with respect for the individual. It’s a safeguard against error, and a check on power.

Without it, we risk getting things wrong. And when deportation is involved, getting it wrong can have devastating consequences.

Stripping away these safeguards means turning a blind eye to the real human cost, where lives, health, and families hang in the balance.

One of the biggest concerns here is chain refoulement: where someone is sent to a third country that then sends them on to a place where they could face serious harm.

Australia has international obligations that require the Government to prevent this. If passed, these amendments will make it harder to meet those obligations.

The Australian Government must be able to remove non-citizens who have gone through all the proper legal channels and no longer have a right to stay. That’s not in dispute.

However, these amendments are expressly designed to strip away one of the most basic protections we have in a fair society: the right to be heard.

Under these amendments, the government could deport someone to a third country – one that has agreed to accept them – without giving that person a meaningful opportunity to respond to that decision.

Stripping away procedural fairness with respect to this specific decision means there’s no chance to correct factual errors or share new information that could be critical to ensuring the decision is fair and safe.

Fairness isn’t something that can be selectively applied – it’s a principle that should guide every stage of decision-making, especially when the consequences involve a person’s safety and future.

The bill doesn’t just remove procedural fairness. It also includes measures that operate to retrospectively validate relevant visa decisions and any consequence flowing from them, which may give rise to retrospective criminal liability. This raises rule of law concerns, and needs to be given rigorous scrutiny.

Further, while these amendments are said to be ‘primarily directed to noncitizens who have exhausted all legitimate avenues to remain in Australia’, they appear to have a broader reach.

The Human Rights Law Centre has already confirmed that ‘two of the three people initially targeted by the Government for deportation to Nauru had not yet completed all appeal options relating to their visas’.

These proposed amendments also need to be seen in their broader context as they continue a worrying trend.

Over the past 18 months, we’ve seen a series of rushed, reactive laws in response to court decisions, like the High Court’s ruling in the NZYQ case, which found indefinite immigration detention unlawful.

Instead of using that moment to rethink and improve our migration system, we’ve seen a patchwork of attempted quick fixes: ankle bracelets, curfews, re-detention powers and now this.

Put together, these measures paint a picture of a system being built on the run.

Immigration and asylum policies need to be carefully thought through as there are lots of important factors to balance

These include: maintaining the integrity of Australia’s migration system; the need to protect people fleeing danger and ensure their human rights are respected; and protecting the human rights of the broader Australian community.

These are complex issues that require careful consideration – not quick fixes or rushed decisions.

We can do better. We can protect the integrity of our migration system without abandoning the values that underpin it. That means making sure decisions are fair, that people are treated with dignity, and that we don’t sacrifice human rights for the sake of convenience.

Australia has the tools to manage migration responsibly. What we need is the will to use them wisely, and to remember that even in the toughest cases, fairness should never be optional.",https://humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/opinionpiece/migration%20oped%20image.png,N,,2025-08-31 22:56:17.362159

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago… but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during an appearance CBS News’ ”Face the Nation.”

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago’s crime problems quickly “or we’re coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker have pushed back against the expected federal mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

Johnson has already signed an order barring the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and the state at odds with Trump’s administration as it tries to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Pritzker in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation” charged that Trump’s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of immigration protests in the California city.

“I do know that LA wouldn’t be standing today if President Trump hadn’t taken action,” Noem said. “That city would have burned if left to devices of the mayor and governor of that state.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-01T041751Z_1084224806_RC2XXFAUL2WB_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:56:32.296300

(WGN) — With signs in hand and chants echoing through the streets, immigrant rights groups and supporters rallied Sunday to shut down the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, which they claim functions in the shadows of injustice.

The facility has traditionally been used to process detainees before transfer, with most held for no more than a day.

However, protestors say this practice has changed under President Donald Trump, with people now being held for extended periods in inhumane conditions.

They are urging the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and the Illinois Attorney General to investigate these allegations.

“People are going without beds, with cold food, no showers for three days on average and that’s completely unacceptable,” Omar Flores, the Immigrants’ Rights Working Committee chair, said.

The protest comes amid escalating fears following Trump’s recent threats to deploy federal forces to Chicago for immigration enforcement.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the Trump administration will soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, confirming plans for a stepped-up presence of federal agents in the city.

Last week, the DHS requested limited logistical support from officials at Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency’s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

Immigrant communities and advocates see the move as an intensification of tactics they call aggressive and unjust.

“They might be coming for people who have misdemeanors from 15 years ago now, but they will come after you next,” Louise Carhart, an immigration attorney, said.

Over in the Northshore, families traded protest signs for rosaries and crosses as they marched from Waukegan to the navy base, taking a peaceful stand against the militarization of immigration enforcement.

They say they are demanding an end to policies driven by fear, not compassion.

“It’s just a waste of taxpayer dollars, time, just everything. It’s just unlawful. You should not be taking the National Guard or our military against its own people,” Gigi Javack said.

On Saturday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order aimed at preventing the Chicago Police Department from being federalized for immigration enforcement purposes.

Advocates say that while the future may feel uncertain and frightening, they remain confident in Illinois as they believe the state has some of the strongest immigrant protection laws in the country.

Any military presence ultimately would be President Donald Trump’s call, Noem said, but Gov. JB Pritzker reiterated that such a move would be against federal law and warned it would be met in court “pretty quickly” by the state.

“I’m saying we don’t want troops on the streets of American cities,” Pritzker said. “That’s un-American and, frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn’t seem to. He doesn’t seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.”

Noem and Pritzker each appeared on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, though in separate interviews. Their appearance came as Chicago prepared for more intensive ICE enforcement, which could begin as soon as Friday, with agents based at Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois, and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said.

Asked if a surge in ICE operations was planned for other cities, she said she would not discuss specifics but said the efforts were not aimed at Democrat-led urban areas and could include cities in Republican states.

“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now and so we haven’t taken anything off the table. We’ve been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in,” Noem said.

“I’d encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their cities safer … they should call us,” she said, citing declines in violent crime after Trump federalized law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and deployed National Guard troops.

“Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we’ve got operations that, again, I won’t talk about details on. But we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we’re doing with a political lens,” she said.

Noem, a former South Dakota governor, belittled Pritzker for not personally calling Trump and seeking federal intervention to address Chicago crime.

“This seems like it’s more about Gov. Pritzker’s ego now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he had one murder in Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, ‘What’s your ideas? What can we do?’” she said.

“So he can talk about what a great job he’s doing as governor but he’s failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that’s happening in Chicago,” she said.

Pritzker, in an unaired portion of his Friday interview with CBS White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe, said he has not called the Trump administration to tell them not to come to Chicago because “I think I’ve been pretty clear publicly” and that if the president wants to send in the Guard, “he should call.”

“Honestly, we’d be happy to receive a call,” the two-term Democratic governor said. “When we have an emergency and we need the federal government to send troops in, believe me, I will pick up the phone and call. That is not something going on in Chicago today.”

But Pritzker said the ICE surge is “inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn’t need to be caused.”

“We have people that have lived in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They’re law-abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?” Pritzker asked, saying he would tell Noem “to maybe check herself for, what does she really believe.”

Discussing the issue of mid-decade redistricting, which Trump has pushed in Texas and other GOP-led states, Pritzker said “it is possible to have more Democratic districts in the state of Illinois and we could do it.”

Texas Republicans have signed into law redrawn congressional boundaries aimed at flipping five Democratic seats in the U.S. House for the 2026 midterm elections, as part of Trump’s effort to maintain a GOP House majority through the end of the decade. Democratic-led California recently responded to Texas’ move as Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more U.S. House seats, but late last week, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said he is calling lawmakers into a special session to redraw that state’s House districts.

When asked whether Illinois would join in the redistricting fight, Pritzker said, “That’s not something that I want to do. It’s not something any of us want to do,” he said of Democratic-led states. “If he’s going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.”

Illinois’ Democratic-led redistricting map approved after the 2020 federal census was politically gerrymandered to create a 14-3 Democratic majority in the 17-member House delegation. The Illinois map earned a grade of “F” from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.

Pritzker, who is seeking a third term next year, did little to dispel his interest in a potential 2028 run for the Democratic presidential nomination, saying, “I don’t know what the future holds.”

“You know, I look around, we’ve got a bench among the Democratic Party that is really terrific. I could point to governors. I could point to senators. I think there are a lot of good choices,” he said, according to a transcript of an unaired portion of the interview. “We’ve got a terrific group of people who could be president of the United States on the Democratic side and I’m happy to stand with them as we stand against Donald Trump.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CTC-L-Noem-press-conference-1_232338232.jpg?w=1024&h=711,N,,2025-08-31 20:56:47.291346

Taking their Sunday services from Waukegan's United Giving Hope sanctuary on the road on Sunday morning, a small group of parishioners, including young children, embarked on the 6- mile walk to North Chicago's Naval Station Great Lakes, where federal agents are expected to set up shop as soon as next week in anticipation of large-scale immigration enforcement operations.

""These detentions, these operatives, these raids have an impact on human beings,"" said United Giving Hope Pastor Julie Contreras.

While sources tell ABC News that operations could start as soon as Friday, on Face the Nation on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem refused to go into specifics.

""I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

While on the same show, Pritzker spoke about a potential National Guard deployment to accompany federal immigration officials.

""If they do, they'll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal. Posse Comitatus does not allow U.S. troops into U.S. cities to do, you know, to fight crime, to be involved in law enforcement. That's not their job,"" Pritzker said.

Back at Naval Station Great Lakes, Contreras led her group in prayer. The group included those in charge of the base in her petitions. She admitted that it was hard to get many of her regulars to show up on Sunday. Their fear is too great.

""This morning a mother came and she said others tell her, 'Don't come. They will see you. They will target you.' Can we promise her tomorrow? No, we cannot,"" Contreras said.

Meanwhile, over in the west suburbs, an immigrant rights group held a protest outside the ICE staging facility in Broadview on Sunday.

The group wants the facility shut down. They say people are being held there for days at a time, and do not have access to beds or showers.

After a protest at the facility last month, an ICE spokesperson told ABC7, ""Any accusations that detainees are treated inhumanely in any way are categorically false.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17704957_083125-wls-michelle-great-lakes-prayer-vigil-5p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-31 19:56:47.161024

The extraordinary drama played out over predawn hours on a U.S. holiday weekend and vaulted from tarmacs in Texas to a courtroom in Washington. It was the latest showdown over the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration — and the latest high-stakes clash between the administration's enforcement efforts and legal safeguards that Congress created for vulnerable migrants.

For now, hundreds of Guatemalan children who arrived unaccompanied will stay while the legal fight plays out over the coming weeks.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, who said her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. without their parents or guardians.

Minutes after she wrapped up a hastily scheduled hearing Sunday afternoon, five charter buses pulled up to a plane parked at the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in a part of the airport that's restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing that is used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

The U.S. government insists it's reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that's nonsense and argue that in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

While Sunday's court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, similar emergency requests were filed in other parts of the country as well. Attorneys in Arizona and Illinois asked federal judges there to block deportations of unaccompanied minors, underscoring how the fight over the government’s efforts has quickly spread.

Alarm bells raised among immigrant advocates

The episode has raised alarms among immigrant advocates, who say it may represent a violation of federal laws designed to protect children who arrive without their parents.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that an official list had been drafted with the names of Guatemalan children whom the U.S. administration would attempt to send back to their home country. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

She said she'd heard that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials “were still taking the children,” having not gotten any guidance about the court order.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

Trump administration plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children

Lawyers for the Guatemalan children said the U.S. government doesn't have the authority to remove the youngsters and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys' court filing in Washington.

Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture,” argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.

An attorney with another advocacy group, the National Center for Youth Law, said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly from Guatemala — in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities. HSI is ICE's investigative arm.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then, on Friday, advocates across the country began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

The minors can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

Due to their age and often traumatic experiences getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Guatemala says it is willing to receive the unaccompanied minors

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied and are being held in government facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could pass age limits for the children's facilities and be sent to adult detention centers, he said.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said that his government has a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after

In an appearance on CBS News' Face the Nation, Noem said Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be expanding operations in Chicago to ""go after the worst of the worst in the country, like President [Donald] Trump has told us to do.""

She said the agency would be ""focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.""

Noem's comments come after weeks of Trump leveraging federal resources -- namely the National Guard -- to target crime in cities he deems unsafe. He deployed troops to Washington, D.C., in August to crack down on crime, which he described as ""out of control.""

Speaking Aug. 11 about the deployment, Trump called out other cities with high crime, including Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland, Calif., and New York City. He followed that up Saturday with a Truth Social post calling Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker ""weak and pathetic,"" saying he should straighten out crime or ""we're coming.""

In response to Trump's threats to send National Guard troops to Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson on Saturday signed an executive order seeking to avoid militarization in the city. The order demands that Trump end ""his threats to deploy the National Guard"" to Chicago.

""I do not take this executive action lightly,"" Johnson said during a signing ceremony. ""I would've preferred to work more collaboratively to pass legislation ... but unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time. We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some kind of militarized activity by the federal government.""

In an appearance on Face the Nation, Pritzker said no one in the Trump administration has reach out to him or any other officials in Chicago about a possible deployment of National Guard troops to the city, which he described as ""an invasion."" He said federal agencies should coordinate with local law enforcement.

""But they don't want to do that either, and I must say, it's disruptive, it's dangerous,"" Pritzker said. ""It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are, and when we can't coordinate with them.""

Noem’s comments came a day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson struck back against what he called the “out-of-control” plan to surge federal officers into the city. The Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order Johnson signed Saturday.

The Homeland Security Department last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency’s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago ... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during a Sunday appearance CBS News’ ”Face the Nation.”

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, saying they were needed to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago’s crime problems quickly “or we’re coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker, both Democrats, have denounced the expected federal mobilization, noting that crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

In his order signed Saturday, Johnson directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.”

Asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably “taking orders,” Johnson replied: “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”

Johnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal immigration officers have done since Trump launched his crackdown.

The federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Friday and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.

Pritzker, in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation,” said that Trump’s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of protests there against immigration raids.

“I do know that L.A. wouldn’t be standing today if President Trump hadn’t taken action,” Noem said. “That city would have burned if left to devices of the mayor and governor of that state.”

Unlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration, rather than being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, Trump administration officials have said.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Johnson’s order builds on the city’s longtime stance, that neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and they stand against Trump’s mobilization plan.

During his news conference Saturday, Johnson accused the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the Constitution” and seeking a federal presence in Democratic cities as retribution against his political rivals.

“He is reckless and out of control,” Johnson said. “He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country.”

In response, the White House contended that the potential flood of federal agents was about “cracking down on crime.”

“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.

Noem said today that a National Guard presence is a “prerogative of President Trump” and praised his decision to send troops to LA earlier this year.","Earlier today, we covered President Donald Trump’s comments indicating he’ll pursue federal voter ID laws and restrictions on mail-in voting.

The president has a long history of falsely claiming mail-in ballots are fraudulent — despite many Republicans using the method to vote for Trump in the 2024 election.

These are some of his latest comments on the matter:

• Trump falsely claimed on Truth Social that the United States “is now the only country in the world” that uses mail-in voting, which CNN fact-checked. Several countries use mail-in ballots, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Switzerland.

• Later that day in the Oval Office, Trump claimed you could never have a “real democracy” with mail-in ballots, which he called “corrupt,” while acknowledging his claim about being the only country to use them could be wrong.

• Trump has previously called mail-in voting a “disaster” and the “greatest scam in the history of politics.”

But, during the campaign: Trump’s team publicly embraced mail-in ballots, at least to the degree it felt it had to.

Vice President JD Vance gave voice to that on the campaign trail in October of last year, urging Republicans to play the same “game” as Democrats.

“If you can vote early, vote early. If you get your friends to vote, early vote, early vote by mail, do everything that we can,” Vance said. “I don’t love election season. I like Election Day, but as Donald Trump has said, it is what it is, and so we’ve got to use every tool at our disposal to get out there and vote.”

President Donald Trump is paying attention to what his supporters are up to online, sharing several posts this weekend, including apparent AI-generated images depicting him as law enforcement, including an image of him as a SWAT team officer.

The images were originally posted on August 21, the same day Trump said in a radio interview he would be doing a ride-along with law enforcement in Washington, DC, amid his federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department. The president appeared to scrap those plans that afternoon, instead speaking at a US Park Police facility in Southeast DC and handing out pizza and burgers to law enforcement across several agencies.

Trump also reposted an apparent AI TikTok video showing him morphing from a baby to present day, showing various stages of his life in between.

Trump added in a follow-up post, “THIS IS RATHER INCREDIBLE. WHO DID IT??? PRESIDENT DJT.”

In another image Trump shared, the globe is behind him with both his hands raised and a cryptic message in the background: “The world will soon understand nothing can stop what is coming.”

“Q+” is written above his left hand, which some QAnon conspiracy theorists believe is an alias for Trump posts.

While some of the posts are more complex and appear AI-generated, Trump also reposted a good old-fashioned meme of himself smirking with the words: “I DRIVE STUPID PEOPLE COMPLETELY INSANE.”

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan received a call around 2:30 a.m. ET notifying her that a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children in US custody were being processed for deportation.

Sooknanan, who has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the kids at the urging of attorneys and advocates, appeared at an emergency hearing hours later.

At the hearing, Sooknanan reiterated the order she made this morning, saying the US government is not to remove any of the individual plaintiffs or other unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in US custody — who she ruled were also protected under the order — for two weeks.

During the hearing, Sooknanan asked the Department of Justice’s lawyer to clarify the children’s whereabouts. Some of the kids had already been placed on planes after being roused at their shelters in the middle of the night, but they are expected to be returned to US custody, according to the DOJ.

At least one plane in Texas carrying Guatemalan children was turned around, according to Neha Desai, managing director of Children’s Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law.

A federal judge has temporarily blocked the US government from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in federal custody, after attorneys and advocacy groups raised urgent concerns.

The Trump administration was expected to begin sending the kids back to their home country today, according to a notice sent to attorneys, prompting a scramble by lawyers.

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the removal of 10 named plaintiffs — Guatemalan minors ranging in age from 10 to 17 — as well as all Guatemalan unaccompanied minors in federal custody as of early Sunday. The order lasts for 14 days.

What happened overnight: Attorneys say the children were “terrified and confused” after being woken up at their shelters in the middle of the night as the government set its repatriation plans in motion.

The US Office of Refugee Resettlement had notified the shelter providers that certain children had been identified for reunification with parents or legal guardians in Guatemala and had to be ready for discharge within hours, with documentation, medication, belongings and prepared meals.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys argue the Trump administration is violating US law, which provides special protections for unaccompanied minors and ensures they cannot be removed without due process or the opportunity to seek relief from deportation. Advocates say the kids could be at risk if they’re returned to the Central American country.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago.

Pritzker called such a move an “invasion” and framed the potential deployment as part of a broader authoritarian push by President Donald Trump.

Pritzker said the administration “ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they’re coming, where they’re coming — if it’s ICE, or if it’s ATF, or whoever it is.”

Pritzker warned that if the Trump administration were to deploy ICE and the Guard to Chicago, his administration would take swift legal action.

What the White House is saying: In response to a CNN request for comment, spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused Pritzker of trying to “deflect from the terrible crime crisis” in Chicago, saying the city would be safer if Pritzker focused on his job.

CNN’s Kit Maher, Priscilla Alvarez, Alayna Treene, Hannah Rabinowitz and Haley Britzky contributed to this report.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore dismissed the idea of deploying National Guard troops in Maryland, saying that while he would love greater federal support for fighting crime in the state, the Guard is ill-equipped to do so.

President Donald Trump has deployed the National Guard in both Los Angeles and Washington, DC, despite resistance from local Democrats, and he’s telegraphed plans to do the same in cities across the country, including Baltimore. Trump and Moore have sparred verbally over the issue in recent weeks.

When host Martha Raddatz pushed back, saying the Guard is trained in law enforcement, especially for major disasters, Moore said the troops are specifically not trained for municipal policing, in comparison with agencies like the FBI and ATF.

Moore said he wants federal help in Maryland, but would propose other solutions, if the president asked.

The Trump administration plans to send additional immigration enforcement resources to Chicago this week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today.

CNN reported last week that a major enforcement operation will soon be underway in the city, and Chicago’s mayor laid out plans to resist the federal crackdown yesterday.

Noem declined to provide additional details, saying she was protecting law enforcement.

What we know about the plans: Preparations are underway to send armored vehicles and surge federal agents to Chicago, with the operation expected to kick off by Friday, multiple sources told CNN last week. Those sources cautioned that plans were still in flux.

The operation is expected to be similar to those held in Los Angeles earlier this summer, involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and potentially other agencies. And like in Los Angeles, the Trump administration is preparing the National Guard to respond to unrest.

Noem said today that a National Guard presence is a “prerogative of President Trump” and praised his decision to send troops to LA earlier this year.

Future targets: Asked about expanding beyond Chicago, Noem said the Trump administration has “not taken anything off the table,” and specifically named San Francisco, Boston and Chicago.

President Donald Trump says he will sign an executive order requiring Americans to show ID at the polls, and reiterated he will take action to curtail mail-in voting.

“Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!! Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military. USE PAPER BALLOTS ONLY!!!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social late last night.

Some background: States have varying requirements for voters, with 36 states already having laws in place requiring or requesting certain forms of ID, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Trump has long championed a baseless lie that the results of the 2020 election were tainted by widespread fraud.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota warned this morning that the Trump administration’s cuts to mass shooting prevention programs could hinder efforts to deter future violence.

Omar’s comments come days after two children were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in her district.

The Trump administration cut funding in Minnesota for efforts to identify potential mass shooters and head off violence a month before the school shooting in Minneapolis.

Omar accused the Trump administration of wanting to “deflect from the reality” of mass shootings and of neglecting “actual solutions,” like an assault weapons ban and more mental health care.

What the Trump administration is saying: A DHS spokesperson defended the cuts, claiming the grant program was “nothing more than a slush fund for left-wing ideologies, and did next to nothing to combat actual threats in our communities.”

On CNN’s “State of the Union” this morning, White House counterterrorism official Sebastian Gorka also defended the administration’s approach, blaming local authorities in part for establishing so-called gun-free zones, which he said make a soft target for mass shooters. Pressed on the cut funding, Gorka said he doesn’t believe federal funding is the “answer for mental health issues.”

“I would look to the town, to the city, to the county or to the state because they know the threats in their communities better. Don’t wag your finger at DHS,” Gorka said.

Top Republican weighs in: The US needs to address the “root cause” of mass shootings, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said today in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”

But Emmer brushed off questions about why he did not vote for the bipartisan federal gun safety bill that Congress passed in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting, saying it could not help identify the Minneapolis shooter as a danger.

This post has been updated with Gorka’s remarks.

An appeals court ruling that said President Donald Trump unlawfully leaned on emergency powers to impose many of his sweeping tariffs was only a “hiccup,” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Fox News today.

Though Friday’s ruling stuck down many of the historic tariffs, the import taxes will remain in effect until October 14, giving the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Greer said trade negotiations are continuing despite the court ruling. He added that US trading partners “know that tariffs are now part of the landscape” and noted that the ruling did not strike down section-specific tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum.

But if the ruling is upheld, Greer claimed it would be “disastrous,” citing the US trade deficit.

“All these countries know that we have to rebalance … that’s why people are moving forward with their deals, regardless of what this court may say,” he said.

The Trump administration’s removal of Guatemalan children in US government custody is expected to begin today, according to a notice sent to attorneys.

The notice prompted a scramble among lawyers who say kids were woken up in the middle of the night and are at risk if they are returned to their home country.

CNN first reported that the Trump administration was moving to repatriate hundreds of Guatemalan children who arrived to the US unaccompanied, in coordination with the Guatemalan government.

A federal judge temporarily blocked the removals of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in US custody early Sunday, though plans appeared to still be underway, according to an immigration attorney representing Guatemalan children who were transported out of their shelter after the judge’s ruling.

Who’s being targeted? The children, ranging in age, are believed to not have a parent in the US, though they may have a relative, and have a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala. The criteria also includes children who do not have a pending asylum case and won’t be trafficked upon their return, according to the notice.

But attorneys who represent some of the kids say those who have been identified are at risk if returned to Guatemala and are in ongoing immigration proceedings.

CNN reached out to the White House, as well as the departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security for comment.

President Donald Trump has cast some doubt on the likelihood of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he expressed confidence that a trilateral meeting — in other words, a sitdown between all three men — would happen.

How we got here: Following a summit with Putin in Alaska and hosting Zelensky and European leaders at the White House earlier this month, Trump said he began arranging a bilateral between Putin and Zelensky as the next step toward reaching peace.

But Putin has not signaled he is willing to come to the table with Zelensky. Just days ago, Russia launched its second-largest air assault of the war on Ukraine, killing at least 25 people and damaging buildings belonging to the European Council and British Council, as well as several residential high-rises.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2231525759-20250829170443340.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-31 18:57:33.909737

She will return to Honduras — the country she left at age 8 — where she will live with her maternal grandparents and start over from scratch.","Allison Bustillo Chinchilla, a young nurse from Charlotte currently held at an immigration detention center in Georgia, has been granted relief by an immigration judge that allows her to leave the country voluntarily instead of being deported — a decision that will enable her to return to the United States without facing a 10-year reentry ban.

Allison, 20, has been detained for six months at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. She had nearly given up her legal fight due to health issues and unsanitary conditions at the facility. Then, unexpectedly, she was informed on Tuesday, Aug. 26, that she would have a hearing that same day.

She was arrested on the morning of Feb. 20 at her home in Charlotte while caring for her three younger siblings — the youngest of whom has autism — while her mother was at work.

The chaotic arrest was carried out by ICE agents who forcibly entered the apartment heavily armed, looking for someone else.

Judge grants Allison’s request

Keily Chinchilla, her mother, watched the hearing on her phone via the Webex platform. She said it lasted about an hour.

“They moved up her hearing with almost no notice. She was desperate and couldn’t take it anymore. The government attorney said she would be removed from the country, but she asked the judge for voluntary departure — the least they could do for her,” Keily told Enlace Latino NC.

Allison said that “ICE shattered her dreams of continuing her education.” The young woman had graduated as a nursing assistant and had earned a $60,000 scholarship to attend Gardner-Webb University.

She will be able to return without punishment

Her case was handled by attorney Marty Rosenbluth, who had filed an asylum application as a last resort to prevent her deportation.

“Allison wanted to leave the country in a way that would allow her to come back because her mother is in the process of applying for a green card. Once her mother gets it, she’ll be able to apply for Allison’s return,” Rosembluth told Enlace Latino NC.

The attorney explained that Allison was technically not eligible for voluntary departure because she was classified as an undocumented immigrant. However, the relief granted by the judge is effectively the same: she can leave on a commercial flight without a removal order and won’t face the 10-year bar from reentering the country.

Lingering frustration

Still, Keily is not entirely satisfied with her daughter’s decision, as she didn’t want her to have to leave the country.

“I’m frustrated after so much fighting, and that they didn’t allow her to stay, even though she has no criminal record and has been a good person and student. Now she has to go back to Honduras — a country she doesn’t know and where her life could be in danger,” the mother said.

She sought a habeas corpus petition

In her efforts to stop her daughter’s deportation, Keily also paid $3,500 in July to another attorney to file a habeas corpus petition. But according to the mother, the petition was filed just before the hearing.

This legal procedure is used to request a court review of a person’s arrest or detention, which could have allowed Allison to appear before a judge in person to determine whether her arrest was lawful and potentially secure her release.

“My daughter could have been released, because the arrest was illegal — they forced their way into my home looking for someone else,” she said.

Although Allison’s exact departure date is still unknown, she could be leaving soon. She will return to Honduras — the country she left at age 8 — where she will live with her maternal grandparents and start over from scratch.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/public/news/local/qep17p/picture311921826/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Nota-5-Allison-.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:57:20.449296

The Archbishop of York has urged Britain to resist what he called “kneejerk” proposals to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants, warning they would fail to provide a long-term solution to irregular migration.

Speaking to Sky News, Stephen Cottrell, who is currently acting as the spiritual head of the Church of England until a new Archbishop of Canterbury is appointed, criticized the far-right party’s proposal to remove around 600,000 people from the country.

The policy, unveiled by Reform leader Nigel Farage earlier this week, would involve negotiating deportation agreements with regimes such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the authorities in Iran.

Cottrell said that he has “every sympathy” with people who are concerned about asylum seekers coming to the country illegally. But he argued that the measures would not “solve the problem.”

Asked by presenter Trevor Phillips to respond to those calling for an automatic policy of detention and deportation for anyone entering the UK unlawfully, Cottrell replied: “You haven’t solved the problem. You’ve just put it somewhere else and you’ve done nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country. And so if you think that’s the answer, you will discover in due course that all you have done is made the problem worse.”

He continued: “Don’t misunderstand me, I have every sympathy with those who find this difficult, every sympathy – as I do with those living in poverty. But… we should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short term kneejerk ‘send them home’.”

Reform’s hardline immigration proposals have become one of the central issues in the UK’s political debate, but they have drawn strong criticism from church leaders, human rights groups and opposition parties.

The agreement reportedly stated that when construction of Northgate Parkway was complete, the city would accept full control and jurisdiction over Northgate Parkway between the Northgate Exchange and Olympus Drive.

The ruling vacated District Judge Robert C. Naftz’s previous 2023 decision, in which he dismissed the case in favor of the city.

The Idaho Supreme Court decided that the case would be allowed a new review of the Rupp family’s claims that city officials and private business partners conspired to block their access to land and cheaper water prices.

RELATED | Local family files $21 million lawsuit against the city of Pocatello, others

According to the new ruling, the Supreme Court found that Naftz had failed to analyze the city of Pocatello’s motions and did not allow the family an opportunity to argue against multiple motions.

“The Court concluded that the district court failed to analyze Respondents’ motions for summary judgment, did not permit the Trusts the opportunity to argue in opposition to the summary judgment motions,” according to the ruling.

The Supreme Court also stated that Naftz’s failure to effectively analyze the evidence in the case could have been used to punish Nathan Olsen, the family’s attorney, for filing late.

“The district court never held a hearing on the merits of the motion for summary judgment,” states the Supreme Court. “Instead, at the scheduled hearing on the motions, the district court did not allow argument on the motions for summary judgment because it believed further proceedings on the summary judgment motions were contingent on its decision regarding the second motion to continue and the motions to strike.”

The court then reversed the dismissal, vacated the attorney fee award to defendants, and sent the case back to the district court.

“For these reasons, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment, vacate its judgment dismissing the amended complaint, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,” writes the Supreme Court.

The lawsuit allegations

The newly reinstated lawsuit mainly alleges conspiracy by the city, Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad, real estate developers Ken Pape and Arvil Swaney, and their companies, Portneuf Development LLC and Millennial Development Partners LLC.

The Rupp Family Trust (also known as Trusts in court documents) manages a 930-acre parcel of agricultural land east of the Northgate Interchange off Interstate 15, primarily part of Bannock County, that the family has owned for nearly 100 years.

In 2017, the trust entered into a purchase and sales agreement with Millennial Development Partners LLC to sell a 150-foot-wide strip of land to construct the Northgate Parkway, which would connect the Northgate Interchange with Olympus Drive in Pocatello.

According to the lawsuit, the trust says that the agreement required Millennial to construct an intersection on Northgate Parkway to provide vehicle access to the trust’s property, water, sewer stubs, and sewer line.

Millennial also promised the trust that its property would have additional access points along the Northgate Parkway, including access to an intersection at Olympus Drive, according to the lawsuit.

Millennial and Portneuf Development LLC then reportedly entered into a partnership called Town Center to construct Northgate Parkway.

Millennial also entered into a construction cooperative agreement with the city of Pocatello and others to determine the design and construction of the Northgate Exchange and Northgate Parkway.

The agreement reportedly stated that when construction of Northgate Parkway was complete, the city would accept full control and jurisdiction over Northgate Parkway between the Northgate Exchange and Olympus Drive.

According to the trust, Town Center entered into a partnership with the city, called “the Northgate Partnership.”

The lawsuit says this partnership needed the water rights associated with the trust’s property to develop its property, and had “a unified purpose of devaluing the Rupp Trust property” so it could buy it for less than market value, and sell it to other developers for a profit, according to the lawsuit.

In December 2018, the trust signed an agreement with the city of Chubbuck to annex 300 acres of its property into Chubbuck after learning that Chubbuck could offer access to water at a lower price than Pocatello.

The trust says that following this annexation, the Northgate Partnership “executed their plan to achieve their respective aims.” The trust alleges that Millennial never constructed the promised access points and infrastructure, effectively land-locking the property.

The trust says the Northgate Partnership “interfered with their ability to access their property from Northgate Parkway, engaged in efforts to steer prospective purchasers away from the Trust’s property, and interfered with prospective purchase agreements and offers to purchase the property.”

In November 2019, after construction of Northgate Parkway was complete, Town Center reportedly filed an application with the city of Pocatello concerning the road.

The 97-page lawsuit states that Northgate Parkway was constructed as a boulevard-style road with 10-foot-wide strips on both sides. The application aimed to give the city ownership of the roadway, but did not address the 10-foot-wide strips on either side.

When the City Council considered the application in January 2020, Harold Lavelle Rupp Jr., the trust’s trustee, appeared at the meeting and reportedly indicated that he was “neutral.”

The city approved the application and accepted the dedication of Northgate Parkway. Town Center later conveyed the 10-foot strips on both sides of the road to Millennial and Portneuf Development.

The Trusts say that Millennial and Portneuf’s ownership of the strips blocked the Trust’s property from having direct access to Northgate Parkway.

On February 4, 2022, the trust filed an official complaint against Millennial and one of its members, Arvil Swaney, Portneuf Development and Portneuf Builders LLC, one of their members, Ken Pape, and the city, alleging a breach of contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and fraud.

Attorney comments

EastIdahoNews.com made multiple requests in 2022 for comment from Pocatello city attorney Jared Johnson about the suit, but never received a response.

We also reached out to the Rupp family’s attorney, who provided the following statement:

“All the Rupps were asking for in the appeal was to have their day in court, which the Idaho Supreme Court granted. The Court’s decision is therefore a total victory for the Rupp family and justice in general. This is a case that I believe can be resolved at no cost to the City and the other defendants fairly quickly and with great benefit to not only the Rupps, but the greater Pocatello area economically. The undisputed facts in this case ultimately support the Rupps, which is why great lengths have been made to prevent this case from being tried on the merits. This decision by the Supreme Court, however, has ensured that the case will. At the end of the day, the Rupps simply want full access to Northgate Parkway, which just seems reasonable and sensible. The Rupps are evaluating the steps moving forward. Rupps are prepared to aggressively proceed with civilly resolving their claims and protect their property rights.”

Mayor’s response

EastIdahoNews.com reached out to Blad for a comment, and he provided the following statement:

“The Idaho Supreme Court’s ruling returns the Rupp case to District Court for a hearing on the merits. This gives the city of Pocatello the opportunity to present the facts openly and demonstrate that the City acted appropriately. I remain confident in our position,” said the mayor.

The federal government entered into the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement under the Biden administration in December 2023 after two years of negotiations.
Those tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding land but maintaining a perpetual right to their fishing grounds in the Columbia River Basin.
Four species of salmon in the Columbia River Basin have been listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act since 1991.
Litigation had been ongoing for decades before it was halted as part of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement.","Time is running out for wild salmon in the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest. Their populations, as well as those of some other native fish, have been declining for decades. Now, President Donald Trump is attacking the progress that had been made to restore those once-abundant salmon runs.

In June 2025, Trump signed a memorandum signaling his administration’s unwillingness to consider dam removal on the lower Snake River, a tributary of the Columbia River, and reneging on a landmark agreement that would have provided more than a billion dollars over the next decade to Pacific Northwest tribes for renewable energy projects and salmon recovery.

The federal government entered into the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement under the Biden administration in December 2023 after two years of negotiations. Other parties to the agreement include environmental advocates; Oregon; Washington; and the Umatilla, Nez Perce, Warm Springs, and Yakama tribes. Those tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding land but maintaining a perpetual right to their fishing grounds in the Columbia River Basin. The government has failed to ensure the tribal fishing rights it promised to protect in those treaties.

Yakama Nation Tribal Council Chair Gerald Lewis said in a statement that the Trump administration’s withdrawal “echoes the federal government’s historic pattern of broken promises to tribes.” Still, others who were involved in negotiations to secure that agreement have vowed to continue efforts to restore salmon populations and fulfill treaty obligations even as the federal government seeks to undermine them.

“The Trump administration’s decision to pull out of this agreement is short-sighted and regrettable,” Miles Johnson, legal director at Columbia Riverkeeper, told Truthout. “But folks in the Pacific Northwest who care about salmon, and salmon cultures and our rivers, we don’t get to stop working on this just because it becomes more challenging.”

Dozens of hydroelectric dams built beginning almost a century ago on the Columbia River and its largest tributary, the Snake River, eliminated spawning grounds, blocked fish passage between spawning and rearing habitats, and altered river ecology in ways that can impair a salmon’s immune system or undermine their natural migration instincts. More recently, climate change has placed additional stress on salmon populations.

The dams in the Columbia River Basin have been disastrous for fish populations: The number of wild Chinook salmon on the Snake River fell from about 90,000 in the mid-1950s, when there was just one dam on the waterway, to a mere 10,000 in 1980, seven additional dams later. Four species of salmon in the Columbia River Basin have been listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act since 1991.

Congress acknowledged that wild salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin were dwindling and committed to funding hatcheries meant to stop their decline more than 80 years ago. But the facilities have fallen short of that goal. Today, even the hatcheries are threatened, as salmon survival rates have dropped so low that some struggle to collect enough fish for breeding.

“The truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a June 2025 statement in response to the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement.

Experts now agree that dam removal is essential to stop the decline of native fish populations. One proposal, in particular, which argues for the removal of four dams on the lower Snake River in southeastern Washington, has garnered widespread support from scientists and advocates, as well as other tribal leaders. “We’ve learned over the last 30 to 40 years of studying these fish intensely that those four dams on the lower Snake River are four dams too many,” Johnson told Truthout.

The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement stopped short of calling for the removal of those dams, but it committed to meaningful steps in that direction. The agreement promised funding to study and develop solutions to mitigate the effects of dam breaching on transportation, recreation, irrigation and energy production in the region. It also committed funding to tribal-led alternative energy projects, which could have compensated for the eventual winddown of the hydroelectric dams.

“The concepts behind that agreement remain a really responsible, well-thought-out and careful path that sought to ensure a win-win scenario for all the different constituencies that depend on a healthy Columbia River,” Michael Garrity, special assistant at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), told Truthout.

Even though the agreement takes what Garrity and other experts characterize as a measured approach, Trump called it “radical environmentalism” in an effort to slander it and labeled concerns about climate change “misplaced” in his memorandum.

Critical funding will be lost with the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the agreement. This includes $500 million to improve underfunded and aging hatcheries across the Pacific Northwest and $100 million for wild fish restoration efforts. Much of the promised federal funding would have been disbursed via the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), a federal agency that operates like a business, marketing power from dams on the Columbia River.

Still, many aspects of the agreement will move forward in some form thanks to continued buy-in from state and tribal governments and the committed backing of environmental advocates. “The partnership between our four tribes and the states of Oregon and Washington endures,” said Jeremy Takala, chair of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a tribal councilman of the Yakama Nation, in a statement. “We are still united in the cause of protecting salmon and rivers.”

Amanda Goodin, an attorney at Earthjustice representing the environmental advocates that signed the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, echoed Takala. “The NGOs, states, and tribes are not going to quit on this issue,” she told Truthout. “We’re going to be looking for other avenues for the next few years and waiting for the moment that we have a federal administration that actually cares about our natural heritage, obligations to tribes, and following the law, and we’ll be ready when that time comes.”

Those other avenues are almost sure to include legal battles over the impact of hydroelectric dams on salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Litigation had been ongoing for decades before it was halted as part of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. Federal agencies have lost in court in previous cases. Even John Hairston, administrator and CEO of BPA, welcomed the agreement when it was signed, saying it would help provide “a reliable, affordable power supply to the Pacific Northwest” and put an end to “costly, unpredictable litigation.” Now, Goodin told Truthout, “It’s likely we’re going to see continued litigation.”

Earthjustice is also advocating for Columbia River Basin fish in Congress, where a series of bills have been introduced that could further undermine plans laid out in the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. “Those bills are not just salmon extinction bills, they’re also anti-solution bills,” Cameron Walkup, an associate legal representative working for Earthjustice in Washington, D.C., told Truthoutof the Northwest Energy Security Act, the Defending Our Dams Act, and the Protecting Our Water Energy Resources Act. “These bills would essentially double down on what the president did in June in terms of trying to turn back the clock on progress toward comprehensive solutions for salmon recovery, and also dealing with interconnected issues like making sure we have reliable and affordable energy.”

Columbia Riverkeeper, Earthjustice, and NGO partners are engaged in organizing sign-on campaigns to demonstrate support for dam removal and oppose the harmful bills introduced in Congress. Walkup also told Truthout that his organization is prepared to engage with members of Congress if it appears the bills could garner enough support to come to a hearing. “We’re certainly doing everything we can to uplift all the issues with these bills to make sure that if Republicans do choose to make this part of their agenda, that they’re fully opposed by the Democrats and don’t make it through Congress,” he told Truthout.

For their part, Washington’s state agencies responsible for studying the effects of dam breaching on the lower Snake River are continuing that work even as federal partners have withdrawn. “WDFW, working with the governor’s office, is committed to finding a path forward to restore healthy and abundant salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin in a way that respects and addresses the non-salmon benefits of the river,” Garrity told Truthout.

Johnson of Columbia Riverkeeper said his message to those who are concerned about the Trump administration’s decision to renege on the historic Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement is simple: “We absolutely need our representatives to understand how much people care about salmon and steelhead and having enough fish in our rivers that people can go fishing, we can meet our obligations to tribes and protect tribal cultures,” he told Truthout. “That starts with individuals, businesses, leaders and anyone else making their voices heard. It’s critical to build a groundswell of support.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2191227950-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:57:15.929233

Two people fighting the fire on the Olympic Peninsula were arrested by federal law enforcement Wednesday, as depicted in photos and videos. The two firefighters had entered the U.S. illegally, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Thursday in a news release.

The 9,200-acre wildfire is one of Washington’s largest. The crews, pictured wearing protective clothing and hard hats common on fire lines, were part of the 300-person effort to contain the fire, which started July 6 about 10 miles northwest of Hoodsport, Mason County.

The arrests received swift backlash from elected leaders across the Northwest and nationwide.

Fifty members of Congress questioned the action in a letter Friday to DHS, CBP and the Bureau of Land Management.

“The two arrests and dozens of firefighters temporarily sidelined during an active wildfire raise questions about the priorities and (judgment) exercised by federal agencies,” reads the letter, spearheaded by U.S. Rep. Emily Randall, D-Wash. Randall’s congressional district includes the Olympic Peninsula, where the fire is burning.

The lawmakers specifically seek clarification on Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies regarding arrests in disaster areas. The letter claims standard emergency protocols “shield first responders” who are working in hazardous conditions from ICE. The lawmakers say those protocols weren’t followed.

“The arrest of these hardworking crew members, who put their lives on the line to perform lifesaving duties, is not making our communities safer, no matter the rhetoric you use on TV,” the lawmakers said. “The Trump Administration’s thoughtless and cruel immigration enforcement at any cost undermines coordinated emergency response efforts.”

Federal agents checked the immigration status of firefighters on the active wildfire in a remote location. The agents identified two people who were in the U.S. illegally, a DHS release said, and took them to a detention facility.

Before the arrests, contract fire crews were sent to the northeast side of Lake Cushman. They had been assigned to a Community Hazard Reduction Project, cutting wood to reduce the fuel available for the fire.

The aftermath of the arrests and subsequent outrage saw the Department of Homeland Security claim Friday that the two arrested were not technically firefighters because they were cutting wood.

“The two contracted work crews questioned on the day of their arrests were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood,” the Friday post to X reads.“The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time.”

The U.S. Department of the Interior defines an entry-level wildland firefighter as someone who, among other tasks, chops brush. Forest Service spokesperson Jennifer Risdal did not respond directly to questions about the veracity of the DHS post.

“USDA Forest Service is aware of a Border Patrol operation on the Bear Gulch Fire,” Risdal said in an emailed statement Saturday. “There have been no impacts to firefighting efforts and progress continues to be made on containment.”

The fire was 13% contained as of Saturday afternoon, according to a federal interagency report.

After initially preventing the deportation of the group, Sooknanan, who is based in Washington, DC, widened the order to include all Guatemalan children who had reached the US without a parent or guardian.
“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” the judge said on Sunday, noting that her decision applied broadly to unaccompanied Guatemalan minors.

The order, which was issued on Sunday in response to a complaint filed by a pro-immigrant advocacy group, came as some Guatemalan children were reportedly already put onto planes at a Texas airport and huddled inside.

District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan’s emergency decree followed a petition from the National Immigration Law Center in relation to 10 children aged between 10 and 17.

After initially preventing the deportation of the group, Sooknanan, who is based in Washington, DC, widened the order to include all Guatemalan children who had reached the US without a parent or guardian.

Sooknanan also brought forward a hearing about the issue on Sunday due to reports that some of the children were in the process of being removed from the US during the country’s Labor Day holiday weekend.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” the judge said on Sunday, noting that her decision applied broadly to unaccompanied Guatemalan minors.

The flurry of legal activity came days after reports in the US media that the Trump administration was preparing to start child deportations to Guatemala this weekend, following an agreement with the Central American country.

Such a move would constitute a “clear violation of the unambiguous protections that Congress has provided them as vulnerable children”, according to the National Immigration Law Center’s legal challenge.

Although the children should be under the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the US government was set on “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture”, the complaint added.

On Friday, Guatemala’s Foreign Minister Carlos Martinez confirmed that his country was willing to receive hundreds of children who were in the US.

Since the start of his second presidential term in January, Trump has attempted to start deporting refugees and immigrants en masse.

His administration’s anti-immigration actions, which have included sending hundreds of people to a notorious prison in El Salvador, have been beset by legal difficulties.

Alarm bells raised among immigrant advocates

The episode has raised alarms among immigrant advocates, who say it may represent a violation of federal laws designed to protect children who arrive without their parents.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that an official list had been drafted with the names of Guatemalan children whom the U.S. administration would attempt to send back to their home country.

Trump administration plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. The Guatemalan government has said it is ready to take them in.

It is another step in the Trump administration's sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to send a surge of officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

Lawyers for the Guatemalan children said the U.S. government doesn't have the authority to remove the youngsters and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys' court filing in Washington.

Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is ""illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture,"" argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.

An attorney with another advocacy group, the National Center for Youth Law, said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly from Guatemala — in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities. HSI is ICE's investigative arm.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then, on Friday, advocates across the country began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

The minors can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

Due to their age and often traumatic experiences getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Guatemala says it is willing to receive the unaccompanied minors

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied and are being held in government facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could pass age limits for the children's facilities and be sent to adult detention centers, he said.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said that his government has a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala.

That surge of resources included thousands of National Guard troops who were deployed to the nation’s capital with the stated goal of lowering crime rates.
Following the movement of troops and law enforcement officers to Washington, Trump threatened to send federal officers and troops to other major American cities, including Baltimore.
Later in the Sunday interview, Noem was asked whether Boston would be one of the cities where the federal government would surge immigration enforcement agents.
JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said, “We don’t want troops on the streets of American cities.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Sunday that the Trump administration plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in major cities, including Chicago.

Asked about plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago specifically, Noem told CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” “We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations.”

Asked about what an expansion of ICE operations would look like in Chicago and whether it would involve a mobilization of National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and arrests, Noem demurred, saying, “That always is a prerogative of President [Donald] Trump and his decision. I won’t speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities.”

Her remarks come one day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing his city’s legal department to explore ways to counter a potential surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Illinois.

During a press conference Saturday, Johnson warned that Chicago officials had “received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our cities see some type of militarized activity by the federal government.”

Earlier this month, the Trump administration directed federal law enforcement officers, including those employed by ICE, to assist police in Washington, D.C., with crime-fighting operations. That surge of resources included thousands of National Guard troops who were deployed to the nation’s capital with the stated goal of lowering crime rates.

Following the movement of troops and law enforcement officers to Washington, Trump threatened to send federal officers and troops to other major American cities, including Baltimore.

Later in the Sunday interview, Noem was asked whether Boston would be one of the cities where the federal government would surge immigration enforcement agents.

“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now, and so we haven’t taken anything off the table,” she said, adding later: “I’d encourage every single big city — San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are — if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom like the people of Washington, D.C., are now ... they should call us.”

Other Democratic officials, including a group of over a dozen governors, have condemned plans to deploy troops to their states.

In a statement last week, they said, “Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the President’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members.”

And in an interview that aired Sunday on “Face the Nation,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said, “We don’t want troops on the streets of American cities. That’s un-American. Frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better.”

Pritzker also accused the Trump administration of targeting states run by Democrats rather than those run by Republicans, telling CBS, “Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states. ... Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places, and we’re very proud of the work that we’ve done.”

Asked whether there are plans in place to deploy troops and federal law enforcement officials to states and cities run by Republicans, Noem said, “Absolutely.”

“Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we’ve got operations that, again, I won’t talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we’re doing with a political lens,” she added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250711-kristi-noem-se-1145a-0e97fd.jpg",N,,2025-08-31 16:57:04.171386

This action, described by legal experts as a ""sham lawsuit,"" bypassed the traditional democratic process, raising significant concerns about the integrity of the judicial system and its impact on immigrant rights.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

Ronald White: Trump’s Judicial Rubber Stamp

Instead of engaging in the difficult and public work of repealing a state law through the legislature, the Trump Justice Department and the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office—both aligned against the tuition benefit—collaborated on a pre-determined outcome. They filed a lawsuit not as adversaries, but as ""partners,"" agreeing from the outset to strike down the two-decade-old Oklahoma law.

This coordinated effort was evident when the complaint was filed, immediately followed by a ""Joint Motion for Entry of Consent Judgment."" This move telegraphed their intent: to use the court as a rubber stamp for their shared agenda rather than a forum for genuine legal dispute.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

Public Outcry Ignored

The non-profit legal advocacy group Public Justice attempted to intervene, arguing that the court lacked the fundamental authority, or jurisdiction, to hear such a manufactured case. They highlighted that Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal courts to adjudicating ""actual controversies arising between adverse litigants""—a principle clearly absent in this ""friendly suit."" Public Justice warned that allowing such a proceeding was ""a threat to the democratic process.""

Despite these critical warnings, U.S. District Judge Ronald White, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected Public Justice's request to file an amicus curiae (""friend of the court"") brief, offering no explanation. Shortly thereafter, Judge White approved the ""consent judgment,"" permanently blocking the enforcement of the Oklahoma law. This decision was made without considering any adversarial arguments, effectively silencing those who sought to uphold the democratically enacted statute.

Targeting Migrant Student Tuition Access

At the heart of this legal sidestep was a state law that provided in-state tuition rates for certain undocumented individuals attending college in Oklahoma. For years, this law helped make higher education more accessible to a vulnerable population. The Trump administration and Oklahoma's Attorney General, both known for their stringent anti-immigrant policies, saw this law as a target. Their novel use of the court system allowed them to dismantle this provision without facing the public debate, legislative hurdles, or potential political backlash that a conventional repeal effort would entail.

MY TAKE: This case echoes a similar incident involving U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas, indicating a disturbing trend where federal courts are being used as instruments for political agendas rather than impartial arbiters of justice.

As one Public Justice lawyer noted, even conservative judges traditionally champion strict adherence to jurisdictional rules, making these recent actions particularly alarming.

The concern is clear: without genuine adversarial arguments, courts risk making incorrect decisions and, more importantly, abusing their discretion by deciding issues without hearing both sides.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.","Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats — or around them — as a government shutdown looms.

The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia’s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:

Keeping the Government Open

The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.

Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.

The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.

Senate Nominations Fight

Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump’s nominees.

Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration’s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could “GO TO HELL!”

Republicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.

Russian Sanctions

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won’t move without him.

Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.

“If we don’t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.

Oversight of the CDC

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.

Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez’s lawyers said she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.

Divisions over Epstein

The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump’s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.

Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.

Investigating Biden

The House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden’s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president’s inner circle.

The Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.

Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.

Stock Trading Ban

Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.

That push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents — while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.

Still, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, who said her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. without their parents or guardians.

Minutes after she wrapped up a hastily scheduled hearing Sunday afternoon, five charter buses pulled up to a plane parked at the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in a part of the airport that is restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

The U.S. government contends that it’s reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that’s untrue and argue that, in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

While Sunday’s court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in the nation’s capital, similar emergency requests were filed in other parts of the country. Attorneys in Arizona and Illinois asked federal judges there to block deportations of unaccompanied minors, underscoring how the fight over the government’s efforts has quickly spread.

Immigrant advocates react

The episode has raised alarms among immigrant advocates, who say it may represent a violation of federal laws designed to protect children who arrive without their parents.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that an official list had been drafted with the names of Guatemalan children whom the U.S. administration would attempt to send back to their home country. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

She said she’d heard that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials “were still taking the children,” having not gotten any guidance about the court order.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

Plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. The Guatemalan government has said it is ready to take them in.

It is another step in the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to send a surge of officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

Lawyers for the Guatemalan children said the U.S. government doesn’t have the authority to remove the youngsters and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys’ court filing in Washington.

Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture,” argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.

An attorney with another advocacy group, the National Center for Youth Law, said the organization started hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that agents from Homeland Security Investigations — ICE’s investigative arm — were interviewing children, particularly from Guatemala, in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then on Friday, advocates across the country began getting word that their young clients’ immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

The minors can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

Due to their age and often traumatic experiences getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Guatemala willing to receive the unaccompanied minors

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied and are being held in government facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could pass age limits for the children’s facilities and be sent to adult detention centers, he said.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said that his government has a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bdc20c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1955x1026+0+126/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F25%2F6b%2F242919054c24b427ed7b7af34a95%2F0a67ac3f222c448e9f475e1cb48cf99e.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 15:56:55.377655

The U.S. government insists it's reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that's nonsense and argue that in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

One girl said her parents, in Guatemala, got a strange phone call a few weeks ago saying the U.S. was deporting her, said one of the attorneys, Efrén C. Olivares of the National Immigration Law Center. Other children – identified only by their initials – said in court documents that they had been neglected, abandoned, physically threatened or abused in their home country.

Sunday's court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, but similar legal actions also were filed elsewhere.

In a lawsuit in Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project said one of its clients is a 12-year-old asylum-seeker who has chronic kidney disease, needs dialysis to stay alive and will need a kidney transplant. Two other plaintiffs, a 10-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister, don't have family in Guatemala and don't want to return, according to the group.

Families scramble to Guatemalan air base

As the developments played out in the U.S., families gathered at an air base in Guatemala’s capital, Guatemala City, in anticipation of the flights. Gilberto López said he drove through the night from his remote town after his 17-year-old nephew called at midnight, saying that he was being deported from Texas.

The boy left Guatemala two years ago, at age 15, to work in the U.S. and was detained about a month ago, López said.

Alarm bells for immigrant advocates

Migrant children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents or guardians are routinely handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. They often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor – usually a relative – living in the country.

Many of those from Guatemala request asylum or pursue other legal avenues to get permission to stay the U.S.

An attorney with the National Center for Youth Law said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children – particularly Guatemalans – in facilities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then, on Friday, advocates began getting word that their young clients’ immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that officials had drafted a list of children to return to Guatemala. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

It's unclear whether any planes actually departed. Government lawyer Drew Ensign told the Washington judge that one plane might have taken off but then returned.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.

The judge said that after being awakened at 2:30 a.m. to address the emergency filing from the children's lawyers, she spent hours trying to reach federal attorneys and get answers.

“I have the government attempting to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend, which is surprising,” Sooknanan said at the hearing, later adding: “Absent action by the courts, all of those children would have been returned to Guatemala, potentially to very dangerous situations.”

The rapid-fire developments resembled a March weekend showdown over the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Advocates implored a federal judge to halt deportations they believed were imminent, while the Trump administration was mum about its plans.

That judge appeared in civilian clothes for a Saturday night hearing and tried to block the flights, but they went ahead, with the government saying the order came too late.

On Saturday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order barring the city's police department from collaborating with federal officers conducting civil immigration enforcement operations, and with U.S. military personnel on police patrols.

Johnson, a Democrat, said Trump was acting outside ""the bounds of the Constitution"" by threatening to send more federal law enforcement officers or even the National Guard to Chicago against the wishes of state and local leaders.

""We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart,"" Johnson said. ""We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents.""

President Trump, in a post on his social media site Truth Social on Saturday, criticized Illinois' Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker and suggested federal forces could be dispatched to the Midwest city to fight crime.

""Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME,"" Trump wrote. ""He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!""

The Trump administration recently deployed National Guard members to the streets of Washington, D.C. in an effort to reduce crime in the nation's capital.

On Sunday, Pritzker said on CBS's Face the Nation that the possibility of sending the U.S. military to the streets of an American city amounts to an ""attack on the American people by the President of the United States.""

Pritzker also said Trump also had ""other aims"" besides simply fighting crime, such as disrupting the 2026 midterm elections. ""He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control, if in fact he's allowed to do this,"" the governor said.

Though Trump himself has tied crime to a possible increase of federal forces in Chicago, the administration is expected to characterize the surge of law enforcement resources as focused specifically on immigration enforcement, the Associated Press reported.

White House ""border czar"" Tom Homan said last week that there would be a ""ramp-up"" of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and other cities, including New York and Los Angeles.

""All these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] where we know public safety threats are being released every day into this country — especially in those cities — we're going to address that,"" Homan told reporters.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that the government intends to ""add more resources"" to ongoing ICE operations in Chicago but did not disclose any details.

Last week the Trump administration asked the Naval Station Great Lakes for support with immigration operations, including ""facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,"" according to the AP.

Under Mayor Johnson's order, Chicago Police Department officers will also have to wear official police uniforms and will be prohibited from wearing face masks so city residents can distinguish them from federal officers, he said. (A DHS spokesperson previously told NPR that some immigration agents wear masks to protect themselves from increasing threats.)

On Sunday, the White House criticized Johnson's executive order.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. ""Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue, but Democrats suffering from TDS are trying to make it one. They should listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser who recently celebrated the Trump Administration's success in driving down violent crime in Washington DC.""

Johnson said he believed the immigration crackdown could begin as early as Friday.

It’s where, Abrego Garcia alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation and psychological torture.
His team says he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia ’s request for asylum in the United States is a prudent legal strategy, experts say, because it gives his lawyers better options for fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to deport him.

But it’s also a gamble. Depending on how the courts rule, Abrego Garcia could end up back inside the notorious El Salvador prison where he says he was beaten and psychologically tortured.

“It’s a strategic move,” Memphis-based immigration attorney Andrew Rankin said of the asylum request. “And it can certainly backfire. But it’s something I would do as well if I were representing him.”

Abrego Garcia, 30, became a focus of President Trump’s immigration crackdown when he was wrongfully deported to his native country in March. The administration is trying to deport him again.

Here are some things to know about his case:

‘You can’t win every case’

The administration deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador because U.S. officials said he was an MS-13 gang member. It’s an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he wasn’t charged.

His removal to El Salvador violated a U.S. immigration judge’s ruling from 2019 that barred his deportation there. The judge found that Abrego Garcia faced credible threats from a local gang that had extorted from and terrorized his family.

Following a U.S. Supreme Court order, the administration returned him to the United States in June. But it was only to face human smuggling charges, which his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The administration has said it now intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and the main architect of Trump’s immigration policies, told reporters Friday that Garcia has “said he doesn’t want to go back to El Salvador.”

Miller said the administration is “honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.”

In an effort to fight back, Abrego Garcia has notified the U.S. government that he fears being sent to Uganda, which has documented human rights abuses. He said he believes he could be persecuted, tortured or sent from there to El Salvador.

But even if he thwarts deportation to Uganda in immigration court, he probably will face attempts to remove him to another country and then another until the administration succeeds, Rankin said.

“By the law of averages, you can’t win every case,” the lawyer said. “The government has sunk its teeth far into what they’re doing with Kilmar and immigration in general, that it wouldn’t make any sense for them to just give up the fight.”

Taking a risk

Asylum, however, could end the fight.

The request would place the focus solely back on his native El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia has previously shown that he has a credible fear of gang persecution.

But he’s taking a risk by reopening his 2019 immigration case, Rankin said. If he loses the bid for asylum, an immigration judge could remove his protection from being returned to his native country.

That could place him back in the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECO, in El Salvador. It’s where, Abrego Garcia alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation and psychological torture. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has denied those allegations.

Abrego Garcia had applied for asylum in 2019. The immigration judge denied his request because it came more than a year after Abrego Garcia had arrived in the U.S. He had fled to Maryland without documentation around 2011.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers will probably argue that he has the right to request asylum now because he has been in the U.S. for less than a year after being wrongfully deported to El Salvador, Rankin said.

If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship.

‘Not going to let this go’

Abrego Garcia’s asylum petition would go through the U.S. immigration court system, which is not part of the judiciary but an arm of the Department of Justice and under the Trump administration’s authority.

That’s where the risk comes in.

Abrego Garcia has a team of lawyers fighting for him, unlike many people who are facing deportation. And a federal judge is monitoring his immigration case.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland to ensure he can exercise his constitutional rights to fight against deportation in immigration court.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis cannot rule on whether he gets asylum or is deported, but she said she will ensure his right to due process. His team says he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

“Even if he does manage to win asylum, the government is going to appeal,” Rankin said. “They’re not going to let this go. Why would they after they’ve invested months and months into this one guy?”

Rankin noted that if Abrego Garcia remains within the jurisdiction of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that court’s laws would govern his asylum claim. He said that court has been generally positive toward asylum claims and likely would give Abrego Garcia a “fair shake.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6eff3aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4835x2538+0+343/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbc%2Ff6%2Fba2e658940cda551c99b3c4ea0d3%2F4a979dfbc97541e28aa6e89d7a56a40e.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:59:12.329177

March for Australia rallies against immigration were being held in Sydney and other state capitals and regional centers, according to the group’s website.

“Mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together,” the website says. The group posted on X on Saturday that the rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration.”

Australia – where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas – has been grappling with a rise in right-wing extremism, including protests by neo-Nazis.

“We absolutely condemn the March for Australia rally that’s going on today. It is not about increasing social harmony,” Murray Watt, a senior minister in the Labor government, told Sky News television, when asked about the rally in Sydney, the country’s most-populous city.

“We don’t support rallies like this that are about spreading hate and that are about dividing our community,” Watt said, asserting they were “organized and promoted” by neo-Nazi groups.

March for Australia organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the neo-Nazi claims.

Counter-protesters express ‘disgust’

Some 5,000 to 8,000 people, many draped in Australian flags, had assembled for the Sydney rally, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported. It was held near the course of the Sydney Marathon, where 35,000 runners pounded the streets on Sunday, finishing at the city’s Opera House.

Also nearby, a counter-rally by the Refugee Action Coalition, a community activist organization, took place.

“Our event shows the depth of disgust and anger about the far-right agenda of March For Australia,” a coalition spokesperson said in a statement. Organizers said hundreds attended that event.

A large March for Australia rally was held in central Melbourne, the capital of Victoria state, according to aerial footage from the ABC, which reported that riot officers used pepper spray on demonstrators. Victoria Police did not confirm the report but said it would provide details on the protest later on Sunday.

Bob Katter, the leader of a small populist party, was attending a March for Australia rally in Queensland, a party spokesperson said, three days after the veteran lawmaker threatened a reporter for mentioning Katter’s Lebanese heritage at a press conference when the topic of his attendance at a March for Australia was being discussed.

In Sydney, March for Australia protester Glenn Allchin said he wanted a “slowdown” in immigration.

“It’s about our country bursting at the seams and our government bringing more and more people in,” Allchin told Reuters. “Our kids struggling to get homes, our hospitals, we have to wait seven hours, our roads, the lack of roads.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2232950741.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-31 13:59:17.242864

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.","Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats — or around them — as a government shutdown looms.

The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia’s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:

Keeping the Government Open

The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.

Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.

The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.

Senate Nominations Fight

Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump’s nominees.

Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration’s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could “GO TO HELL!”

Republicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.

Russian Sanctions

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won’t move without him.

Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.

“If we don’t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.

Oversight of the CDC

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.

Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez’s lawyers said she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.

Divisions over Epstein

The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump’s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.

Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.

Investigating Biden

The House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden’s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president’s inner circle.

The Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.

Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.

Stock Trading Ban

Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.

That push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents — while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.

Still, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.

Noem's comments come after the DHS last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency's anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during an appearance CBS News' ”Face the Nation.""

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago's crime problems quickly “or we're coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker have pushed back against the expected federal mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

Johnson has already signed an order barring the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and the state at odds with Trump’s administration as it tries to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Pritzker in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation” charged that Trump's expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of immigration protests in the California city.

“Federal law prohibits the use of U.S. Military for domestic law enforcement except in extraordinary circumstances — which do not exist in Chicago,” the order said.

Crime in Chicago has fallen in nearly every major category over the past year, according to city figures, and murders are down 50 percent from their peak during the pandemic.

At a news conference last week alongside other city and state leaders, Mayor Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who are both Democrats, denounced Mr. Trump’s threat to send troops. But Mr. Trump repeated his threat in a social media post on Saturday, saying the governor needed to take action to prevent crime “or we’re coming!”

Mr. Johnson’s executive order said that federal agents should comply with city policies that prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks to intentionally disguise or conceal their identities. It also calls for the city to take steps to ensure that residents know their rights when encountering federal agents.

“We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government,” Mr. Johnson told reporters on Saturday. “We have not called for this.”

Chicago has clashed with the Trump administration over the city’s sanctuary laws for immigrants. Illinois and Chicago limit how city agencies may interact with federal immigration authorities; the White House says that a lack of cooperation at the local and state levels impedes federal immigration enforcement efforts.

The court forbade the administration from deporting the children, who are as young as 10, for 14 days.

Even so, dozens of children were removed by immigration authorities from shelters overnight and were gathered in preparation to be placed on chartered planes to Guatemala, according to officials with knowledge of the situation.

The judge’s order could temporarily hamstring the federal government’s attempts to return to Guatemala hundreds of unaccompanied minors who have been in U.S. custody after crossing the southern border.

On Sunday morning, after the temporary restraining order was issued, shelters holding children received a letter from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement stating that the agency was responsible for the care and custody of the children, and that the shelters must comply with the agency’s directives.

The officials with knowledge of the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from the government, said that dozens of children were removed from shelters in the early morning hours Sunday.

Though the judge’s order is temporary, it is the second recent setback for President Trump’s immigration policies. On Friday, another judge blocked the administration from carrying out rapid deportations far from the border, a cornerstone of the White House’s immigration policy.

The lawsuit over the Guatemalan children was filed after staff members at shelters that were holding the children were notified by email on Saturday that they should prepare some of them to be sent back to Guatemala. Lawyers representing some of the children received a similar email.

In its 25-page complaint, the National Immigration Law Center said that the children had active cases before immigration courts across the country, and that their repatriation would violate federal law and the Constitution. It called the government’s actions “unlawful and reckless.”

Ten children are identified by their initials in the lawsuit. All of them have cases pending in immigration courts and have told judges that they are afraid to return to Guatemala, the lawsuit says.

The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States has plummeted since Mr. Trump began his second term. Migrant children have posed a particular challenge to the Trump administration because they are entitled to special protections.

Hundreds of thousands of children, mainly from Central America, have crossed the southern border into the United States in the last decade, often seeking to join friends or relatives. Many of the minors have won the right to remain in the United States permanently by proving that they were abandoned or persecuted in their home countries.

The move to repatriate the Guatemalan children has the backing of the Guatemalan government. Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, said on Friday that his country had been coordinating with the United States. and expected to receive more than 600 minors.

When unaccompanied children entering the United States are taken into custody, they typically remain in shelters until they are released to sponsors or guardians once those adults have been vetted. The children the Trump administration is seeking to deport have been awaiting release from the shelters.

Lawyers fighting the removal of unaccompanied minors have cited the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which provides special protections for unaccompanied minors who seek refuge in the United States, including the opportunity to have their cases adjudicated by a court.

“We are very concerned that our clients could be returned to unsafe situations,” said Ms. Sendukas, managing attorney with the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project.

He also reiterated his intention to restrict mail-in voting except for those who are very ill or serving far away in the military, as well as his opposition to voting machines.

The announcement signals Mr. Trump’s latest effort to influence election laws using an executive order, something that he has dubious authority to do. The Constitution gives the president no explicit authority to regulate elections. Rather, it gives states the power to decide the rules of elections, oversee voting and try to prevent fraud. It gives Congress the ability to override state laws on voting. Any executive order from the president regarding elections is likely to see immediate legal challenges.

Mr. Trump and his allies have started a wide-ranging effort to gain any advance they can ahead of midterm elections, which are set for November 2026.

Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said that a team of lawyers were preparing an executive order to end all mail-in ballots and wrote on social media that the executive order would “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.” He has long opposed mail-in voting and falsely claimed it was a source of fraud after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joseph R. Biden Jr.

In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to require people to show government-issued proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The order was swiftly challenged in court, and a federal judge blocked the vast majority of the order in June.

The judge, Denise J. Casper of the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sided with states that had sued to stop the requirements, writing in her judgment that the states were likely to succeed in showing that the order exceeded Mr. Trump’s authority and risked disenfranchising some of the electorate. Judge Casper was appointed by President Obama.

“The Constitution does not grant the president any specific powers over elections,” she wrote.

After a call with White House officials and a logo change earlier this week, the company unwoked itself to President Trump’s liking.

“Congratulations Cracker Barrel!” read the statement from Mr. Trump, who celebrated the old barrel man’s return to the logo. “All of your fans very much appreciate it.”

It used to be that you could switch off the so-called culture wars, or at least find a place to mute them for a little while. Cracker Barrel was actually one of those places. But now, not even something as low stakes as a company’s logo can escape the gaze of a president bent on changing — or forcing — American life to reflect his own views and tastes, which often mirror the far-right ideological movement that fueled his rise.

The White House declined to comment on why this matter was worthy of the president’s time, and why officials had held the call with Cracker Barrel. But an official passed on a statement from Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, who praised the president’s “unmatched business instincts.”

The logo debacle seems like a small thing, but really, it shows how Mr. Trump is now using his power to reshape all aspects of American culture, not just American policy. He has not hesitated to retaliate against those who disagree.

He has effectively taken over the Kennedy Center, where he will decide what art is appropriate to receive national recognition, and where he will host the annual awards ceremony. (No “wokesters,” he said of the recipients.) He is reviewing Smithsonian museums and exhibits “to assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.” He issued an executive order requiring that all future federal buildings eschew modernist architecture. He called in the National Guard to control Washington’s crime, and now its members, some with little to do, are spreading mulch in parks downtown.

He has returned to earlier threats to investigate or exert control over television networks. After crowing over the cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” whose host is an ardent critic, Mr. Trump vowed to investigate NBC over extending the contract of the late-night host Seth Meyers. (His contract was extended before Mr. Trump took office for the second time.)

Golf buddies have also been given the benefit of the presidential bullhorn. Mr. Trump has demanded that Roger Clemens, the former major-league pitcher whose career was overshadowed by steroid suspicions, be elected to the Hall of Fame, “NOW.” (Mr. Clemens played golf with the president recently.)

Turn off the television and he’ll turn up at your college football game talking about transgender people in sports. Try to do some doomscrolling on Instagram and there’s Sydney Sweeney, she of the “Good jeans” American Eagle ad. Mr. Trump proudly claimed recently that she is a registered Republican with the “HOTTEST” commercial going. Mute social media and he’ll be onstage at the Kennedy Center, praising the physique of Sylvester Stallone.

Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard who studies authoritarianism and threats to democracies, said that Mr. Trump’s impulses have led to unprecedented attacks on American institutions, and that the early months of his term appear to have emboldened him.

“We have a lot of muscle in American society,” Mr. Levitsky said. “It’s a very wealthy society and a lot of highly skilled lawyers, and it is well organized. The United States has the raw materials to push back. It’s just not doing it.”

Mr. Levitsky predicted that Americans might be finding the cultural overreach into their homes and televisions and social media accounts “annoying.” But he said there was little to stop the president from continuing his disruptive cultural campaign.

Mr. Trump’s criticisms and demands have evolved since he was a pop culture obsessive who lived on Twitter to comment on the news of the day. When he entered the White House, he used the presidential bully pulpit to attack a dizzying range of critics, from celebrities to former members of his first presidential administration.

In some cases, the line between his political opponents living under mere threat of retaliation and those actually facing it is growing thinner.

A number of former Trump administration officials whom Mr. Trump has considered insufficiently loyal have had their Secret Service details pulled, including Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the former government scientist. They are part of a growing list of Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, who’ve also had their details revoked.

A number of other perceived enemies of Mr. Trump are facing investigations, including Lisa Cook, a Fed governor the president has accused of mortgage fraud. (She has not been charged with a crime.)

Others have been threatened without evidence, including former President Barack Obama, whom Mr. Trump has accused of undermining his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Obama’s office called those claims a “weak attempt at distraction.”

Even his old pop-culture Twitter foils have faced increasingly dark threats. Rosie O’Donnell, a longtime and very vocal Trump critic, is now living in Ireland. Mr. Trump has mused about revoking her American citizenship, which is unconstitutional.

One former target who got off relatively easy was Taylor Swift, the pop star who recently announced her engagement to Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs. Ms. Swift did not endorse Mr. Trump, and he has attacked her before. This week, in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Mr. Trump magnanimously offered her good luck with her engagement. But not before pointedly wishing Mr. Kelce good luck.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/31/multimedia/31trump-1215-twgz/31trump-1215-twgz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 12:56:41.032615

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.","Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats — or around them — as a government shutdown looms.

The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia’s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:

The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.

Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.

The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.

Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump's nominees.

Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration's positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could ""GO TO HELL!""

Republicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump's closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia's invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won't move without him.

Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.

""If we don't have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,"" Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.

Health and Human Service Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.

Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez's lawyers said she refused ""to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.""

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.

The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump's administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.

Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.

The House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president's inner circle.

The Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.

Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.

Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.

That push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents — while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.

Still, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.

Asked which of Cottrell’s criticisms were wrong, Tice replied: “All of it’s wrong.” He said: “I enjoy the church, I believe in God.
But the role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies.” Farage’s new asylum policy involves deporting asylum seekers who cross the Channel, even to countries such as Afghanistan and Eritrea.
The party has struggled to answer detailed questions about how the policy would work and how much it would cost.
Asked on Sunday whether its role would be simply to act as observers while small boats continued to cross, Tice replied: “Yes.","Reform UK has engaged in a war of words with the Church of England over the party’s plans to deport all asylum seekers who arrive in small boats, after the church’s most senior bishop called the proposal “isolationist, short-term [and] kneejerk”.

Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader, hit back against the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, on Sunday, accusing him of interfering in domestic politics.

This week Nigel Farage, Reform’s leader, announced the party’s migration policy, under which Britain would leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and deport people who arrive or have recently arrived by small boat from France.

Cottrell told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips: “We should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short-term, kneejerk – in this case, ‘send them home’. Mr Farage is saying the things he’s saying but he is not offering any long-term solution to the big issues which are convulsing our world, which lead to this.”

Responding on the same show, Tice rejected the criticism and urged the bishop, who is the acting head of the church while it searches for a new archbishop of Canterbury, to stay out of migration policy.

Asked which of Cottrell’s criticisms were wrong, Tice replied: “All of it’s wrong.”

He said: “I enjoy the church, I believe in God. But the role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies.”

Farage’s new asylum policy involves deporting asylum seekers who cross the Channel, even to countries such as Afghanistan and Eritrea. To do so, Reform is promising to take Britain out of the ECHR, the 1951 refugee convention, the UN convention against torture and the Council of Europe anti-trafficking convention.

A Reform government would then send teams of immigration officials into communities across the country to find people who have settled here after arriving as irregular migrants and deport them as well.

The party has struggled to answer detailed questions about how the policy would work and how much it would cost. Farage initially said women and children would be detained and deported as well as men, but a day later he appeared to row back on that, suggesting doing so was not “part of our plan”.

Asked by the Guardian why he had costed the proposals at £10bn when a thinktank had priced a similar plan by his former colleague Rupert Lowe at £47.5bn, Farage responded: “Zia [Yusuf, the senior Reform official] is very good at maths.”

Reform has also talked about deploying the navy to help it enforce its migration plans. Asked on Sunday whether its role would be simply to act as observers while small boats continued to cross, Tice replied: “Yes. In a sense, that’s what the Border Force are currently.”

Reform is looking to keep the pressure on the government to close asylum hotels even after a court ruled that ministers could continue to use the Bell hotel in Epping to house people whose claims had not yet been processed.

Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said on Sunday that the government would look to close hotels in an “orderly” way by the end of the parliament. “We can’t end up with hundreds of people just out on the street because a hotel has closed,” she said.

Separately, she appeared to put pressure on the prime minister and the chancellor to end the two-child benefit cap, which Cottrell warned was driving up child poverty.

“I’m ashamed of the very high numbers of children growing up in poverty that we see in our country,” she said, adding that bringing that level down was “what I came into politics to do”.

Asked specifically about the benefit cap, she said: “It’s not the only way we can lift children out of poverty, and of course, it does come with a big price tag. But we know that not acting also comes with serious consequences and impact too.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da5d3f4b8946d88d37ce3c9d06de08c75429d982/344_0_3440_2752/master/3440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=448b1eac92128287a4b09f7d37a802b3",N,,2025-08-31 11:56:32.406509

It comes after party leader Nigel Farage announced Reform's flagship immigration plan during a flashy news conference held at an aircraft hangar in Oxford on Tuesday.

The party pledged to deport anybody who comes to the UK illegally, regardless of whether they might come to harm, and said it would pay countries with questionable human rights records - such as Afghanistan - to take people back.

It also said it would leave numerous international agreements, and revoke the Human Rights Act, in order to do this.

The policy was criticised by the Conservatives, who said Mr Farage was ""copying our homework"", while parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens condemned it.

But the plan came under fire from an altogether different angle on Saturday, when the Archbishop of York accused it of being an ""isolationist, short-term kneejerk"" approach, with no ""long-term solutions"".

Mr Cottrell told the same Sky News programme he had ""every sympathy"" with those who find the issue of immigration tricky. But he said Reform UK's plan did ""nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country"", and would in fact, make ""the problem worse"".

On Sunday, Mr Tice responded to the archbishop's criticisms, saying that ""all of it is wrong"".

The MP for Boston and Skegness said he was a Christian who ""enjoys"" the church - but that the ""role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies"".

Mr Tice then turned his fire on the government, accusing ministers of being ""more interested in protecting the rights of people who've come here illegally... than looking after the rights of British citizens"".

He accused ministers of having ""abandoned"" their duty of ""looking after the interests of British citizens"".

Mr Tice reaffirmed his party's policy that the UK should leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), calling it a ""70-year-old, out-of-date, unfit-for-purpose agreement"".

The Reform UK deputy leader also:

• Defended plans to pay the Taliban to take migrants back, comparing it to doing business deals with ""people you don't like""

• Said the Royal Navy should be deployed in the English Channel as a ""deterrent"", but added: ""We're not saying sink the boats""

• Urged the government to call an early general election

Meanwhile, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told Sky News that Reform ""want to provoke anger, but they don't actually want to solve the problems that we face in front of us"".

She told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the UK had a ""proud tradition [of] supporting those facing persecution"".

But she added: ""We will make sure that people who have no right to be in this country are removed from this country. That's right. It's what people expect. It's what this government will deliver.""

Ms Phillipson also insisted there ""needs to be reform of the ECHR"" and said the home secretary is ""looking at the article eight provisions"", which cover the right to a private and family life, to see ""whether they need updating and reforming for the modern age"".

However, she refused to say what the government would do if it is found that the ECHR is unreformable. Instead, she defended Labour's position of staying in the governance of the convention, saying that honouring the ""rule of law"" is important.

She added: ""Our standing in the world matters if we want to strike trade deals with countries. We need to be a country that's taken seriously. We need to be a country that honours our obligations and honours the rule of law.""

Ms Phillipson was also drawn on the recent court ruling in favour of the Home Office, which overturned an injunction banning The Bell Hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers.

Challenged on whether the government is prioritising the rights of asylum seekers over British citizens, she said it ""is about a balance of rights"".

The cabinet minister also repeated the government's plans to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029.

Shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the Conservatives would be willing to leave the ECHR - if this route is recommended to them.

The Tories have asked a senior judge to look into the ""legal intricacies"" of leaving the convention, which he said is ""not straightforward"". He said when the party receives that report, it will then make a decision.

Challenged on whether the Tories will leave if that is what the report recommends, he added: ""If that's what's necessary, we will do it.""

Mr Burghart also said he believed the previous Conservative government's biggest mistake was that ""we did not go far enough on overruling human rights legislation"", which prevented it from ""taking the tough action that was absolutely necessary"".

Sundance, Inc., 596 U.S. 411 (2022) Eliminated the extra arbitration-specific requirement that a party opposing arbitration must show prejudice; arbitration contracts must be treated like other contracts.
Filing a merits motion to dismiss with prejudice before invoking arbitration presumptively constitutes FAA “default.” No prejudice requirement: After Morgan, a plaintiff need not show prejudice.
State–federal division of labor: Even where contracts choose state law, the FAA’s procedural “default” rule controls federal court enforcement.
State arbitration law vs. FAA: State law can set substantive contract rules (e.g., what counts as a waiver under state contract law).
Key Takeaways Merits motions before arbitration = FAA “default.” No prejudice showing required post–Morgan.","Introduction

This published decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit clarifies and sharpens the law governing when a litigant loses the ability to enforce an arbitration agreement by litigating in court. In Valerie Kloosterman v. Metropolitan Hospital, No. 24-1398 (6th Cir. Aug. 27, 2025), the court held that a defendant who first seeks “an immediate and total victory” on the merits—via a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal with prejudice—and only later moves to compel arbitration is in “default in proceeding with such arbitration” within the meaning of Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That default bars both a stay under Section 3 and an order compelling arbitration under Section 4.

The parties are a long-serving physician assistant, Valerie Kloosterman, and Metropolitan Hospital (University of Michigan Health-West) and several of its officials. After the district court partially denied defendants’ motions to dismiss Kloosterman’s First Amendment and Title VII claims, defendants—for the first time, after a year of litigation—moved to compel arbitration based on an employment agreement. The district court granted the motion. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that defendants’ litigation tactics extinguished their FAA right to arbitrate.

Beyond deciding this case, the court set a clear, administrable rule: a merits-based motion to dismiss with prejudice, pursued before raising arbitration, is conduct “completely inconsistent” with reliance on an arbitration agreement and places the movant in FAA “default.” The opinion also harmonizes post–Morgan v. Sundance doctrine in the Sixth Circuit, connects Section 3’s “default” to Section 4, and addresses the relationship between federal procedural rules under the FAA and state arbitration law.

Summary of the Judgment

The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court’s order compelling arbitration and dismissing the case.

Holding: Defendants lost their right to arbitrate under the FAA because they litigated on the merits for a year—twice moving to dismiss all claims with prejudice and opposing an amendment as “futile”—before invoking arbitration. That conduct put them in “default in proceeding with such arbitration” under 9 U.S.C. § 3.

The court clarified that the same “default” limitation applies whether a party seeks a stay under Section 3 or an order compelling arbitration under Section 4; litigants cannot avoid Section 3’s default by styling the request under Section 4.

Prejudice is not required (post–Morgan v. Sundance), and the defendants’ conduct here was “entirely inconsistent” with arbitration.

The court rejected the argument that Michigan’s arbitration statute displaced the FAA’s procedural “default” rule in federal court; state law may govern substantive contract waiver, but the FAA governs procedural enforcement in federal court.

The case is remanded for litigation to proceed in district court.

9 U.S.C. §§ 3–4 (Federal Arbitration Act)

Section 3 directs courts to stay cases pending arbitration, “providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.” The panel grounds its rule in the statutory word “default” and its ordinary legal meaning.

Section 4 permits courts to compel arbitration. Drawing on longstanding doctrine, the court holds the same procedural limits—including “default”—apply to both §§ 3 and 4, preventing an end-run by labeling.

Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., 596 U.S. 411 (2022)

Eliminated the extra arbitration-specific requirement that a party opposing arbitration must show prejudice; arbitration contracts must be treated like other contracts. The Sixth Circuit accordingly jettisons the prejudice prong and focuses on inconsistency with an intent to arbitrate.

Schwebke v. United Wholesale Mortg. LLC, 96 F.4th 971 (6th Cir. 2024)

Recognized Morgan’s removal of the prejudice requirement; left open labels (waiver/forfeiture). The panel here again avoids labels but applies the inconsistency/default standard.

Solo v. UPS, 947 F.3d 968 (6th Cir. 2020)

Anchors the “entirely inconsistent” conduct test. Moving to dismiss on the merits before invoking arbitration is paradigmatically inconsistent—defendants cannot “play heads I win, tails you lose.” The panel relies heavily on this logic.

American Locomotive Co. v. Chemical Research Corp., 171 F.2d 115 (6th Cir. 1948) and American Locomotive Co. v. Gyro Process Co., 185 F.2d 316 (6th Cir. 1950)

Early Sixth Circuit authority finding parties in § 3 “default” by litigating for years; also applying the same default analysis to deny relief under § 4. The panel uses these cases to reinforce that Sections 3 and 4 rise and fall together on “default.”

Smith v. Spizzirri, 601 U.S. 472 (2024)

Held that if a party requests a stay under § 3, the district court must stay (not dismiss). The panel notes neither party requested a stay here and underscores correct procedural posture for future cases.

Other circuits aligning with the “no wait-and-see” rule:

Third Circuit: White v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc., 61 F.4th 334 (3d Cir. 2023) – losing on early motions then pivoting to arbitration forfeits the right.

Seventh Circuit: Smith v. GC Servs. Ltd. P’ship, 907 F.3d 495 (7th Cir. 2018) – similar “erase the loss” concerns; merits motions then arbitration barred.

Eighth Circuit: Parker v. Kearney Sch. Dist., 130 F.4th 649 (8th Cir. 2025) – unsuccessful merits motions followed by belated arbitration request triggers loss of the right.

Distinguishing contrary authorities:

Rush v. Oppenheimer (2d Cir. 1985): Mixed arbitrable/nonarbitrable claims can justify limited merits motions. Not applicable where all claims are said to be arbitrable, as here.

ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v. IBT (8th Cir. 2013): Jurisdictional (non-merits) dismissal without prejudice is not inconsistent with arbitration.

Williams v. Cigna Fin. Advisors (5th Cir. 1995): Claimed late discovery of the clause. Sixth Circuit notes its own cases do not excuse untimeliness based on a bare mistake, and a party cannot be ignorant of its own contract.

Erie/choice-of-law scaffolding:

Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624 (2009): State contract law governs who can enforce an arbitration clause; supports the opinion’s division between state substantive contract principles and federal procedural enforcement under the FAA.

Gasperini, 518 U.S. 415 (1996) and Shady Grove, 559 U.S. 393 (2010): Federal courts apply state substantive law and federal procedural law; the FAA’s procedural default rule applies in federal court even when a contract adopts state substantive law.

Legal Reasoning

The panel places the analysis squarely within the text of the FAA: a court may stay litigation “providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration” (9 U.S.C. § 3). “Default” is given its ordinary legal meaning—failing to live up to a duty or promise through neglect or otherwise. A party that affirmatively seeks a merits judgment in court—particularly a dismissal with prejudice—is not “proceeding with such arbitration.” It is renouncing it. That conduct is “completely inconsistent” with any intent to arbitrate.

The court reasons further that the same “default” limitation governs motions to compel under § 4, relying on historic practice and Supreme Court guidance that §§ 3 and 4 share procedural guardrails. Otherwise, litigants could circumvent § 3’s limitation simply by avoiding the word “stay.”

The Sixth Circuit applies its pre-Morgan “inconsistency” prong, stripped of the now-defunct prejudice requirement. Two features made the inconsistency unmistakable here:

Defendants twice moved to dismiss all claims “with prejudice,” which would foreclose arbitration entirely.

Defendants only sought arbitration after the district court ruled against them in part—i.e., after a “sneak peek” at the case’s prospects in court.

Other conduct—participating in discovery planning and choosing a discovery plan—reinforced the conclusion that the hospital elected a judicial forum. By contrast, the court emphasized that purely jurisdictional motions (e.g., lack of subject-matter jurisdiction) do not necessarily conflict with arbitration because they do not seek a merits resolution “that resolves the dispute.”

On choice-of-law, the court rejects the argument that Michigan’s arbitration statute displaces the FAA’s “default” rule in federal court. Even if state law defines substantive waiver of contract rights, the FAA governs the procedural entitlement to federal relief (stay or compel) and imposes the “default” limit. The hospital had, moreover, invoked § 4 of the FAA in the district court, confirming the applicability of federal procedures.

The court also corrects the procedural vehicle: a “motion for summary judgment to compel arbitration” is a misnomer. Although summary-judgment standards can govern factual disputes about formation or scope of an arbitration agreement, the correct mechanism is a § 3 motion to stay or a § 4 motion to compel, not a merits judgment.

Impact

This decision has immediate and practical consequences for arbitration practice in the Sixth Circuit and persuasive force beyond:

Bright-line guidance on timing: Parties who wish to arbitrate must say so early and unequivocally. Filing a merits motion to dismiss with prejudice before invoking arbitration presumptively constitutes FAA “default.”

No prejudice requirement: After Morgan, a plaintiff need not show prejudice. The focus is on the defendant’s inconsistency with arbitration.

One rule for §§ 3 and 4: Litigants cannot avoid § 3’s default limit by moving to compel under § 4. If you are in default, you cannot compel either.

Procedural posture matters:

Do: Move to stay under § 3, expressly requesting a stay (post–Spizzirri, courts must stay if requested).

Do: Limit early motions to threshold jurisdictional issues if necessary; avoid merits determinations.

Don’t: Seek a merits dismissal with prejudice and then pivot to arbitration after an adverse ruling.

State–federal division of labor: Even where contracts choose state law, the FAA’s procedural “default” rule controls federal court enforcement. State law may still supply independent grounds for a substantive contract waiver, but it cannot dilute § 3’s default standard.

Employee–employer disputes: Plaintiffs gain protection against “wait-and-see” arbitration tactics; employers must audit and assert arbitration rights at the outset or risk losing them.

Circuit alignment: The Sixth Circuit’s approach aligns with other circuits rejecting strategic “heads I win, tails you arbitrate” behavior, enhancing national uniformity.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Default (FAA § 3): A statutory limit. If a party behaves inconsistently with arbitration—e.g., tries to win a merits dismissal in court before invoking arbitration—it is in “default” and cannot obtain a stay or an order compelling arbitration.

Waiver vs. forfeiture:

Waiver typically means an intentional giving up of a known right (often governed by the substantive law creating the right, like state contract law for arbitration clauses).

Forfeiture is a failure to assert a right in a timely way (often governed by procedural rules). The majority avoids choosing labels; the concurrences explore the taxonomy.

Practical point: Labels aside, under the FAA’s “default,” intent is not required; inconsistent litigation conduct can be enough.

With prejudice vs. without prejudice:

A dismissal with prejudice is a merits judgment that ends the dispute and forecloses arbitration.

A dismissal without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction is not a merits decision and may be compatible with preserving arbitration rights.

Sections 3 and 4 work together:

§ 3: Stay of litigation pending arbitration—available only if the movant is not in “default.”

§ 4: Order compelling arbitration—subject to the same “default” limitation.

Morgan v. Sundance effect: Courts cannot add arbitration-specific hurdles (like prejudice). Arbitration agreements are treated like any other contract in assessing abandonment of rights.

State arbitration law vs. FAA:

State law can set substantive contract rules (e.g., what counts as a waiver under state contract law).

The FAA supplies the federal procedural conditions for federal relief (stay/compel), including the “default” bar.

Additional Observations and Practice Pointers

Preserve arbitration early: Assert the arbitration clause in the first responsive filing and move promptly under § 3 (and/or § 4). Request a stay explicitly to trigger Spizzirri’s mandatory-stay rule.

Avoid merits-first strategy: Do not file Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss with prejudice while holding arbitration in reserve. That is the conduct this opinion condemns as “default.”

Jurisdictional motions are different: Motions that do not seek a merits resolution (e.g., lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction) are less likely to be inconsistent with arbitration.

Mixed claims? Proceed carefully: Where some claims are concededly non-arbitrable, limited merits motions may be compatible with preserving arbitration on others; clarity and early invocation remain critical.

Don’t rely on “we didn’t know”: The Sixth Circuit is skeptical that ignorance excuses delay—especially where the movant drafted the agreement.

Procedural form matters: File the right motion. A “summary judgment to compel arbitration” is a category error. Use § 3 (stay) and/or § 4 (compel). Apply summary-judgment standards only to resolve formation/scope fact disputes, not to obtain a merits judgment.

What the Decision Does Not Decide

The underlying merits of Kloosterman’s First Amendment and Title VII claims were not before the court; the appeal solely concerned arbitrability and timing.

Whether, as a matter of state contract law, defendants also waived arbitration was unnecessary to resolve; the court found federal FAA “default” sufficient to reverse.

Whether a genuine lack of knowledge of an arbitration clause might ever excuse delay (the court noted no such claim here and has been skeptical of “mistake” arguments).

Concurrences: Refining the Waiver–Forfeiture Landscape

Judge Murphy (concurring):

Proposes a clarifying framework: parties may both waive their substantive right to arbitrate under state contract law and forfeit that right under the FAA’s federal procedural “default” rule.

Suggests our past “waiver” cases are better read as applying a federal forfeiture rule grounded in § 3’s “default.”

Judge Bloomekatz (concurring):

Warns that waiver/forfeiture distinctions are context-dependent and not always cleanly separable; procedural rules sometimes define waiver, and some doctrines resist forfeiture.

Endorses resolving FAA cases by focusing on the statute’s text—“default”—rather than choosing between waiver or forfeiture labels.

Conclusion

The Sixth Circuit’s opinion establishes a crisp, predictable rule: a defendant who first pursues a merits win in court and only then invokes arbitration has defaulted under the FAA and cannot compel or stay litigation in favor of arbitration. The decision integrates Morgan v. Sundance by excising any prejudice requirement, aligns Sections 3 and 4 under a single “default” standard, and respects Erie principles by reserving substantive contract waiver to state law while enforcing federal procedural “default” in federal court.

Practically, the case will force parties to put their arbitration cards on the table at the outset. It inhibits strategic, “wait-and-see” tactics and promotes the FAA’s core policy of enforcing arbitration agreements as written—without elevating arbitration above other contracts. For counsel, the message is straightforward: if you truly want arbitration, act like it from day one.

Key Takeaways

Merits motions before arbitration = FAA “default.”

No prejudice showing required post–Morgan.

“Default” bars relief under both FAA §§ 3 and 4.

Request a stay explicitly; do not move for “summary judgment to compel.”

Jurisdictional motions may be compatible; merits dismissals with prejudice are not.

CNN reports that the U.S. administration plans to return hundreds of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala who arrived in the United States, in coordination with the government of Guatemala.

Early Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the removal of Guatemalan minors who are in the United States under guardianship, but according to an immigration attorney representing the children removed from custody after the court ruling, the plans remained in effect.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) said that Guatemala “requested the return of certain unaccompanied foreign minors who are in federal custody for the purpose of reunification with their respective family members,” according to CNN.

Children of various ages are told that in the United States there may not be one of their parents, though there may be a relative, and they have a father or legal guardian in Guatemala. The criteria also include children who have no asylum cases and should not be victims of trafficking after return, according to the report.

But lawyers representing some of the children say that those identified are at risk if they are returned to Guatemala, and are in prolonged immigration proceedings.

In a lawsuit filed earlier on Sunday in the District Court for the District of Columbia, ten Guatemalan minors aged 10 to 17 were identified for removal; the majority of them are in immigration proceedings.

One of the children, a 10-year-old indigenous girl, suffered abuse and neglect at the hands of other guardians in Guatemala. Her mother died.

Judge Sparkle L. Sukkananan ordered the U.S. government not to remove any of the plaintiffs for two weeks and scheduled a hearing for Sunday afternoon.

An immigration attorney representing several Guatemalan children told CNN that the children were “scared and bewildered” by what is happening.

Reaction to the explanation of what is happening is disbelief. They are very frightened. All say they fear returning to Guatemala for various reasons. They were literally woken from their beds in the middle of the night, on holiday weekends.

Additional Details of the Process and Readiness to Travel

On Saturday night, ORR also informed shelters caring for unaccompanied migrant minors that the children had been identified “for reunification with their parents and/or legal guardians” in their country of origin, and they should be ready for discharge within two hours, or four hours if the child is in a family‑care program, after receiving the notice.

Children must be ready for the trip, including having the proper documents, medications, personal belongings, and two pre-packed lunch packs.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia are ten Guatemalan minors aged 10 to 17 who were identified for removal; most of them are in immigration proceedings.

The two men, who were government contractors working at the fire, were detained after federal agents flagged them while verifying the identities of the members of the wildland firefighter crew. DHS alleges that both men were in the country illegally and that one had a prior order of removal.

U.S Representative Emily Randall, of Washington's Sixth District, stated that on Saturday, during an unannounced visit to the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, she was denied entry, despite having legal protections to do so.

“I cited the statute multiple times to make sure that they understood they were breaking the law, and they said, 'Well, your previous visits have not been on a weekend.'”

Randall says she had been to the NWIPC three times in 2025, with two of those visits being pre-planned and one of them being unannounced. Each of those times, she was allowed entry.

The statute she is referencing is . It reads in part:

""SEC. 527. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Homeland Security by this Act may be used to prevent any of the following persons from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens...""

In addition to:

""(b) Nothing in this section may be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility described in subsection (a) for the purpose of conducting oversight.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded with the following statement, in regards to our questions about why Rep. Randall was not allowed entry on Saturday:

“Here are the facts. As ICE law enforcement have seen a surge in assaults, disruptions, and obstructions to enforcement — including by Members of Congress themselves — any requests to tour processing centers and field offices must be approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security. These requests must be part of legitimate congressional oversight activities. ICE officers have seen an 830% surge in assaults.

“As for visits to detention facilities, requests should be made with sufficient time to prevent interference with the President’s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions—a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority. To protect the President’s Article II authority, any request to shorten that time must be approved by the Secretary.”

Despite not gaining entry, Randall still wanted to make her position known about what she believed was wrongful detention.

""To arrest individuals and waylay folks for 3 hours or more, who are involved in fuel management, involved in the great machine of fighting this wildland fire, is disgusting.”

In an on Friday, DHS claimed that the two men ""were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; [but rather] they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood.""

Randall pushed back on this notion, saying that having been to the wildfire zone herself, she knows how important the mitigation of fuels is towards the containment effort.

""It's a lot of fuel management, a lot of trying to keep the wood from becoming fire fuel, and it takes a lot of bodies to do that work,"" said Randall.

In the meantime, Randall says many questions remain from her and her congressional colleagues about DHS, U.S Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Bureau of Land Management, about their operation, particularly due to a 2021 DHS policy, which restricted immigration enforcement within disaster response zones.

“We have asked Secretary Noem if they have made any policy changes related to that.""

It's one of numerous answers that Randall and others are looking for from those three agencies, prompting her and dozens more to draft a congressional letter to the heads of those three agencies on Friday.

KOMO News is still waiting for a response from DHS on the 2021 policy and where that stands in the administration's current immigration enforcement landscape.

But while there were some tense moments, there were only a few arrests for the day.

Three people were arrested in Adelaide:

A 23-year-old man was arrested for assaulting police

Two 32-year-old men were arrested for “wearing articles of disguise” and failing to state personal details

A woman was arrested in Sydney for breaching the peace.

We also know at least one person was arrested in Melbourne's CBD.

SA premier says state 'celebrates' multiculturalism

S

By Stacey Pestrin

When asked about the march at an unrelated press conference earlier this morning, South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said he believed it represented a “minority view .. that don’t represent what the overall majority of South Australians believe and know”:

“2.4 per cent of the South Australian population is Indigenous.

""That means that 97.6 per cent of South Australians have an immigrant heritage.

""I’m proud of mine, and I think most South Australians are proud of theirs.

“Let me make this perfectly clear – the overwhelmingly majority of South Australians don’t just tolerate diversity and multiculturalism, we celebrate it.

“It’s part of who we are.

""It is not just something that is part of our social fabric, it is the very essence of our social fabric.”

South Australia's state opposition leader Vincent Tarzia was also asked about the rally at a separate unrelated press conference.

He said Australia had been “a great country of abundance for migrants like my family and other families that come here”:

""I absolutely don’t want to see any acts of violence today.

""I think people need to pull their head in and remember that there is much more, much more, that unites us than divides us.""

Kimberley Benjamin said the March for Australia rallies did not represent the town's values:

""Regardless of what was happening on the other side of the road, we were always going to turn up to make a stand for our community and what was happening in the big cities,"" she said.

""We've had lots of toots, lots of encouragement from the cars going past. Had a few people shout some things at us but that doesn't deter from what we're here to stand up for.""

Cheryl Mascall said despite the cancelled March for Australia event, she turned out to ""support love for the country and the flag"".

""Smaller turn out which is sad because I thought there'd be a lot more patriots.

""We're not racists or anything like that.

""All we are is Australians who are proud to be Australian.

""The way we're struggling with housing, the way we're struggling with hospital beds and everything else.

Police say 15,000 people protested in Adelaide

S

By Stacey Pestrin

Police estimate that 15,000 people took part in today’s demonstrations in Adelaide, which included the March for Australia rally and a counter-rally.

SA Police said in a statement that the crowds were “generally well-behaved”, but three people were arrested including a 23-year-old man for assaulting police and two 32-year-old men for “wearing articles of disguise” and failing to state personal details.

The Adelaide “March for Australia” rally included a march from Rundle Park to Parliament House then onto Peace Park in North Adelaide, where it ended following an altercation between protestors.

The altercation broke out after a member of the National Socialist Network took to the stage to call for an end to immigration.

Organisers attempted to take the megaphone, claiming the comments were racist, and a scuffle broke out before police stepped in.

Organisers told the ABC the National Socialist Network had not been invited to speak at the event.

Australia's peak community services body, the Australian Council of Social Service, has released a statement condemning racism, hate and discrimination, in light of the anti-immigration rallies that took place across Australia today.

""ACOSS respects the right to peaceful assembly but we reject in strongest terms all forms of racism, fascism, hate speech and bigotry,"" CEO Cassandra Goldie said.

""Australia's diversity is a great strength, not a threat, and today's rallies should not be a platform to divide communities or spread misinformation about migration and its impacts.

""There is no place in Australia for ideology that targets people because of who they are, where they come from or what they believe.

""Our priority is the safety and wellbeing of all people who feel intimidated, harmed or targeted by today's events. ACOSS extends our love and solidarity to all affected.""

In Western Australia's far north, counter-protesters outnumbered March for Australia attendees in Broome, after local organisers ""cancelled"" the planned event.

Around 40 community members converged on the roadside, waving flags and cheering at cars passing by in a bid to counter the planned rally.

Meanwhile, seven people turned up at nearby Beford Park, waving Australian flags.

The events were held during a time when thousands of tourists flock to Broome for the two-week Shinju Matsuri festival, which celebrates the town's multicultural history and diverse communities.

Things came to a head on Bourke Street, usually crowded with weekend shoppers visiting brand-name stores.

Instead, protesters and counter-protesters had a standoff, separated by dozens of police.

At least one person was arrested by police, as arguments descended into isolated skirmishes and brawls on the city streets.

Mounted police were deployed to break up throngs of protesters on both sides.

Arguments broke out between groups on street corners and intersections, with police quick to separate groups.

Speaking in Canberra to March for Australia group, Senator Hanson said:

“I just want to say how proud I am to see so many Australians that are standing here today

""It takes me back to 30 years ago – 1996 – when I wore this flag.

“They tried to denigrate and have a go at me for being a proud Australian…to stand up for our Australian values and morals and who we are as a nation of people.”

A woman who attended Canberra’s march told the ABC:

""I'm in my 70s, and I cannot believe the way that laws are being passed in Australia .”

""I love Australia, and I just think Albanese has sold us out.

""We are no longer a free country, we’re becoming a socialist, communist country

""We’re pleading with the people of Australia to rise up…peacefully.""

A rally in Geraldton, WA's second-largest regional city, drew a crowd of around 100 people.

In addition to chants of ""Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi"", speakers repeatedly referenced local police-officer-turned-sovereign-citizen Wayne Glew, who has had repeated run-ins with the City of Greater Geraldton and the WA government.

Other topics canvassed included the region's ongoing lack of housing, with speakers highlighting how supply was failing to meet increasing demand.
