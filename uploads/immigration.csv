In the Memphis immigration court, Romo’s experience was different.
Religious and advocacy groups have successfully set up immigration court watch programs in other cities, including Chicago Courtwatch and the Human Rights Defender Project in Minnesota.
Court watch programs also reach beyond immigration court across the United States.","As federal prosecutors push harder for swift deportations and accounts of immigration officers arresting people at court hearings circulate, a Memphis-based legal nonprofit and clergy members are working together to ensure these events don’t go unwitnessed.

Advocates for Immigrant Rights (AIR) is in the early stages of building what the law firm hopes will become a robust immigration court watch program run with clergy volunteers, Executive Director Casey Bryant said.

The firm provides affordable legal help and support services to immigrants, serving people in Tennessee, North Mississippi, Arkansas and sometimes Kentucky — all areas handled by the Memphis immigration court. There are 126,623 pending immigration cases in the Memphis court as of July 31, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a University of Syracuse organization that gathers federal data.

This spring, immigration attorneys began to take note of a new legal tactic across the country. When immigrants who have been released at the border show up for their assigned court dates, prosecutors are pushing for their cases to be dismissed, leaving them without the protection of the court process. When they leave, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are waiting to arrest them and sometimes quickly deport them in a process called expedited removal, Bryant said.

A Department of Homeland Security notice issued in January walked back Biden-era limits on expedited removal in an effort to “apply expedited removal to the fullest extent authorized by Congress.” In July, advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of 12 immigrants from several countries who were arrested after their first court hearing and face expedited removal orders.

Tennessee faith leaders criticize ICE anti-immigrant action, “harassment” of Nashville mayor

“Secretary (Kristi) Noem is reversing Biden’s catch-and-release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in a May statement to CBS News regarding the administration’s shift in policy.

Bryant said the tactic “blindsided” court advocates. Most immigrants do not have legal representation, meaning “a ton of people were just getting whisked away from immigration courts with no witness except for the staff of the court,” Bryant said.

That’s where Catholic priest Juan Antonio “Tony” Romo comes in. Members of his majority-Hispanic congregation at his Memphis church have been arrested and deported, and the church community is afraid, he said. Romo saw a news story about a bishop in San Diego who attended immigration court hearings and felt compelled to act.

Romo and Monsignor Valentine Handwerker — a retired Memphis priest who spent nearly 50 years in ministry and remains concerned with social justice issues — reached out to ask Bryant to attend hearings with them and explain what they were seeing.

Inside immigration court

Romo recalled an immigration immersion trip he made with other clergy members and nuns in southern Arizona a few years ago. They traced immigrants’ paths through the desert and attended a court hearing. Romo said immigrants were led in wearing jail uniforms and chains, with no representation.

“The judge would just say, boom … you are deported, boom, you are deported,” he said. “It was a pretty disgusting experience of the way the people were mistreated.”

Romo said he cares about social issues — issues “faced by the people of God beyond the spiritual.”

“I’m a missionary,” he said. “I don’t call myself an immigrant, but in some ways, I am. I came to the U.S., not in the way of making a better life, but in a way to minister, to serve the people of God. But to the (Trump) administration and for most people, I’m an immigrant.”

Romo was born in Mexico and moved to the United States after completing two years of law school to join the Society of the Divine Word, a Catholic clerical congregation. He completed his undergraduate and masters degrees in Iowa and Illinois, and spent two years training as a missionary in Portugal. Romo has lived in California, Florida and Washington, D.C., according to the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, where he has served as pastor since 2012.

In the Memphis immigration court, Romo’s experience was different. None of the immigrants he saw had legal representation, he said, but translators were available and Romo described one judge as calm and caring.

“As we engaged in conversation with (the judge), he told us about people who are already frightened when they come to court,” Romo said. “And he said, ‘Why make it worse?’”

Romo did not see any arrests or ICE presence during his first two visits.

“Everyone got another day in court,” he said. “Their judges asked them for more documents and to edit their application for asylum.”

When Romo first walked into the building, he saw three people there to appear in court. He introduced himself and Handwerker as priests who “decided to just come and be present for people” and asked if they would like the priests to attend their hearings.

“The smiles on their faces — it was like, yes, Father, please,” he said.

Later, they thanked the priests as they left.

“That told us how people feel when they see their priest is standing up with them,” Romo said. “Just being there. Even if you cannot do anything, even if you cannot say anything, just being there means a lot to them.”

Bryant envisions a program where there is always someone in each courtroom bearing witness to the court proceedings and decisions made.

“It’s also about people seeing friendly faces” in a “process that is so dehumanizing,” Bryant said.

Next steps

The next steps to build a formal court watch program include recruiting more court watchers and obtaining buy-in from the court’s administration, Bryant said.

AIR partners with multiple organizations, including Catholic Charities of East and West Tennessee, and Bryant said the nonprofit is also working with the Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, a group that has connections with clergy from different denominations.

Ultimately, AIR will develop training for volunteers to familiarize them with court decorum and protocol.

Getting the court to recognize the program is the next key step, Bryant said. While immigration court hearings are generally open to the public for observation, Bryant said the court’s formal blessing would “ensure volunteer observers could get into the courts without hassle.” It could also help with scheduling volunteers if the program gets advance notice on which judges have hearings on which days.

Bryant said the Memphis court directed AIR to contact court administration on the national level. Bryant is awaiting their response.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which administers the immigration court system, doesn’t have a formal pathway to set up a court watch system, but it does offer a Model Hearing Program that explains the court’s procedures and offers opportunities to observe live model hearings with a review of relevant law.

Religious and advocacy groups have successfully set up immigration court watch programs in other cities, including Chicago Courtwatch and the Human Rights Defender Project in Minnesota. Depending on the program, volunteers are sometimes asked to collect data and observations on court proceedings.

Court watch programs also reach beyond immigration court across the United States. The programs “ensure scrutiny and evaluation,” according to the American Bar Association (ABA). “They serve to highlight the realities of our legal system by recording data, uncovering stories, identifying trends, and highlighting problems” that can potentially drive reform, ABA states.

In the meantime, Romo has told his parishioners that he will do his best to attend immigration hearings for anyone who wants him to be there.

Bryant said court watching is also an opportunity for people to see the system in action, and perhaps challenge misconceptions.

“I really think that bringing people to court, even if it’s just one time, will open their eyes to the way that people are being treated in this country, and it will change their mind,” Bryant said. “If they think one way, I think they’re going to see it’s something totally different.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gavel.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 06:56:30.407987

Again, roughly two-thirds of the aliens removed by ICE after ICE detention under Trump II had criminal histories.","A recent Newsweek article claiming that 70 percent of the aliens detained by ICE don’t have convictions prompted me to examine ICE arrest, detention, and removal figures under Biden and Trump II. I was surprised to find that fewer than half of the aliens ICE arrested in the interior under the last administration had convictions or pending criminal charges, while roughly two-thirds of the aliens (1) arrested by ICE and currently detained by the agency; and (2) detained and removed by ICE under Trump II have criminal histories. Facts don’t lie, but sometimes you need help to understand what they are saying.

“ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics”

As an aid to pundits, reporters, and the public at large, ICE publishes a dashboard, “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics”, that details the agency’s arrests, detentions, expulsions, and removals.

Those statistics only begin, however, in October 2020 (the month before that year’s presidential election) and end in December 2024 (the month after the last presidential election). In other words, it essentially only covers the last administration.

ICE Arrests under the Biden Administration

According to that dashboard, between February 2021 (the first full month of the Biden administration) and December 2024 (the last full month), ICE arrested just over a half-million (500,842) aliens in the United States, in what are known as “interior arrests”.

Those weren’t migrants who came illegally who were apprehended by Border Patrol or stopped at the ports of entry by CBP officers — those were aliens already here arrested by ICE.

Of those half-million-plus aliens, just over 181,000 were convicted criminals (36.2 percent), a little more than 64,000 had pending criminal charges (12.8 percent), and the other roughly 51 percent — 255,585 aliens — were “other immigration violators”, aliens with final orders of removal or pending immigration charges.

ICE Detentions Under the Biden Administration

By contrast, ICE detained just over 1.107 million aliens under the last administration, through the end of December.

That seems like a fairly large number until you consider that Border Patrol alone apprehended more than 1.53 million aliens at the Southwest border (alone) in FY 2024 (alone), the vast majority of whom ICE is mandated by law to detain.

Of those 1.107 million ICE detentions, just 283,472 involved aliens who weren’t initially arrested by CBP at the borders and ports, but rather were the product of interior arrests.

Some 177,344 of those ICE detentions after interior arrests involved convicted criminals (62.6 percent) and just fewer than 58,200 of them had pending criminal charges (20.5 percent). The rest, nearly 48,000 in total, were “other immigration violators” (16.9 percent, more than half detained in New York City).

In other words, while just over half of the aliens ICE arrested in the interior between February 2021 and December 2024 had no criminal records (aside from illegal entry or reentry), very few of them were subsequently detained — which raises the question of why ICE bothered to arrest them.

ICE Removals Under Biden

Which leads me to the third major metric on that dashboard, ICE removals from the United States.

In that 47-month period, ICE removed almost 588,500 aliens from the United States, but only 147,533 of those aliens were “interior removals” — deportations of aliens living in the United States.

The remainder — nearly 441,000 aliens in total — were aliens first encountered by CBP at the borders and the ports and handed over to ICE for removal, a longstanding scheme to pump up removals my colleague Jessica Vaughan has referred to as “cooking the books”.

Of those interior removals, just fewer than 115,600 had criminal convictions (78.4 percent), 23,111 had pending charges (15.7 percent), and the rest, just 8,825 in total, were removed on immigration grounds alone.

Contrast those figures with court-ordered removals under Biden.

According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), in FY 2024 immigration judges ordered nearly 310,000 alien respondents removed from the United States, on top of more than 231,000 removal orders in FY 2023 (DOJ’s FY 2022 statistics are unavailable). Most never were forced to leave.

Better yet, compare them with the 1.44 million aliens on ICE’s non-detained docket as of late November who had final removal orders and yet remained in the United States. Do the math and see that ICE under Biden removed just a fraction of the aliens it could and should have.

Politicians love to throw around the term “due process” in the immigration context, but that process is little more than kabuki theater if after aliens receive the process they’re due in immigration court, they aren’t removed from the country — but that’s what happened under the last administration.

ICE Detentions and Removals in FY 2025

As noted, the period covered by that ICE dashboard ends in December 2024, but other ICE statistics can fill in some of the gaps.

An ICE Detention Management web page links to a series of Excel spreadsheets, “Detention Statistics”, which cover the agency’s detentions and removals in the current fiscal year.

As of late August, ICE was detaining 61,226 aliens, 76 percent of whom were ICE arrestees (again, interior arrests) and 24 percent of whom came to the agency through CBP encounters.

Of the 46,595 aliens currently in ICE detention who were the product of interior arrests, 16,619 have criminal convictions (35.7 percent), 14,212 have pending criminal charges (30.5 percent), and 15,764 are “other immigration violators” (33.8 percent).

Roughly two-thirds of the aliens arrested by ICE and currently detained have criminal histories, and a similar percentage of the aliens the agency has deported from its custody under Trump II, do too.

In other words, nearly two-thirds of the aliens first arrested by ICE and detained by that agency had a criminal history. Even though it may be comparing tangerines and oranges, that’s a larger percentage than the less than half of ICE interior arrests under Biden involving aliens with criminal histories.

That spreadsheet also shows that in FY 2025, 191,393 aliens were released from ICE detention for removal, and that just less than 141,000 of those aliens were removed after February 2025, the first full month of the Trump administration.

Keep in mind that those statistics are not broken down by initial arresting agency. But given that the number of illegal border-crossers has plummeted since Trump’s return, it’s safe to assume that most of those removals came after ICE interior arrests.

That’s particularly likely given that, of those Trump-era ICE removals of aliens from its custody, 41.4 percent (58,430) had criminal convictions, 25 percent had pending criminal charges (35,299), and 33.5 percent (47,195) were “other immigration violators”.

Again, roughly two-thirds of the aliens removed by ICE after ICE detention under Trump II had criminal histories.

Those aren’t all the aliens removed under Trump, either, as others received removal orders while in criminal proceedings and were simply transported out for removal.

During a recent trip to south Texas, I saw some of those deportations in action, when I came upon a group of aliens just released from criminal custody being dropped off by ICE at the Del Rio port of entry to walk across the bridge to Ciudad Acuña, Mexico.

Fortunately, my Spanish is not very good, because some of them were neither happy to see me nor to have to leave.

“Trump Admin Says 70% of ICE Detainees Do Not Have Criminal Convictions”

Which brings me to an August 29, 2025, Newsweek article headlined, “Trump Admin Says 70% of ICE Detainees Do Not Have Criminal Convictions”.

That article relied on the same Detention Management web page I cited above, as is clear from the second paragraph: “The latest detention management stats from ICE showed a record 61,226 people were being held in ICE facilities across the country as of August 29.”

Of course, to get to the 70 percent figure in the headline, you must add illegal entrants first encountered by CBP — not arrested by ICE in the interior — into the ICE detention total.

Respectfully, it’s not ICE’s fault that more criminals aren’t coming here illegally (not that anyone, save a select few, wants that), or that Congress requires the agency to detain those migrants regardless of whether they are criminals or not.

That article does include the following caveat: “As of Friday, out of the 61,226 detainees, 18,205 were convicted criminals, 15,593 had pending criminal charges, and 27,428 were being held on other immigration violations, reflecting normal trends for ICE detention.” (Emphasis added.)

That, of course, raises the question of how the author defines “normal trends for ICE detention”, but in that vein, I’d argue that the Biden administration was the outlier in not detaining more “other immigration violators” ICE had already arrested than the Trump administration was for keeping them in custody.

And I should know, having been an INS prosecutor under President Clinton and an immigration judge in a detained court under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.

“Immigrants Residing in the Country ... Legally, with Valid Documentation ... Detained”

But I digress. Note the aforementioned caveat appeared in the eighth paragraph of that article, whereas this is from paragraph five, under the subheading “Why It Matters”:

Immigrants residing in the country illegally and legally, with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, as well as those with criminal histories, have been detained. Many with past convictions, even from decades ago, have found themselves in ICE custody despite spending years without facing serious immigration problems.

That sounds unkind unless you click on the link for the “valid documentation” part, which sends you to a separate May 21 Newsweek article, “Green Card Holder Detained by ICE at Immigration Appointment, Wife Says”.

It tells the story of a Danish national arrested by ICE when he went to a naturalization appointment, over what his wife described as “a paperwork miscommunication from 2015”.

The next paragraph, however, explains that according to DHS, the “green card holder” in question was ordered deported in April 2019. With all due respect, if that’s a “paperwork miscommunication”, I handed out thousands of them in my eight years on the bench.

The link for “many with past convictions”, on the other hand, takes you to an August Newsweek article about “a refugee who arrived from Vietnam over 40 years ago and obtained a lawful permanent resident status, or green card, soon after”. He was recently detained at an ICE call-in.

Had his story ended there, he’d have been fine, except that he was convicted of robbery eight years after he came here and thereafter “violated probation after a subsequent burglary charge”.

Granted, his criminal history ended in the past, but there’s no statute of limitations on either removal orders or on the criminal convictions that render aliens removable. Congress could always add such limitations to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), but ICE is bound by the law now.

The Laken Riley Act

And if anything, ICE is even more bound by the law today. Let me explain.

The reason why ICE agents and officers failed to arrest, detain, and remove more aliens — criminals and “other immigration violators” alike — over the past four years is because the Biden administration, and then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to be specific, wouldn’t let them.

In September 2021, Mayorkas issued “guidelines” that tightly restricted such ICE “enforcement actions” by requiring the agency to consider various “aggravating” and “mitigating” factors before it could even investigate facially removable aliens, including criminals.

The problem is: (1) those factors don’t appear in the INA; but (2) the INA does require ICE to arrest and detain most of those criminals. Nonetheless, when Texas and other states sued the administration to force it to comply with the statutory detention mandates, Biden’s DOJ fought all the way to the Supreme Court to keep the Mayorkas guidelines in place.

“Successfully fought”, I might add, as the High Court concluded the states lacked standing.

To reassert its authority over immigration enforcement and protect states from criminals, the first bill Congress passed in its latest session was S.5, the “Laken Riley Act”, named after a Georgia student slain by an illegal migrant released under Biden.

That law grants state attorneys general standing in federal court to challenge DHS non-detention decisions, including when ICE fails to detain aliens subject to detention on criminal grounds and CBP releases aliens at the borders and ports on “parole”.

The act actually goes one step further by also requiring ICE to also arrest and detain aliens with pending criminal charges for “burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or assault of a law enforcement officer offense, or any crime that results in death or serious bodily injury to another person”.

“Egregious Crimes”

One last point raised in the latest Newsweek article is that there’s no way to tell whether the criminal aliens ICE is arresting and detaining have been charged with or convicted of so-called “egregious crimes”.

Respectfully (once more), whether a crime is “egregious” or not is wholly subjective (ask any victim), but also irrelevant.

Congress decides what crimes subject aliens to mandatory detention and removal, but drunk driving (which isn’t a removable offense) is likely a more serious danger to the community than tax evasion (which is, and an aggravated felony when you cheat the government out of more than $10,000).

Statistics don’t lie, but they often need analysis. Here’s the key takeaway: Roughly two-thirds of the aliens arrested by ICE and currently detained have criminal histories, and a similar percentage of the aliens the agency has deported from its custody under Trump II, do too.

Vasquez noted the agricultural industry, especially in the U.S. West, “has involved immigrant labor for many, many decades,” and he warned of the potential consequences on the U.S. economy of proceeding with mass deportations.

“As we see these mass deportation rates, which are very draconian, and we know that the housekeepers and the restaurant workers and the construction workers who may not be here with the right documentation. Well, let’s give them the right documentation,” he said.

“Let’s vet them. Let’s put them through a process which allows our economy to have the global competitiveness that we need, and at the same time, make sure that we have our border in order, which we can do,” he continued.

When asked about plans to turn disused military sites into asylum processing centres, Healey told Sky News: “I have been putting military planners into their Border Command and into their planning for the future.","Ministers are considering ways to “tighten” the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to enhance their ability to deport those with no right to remain in the UK. Defence Secretary John Healey made the admission this morning as he confirmed that the Government was “looking” at how they could narrow the interpretation of the convention, particularly in regards to the article protecting the right to a family life.

The article has been used to justify several controversial decisions in recent months that have allowed asylum seekers to remain in the UK. Healey was speaking after a monumental day in Westminster on Friday, which saw the departure of Angela Rayner, followed by the removal of Yvette Cooper as Home Secretary in favour of Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood. Asked about the Government’s approach to the ECHR, the Defence Secretary told Sky News: “We are looking at how we can tighten the interpretation and the application of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly in areas like the right to family life and family joining.”

The removal of Cooper could be the catalyst for a change in approach to the migrant crisis, as record numbers of people continue to make their way across the English Channel and protests continue outside hotels housing asylum seekers.

An anonymous source told the Sunday Times that Ms Mahmood’s approach to the ECHR was that “nothing is off the table”, and that she would likely want reform of the convention.

The source went on to claim that Mahmood, who took the decision to release prisoners early into her tenure as Justice Secretary to prevent prisons from overflowing, will take a radical approach to the issue and the ECHR.

They added that she would “start with the unthinkable and work backwards”.

One such measure could include the use of disused military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels, a practise that costs the taxpayer £5.77 million per day on average.

When asked about plans to turn disused military sites into asylum processing centres, Healey told Sky News: “I have been putting military planners into their Border Command and into their planning for the future.

“We are looking at the potential use of military and non-military use sites for temporary accommodation for the people who come across on these small boats that may not have a right to be here or need to be processed rapidly before we can decide whether or not they should stay or whether or not we deport them, like we have done in record numbers over the last year.”",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/1200x630/6411303.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:59.089158

Ald. Jeylú Gutiérrez (14th) confirmed to the Sun-Times that three people were arrested Sunday in her ward, which includes parts of Archer Heights, Gage Park and Chicago Lawn.

One of the arrests was caught on video, which shows federal agents holding a flower vendor’s hands behind his back. Another video appears to show ICE agents speaking with the vendor.

“It’s really difficult,” Gutiérrez said. “I’m an immigrant myself, I’m a mom. To think about how those people are not coming back home to their family tonight just breaks my heart.”

Gutiérrez warned her constituents that ICE isn’t only after people in the U.S. without permission.

“I just want it to be clear that this is an attack on our hardworking people and our community as a whole,” she said. “It’s not just those who are undocumented, it’s racial profiling.”

On Sunday, President Donald Trump walked back his war threat on Chicago, NPR reported. “We’re not going to war. We’re going to clean up our cities,” Trump told reporters on Sunday as he left the White House, according to NPR. “We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend. That’s not war, that’s common sense.”

Federal agents, including at least some from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, are stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes, the Sun-Times reported. Last week, they were practicing crowd control tactics and prepping for patrols in unmarked vehicles. Over the weekend, Chicago residents and officials alike braced for the National Guard and ICE to descend upon the city en masse.

Homan confirms action in sanctuary cities

Sunday’s arrests came after yet another Trump administration official said Chicagoans should “expect action” this week as the feds get ready to conduct what could be a large-scale anti-immigration effort.

In an appearance on CNN Sunday, border czar Tom Homan was asked by Jake Tapper whether “we should expect action in Chicago this week?”

“Absolutely, you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country,” Homan said. “We got to send additional resources to the problem areas, which are sanctuary cities.”

Homan, however, offered few specifics as to when or where the activity would take place, or whether it would involve National Guard troops as the administration has stated.

Call to action on West Side

Later Sunday, a group of elected officials and community organizers joined a chorus pushing back against Trump’s plans, and especially troops.

In a news conference at the office of Ald. Emma Mitts (37th) in Austin, U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Chicago) stopped short of rejecting any federal assistance. He said the city wanted federal help, but not in the form of immigration enforcement or the National Guard.

Instead, Davis called for the restoration of federal funding for programs like violence interrupters that are credited with Chicago’s 60-year-low summer homicide count and declining crime rates.

“We need all the help we can get from the federal government, but we don’t need another level of law enforcement to pretend they’re going to solve some problem related to violence and crime,” Davis said. “Our authorities are doing well.“

He also warned fellow Chicagoans against ignoring what is happening because they aren’t directly affected.

“The immigration issue doesn’t only relate to people from South and Central America,” Davis said. “So don’t be fooled and don’t think you’re just talking about someone else.”

Tonya Woods, executive director of the West Side Justice Center, said her group has joined with more than 44 community organizations working together to educate people on their rights and keep watch against ICE.

Woods urged people to know their rights and “your resources and your risk” when interacting with law enforcement of any kind.

“This doesn’t mean there might not be misconduct or untoward behavior, because we know we’ve often been the subject of that kind of behavior,” Woods said. “But if more of us know what our rights are and invoke those rights, we can keep us safe.”

Downers Grove protest

On Sunday afternoon, protesters gathered outside the Hampton Inn & Suites in Downers Grove to express their views on possible Trump administration enforcement action.

After the protest, a Sun-Times reporter on the scene saw at least two Department of Homeland Security agents in uniform get out of vehicles bearing DHS markings and logos and enter the hotel. There were at least four marked DHS vehicles in the lot.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dfc5581/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6653x3798+0+320/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F05%2F89%2F843ce0b44dd699d96e29a2b7bca7%2Fchicagoice-090825-006.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 00:57:04.873341

Homan made an appearance Sunday on CNN in an interview with Jake Tapper, who probed the White House Border Czar over the president’s threats of a military incursion in Chicago. Tapper asked if Chicago can “expect action” from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents this week.

“Absolutely,” Homan said. “You can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country. President Trump’s prioritized sanctuary cities because they knowingly release illegal alien public safety threats to the streets everyday. That’s where the problem is.”

The border czar did not clarify when troops could be sent to Chicago or elsewhere and didn’t specify what the federal government’s action plan entailed. The National Guard could be deployed to assist Immigration Enforcement, but Homan did not specify to what capacity National Guard troops could assist ICE agents aside from explaining that the National Guard cannot make arrests.

When asked about how many National Guard troops could be sent into the city, Homan said that it was “law enforcement sensitive information.”

Trump inflamed his threats of federal deployment to Chicago on Saturday, when he posted to social media an AI-generated image that referenced the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now” and said “Chicago about find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The post coincided with the rebranding of the Defense Department to the Department of War, undertaken without legislative approval.

Homan said that the president’s message wasn’t declaring war on Chicago itself, but declaring war on illegal drug operations and undocumented immigrants within the city that are supposedly abetted by city and state leadership.

“I think his words are being taken out of context,” the Border Czar said. “When I say we’re going to war, we’re going to war with the criminal cartels, we’re going to war with illegal aliens – public safety threats – that rape children, that rape citizens, that commit armed robberies, distribute narcotics and kill Americans. We’re at war with the criminal cartels, and Governor Pritzker protects criminal, illegal alien public safety threats everyday in that state along with Mayor Johnson.”

Trump was asked by reporters at the White House Sunday about the reference to declaring war on Chicago, to which he said “we’re not going to war.”

“We’re going to clean up our cities,” Trump said. “That’s not war. That’s common sense.”

“He’s been a vendor here for quite some time,” Celena Morin said. “You see him consistently, especially on the weekends. [He’s] a very sweet gentleman, never causing problems with anyone, very respectful.”

Activists say at least two other detentions occurred in the area, including one at 47th Street and Archer Avenue. Video shows a man was marched to a vehicle by armed officers.

“We helped build this city through our labor and work. People may be afraid, but also, they’re determined to say, ‘this is our home, this is where we belong. We won’t tolerate our people getting kidnapped,” Corina Pedraza with ICIRR said.

Congressman Jesus ‘Chuy’ Garcia condemned the detainments.

“This is the type of racial, ethnic profiling that is going on, and they are pursuing people who are humble, who may not speak English and aren’t a threat to anyone,” he said. “They didn’t have a court order to pick up someone who sells flowers on a street corner and has been doing it for years.”

These detainments come just one day after thousands of protestors rallied against President Donald Trump’s plans to send federal troops to Chicago for expanded immigration enforcement.

THIS OPERATION UNDERSCORES OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING JOBS FOR GEORGIANS AND AMERICANS, ENSURING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR BUSINESSES THAT COMPLY WITH THE LAW, SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ECONOMY AND PROTECTING WORKERS FROM EXPLOITATION. THE INVESTIGATION RESULTED IN THE ARREST OF 475 INDIVIDUALS AND IS FOCUSED ON ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE LAW AND UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. COMPLEX CASES LIKE THIS REQUIRE STRONG COLLABORATION AND EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS, AND WE EXTEND OUR GRATITUDE TO ICE ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, FBI, DEA, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION, ATF, IRS, U.S. MARSHALS, AND THE GEORGIA STATE PATROL FOR THEIR INVALUABLE SUPPORT. EACH AGENCY CONTRIBUTED SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE THAT WAS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS LENGTHY OPERATION. TOGETHER, WE ARE SENDING A CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL MESSAGE THAT THOSE WHO EXPLOIT OUR WORKFORCE UNDERMINE OUR ECONOMY AND VIOLATE FEDERAL LAWS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I’D LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS WAS NOT A IMMIGRATION OPERATION WHERE AGENTS WENT INTO THE PREMISES, ROUNDED UP FOLKS AND PUT THEM ON BUSSES. THIS HAS BEEN A MULTI-MONTH CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION WHERE WE HAVE DEVELOPED EVIDENCE, CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS, GATHERED DOCUMENTS AND PRESENTED THAT EVIDENCE TO THE COURT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A JUDICIAL SEARCH WARRANT. YESTERDAY WE EXECUTED THAT SEARCH WARRANT AND GATHERED ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT WILL SUPPORT THIS INVESTIGATION. THERE ARE NO CRIMINAL CHARGES BEING ANNOUNCED TODAY, BUT THIS IS AN ONGOING MATTER. WHILE WE WERE ON THE PREMISES. WE DID ENCOUNTER MANY HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS. OF THOSE, AS I’VE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, 475 WERE ILLEGALLY PRESENT IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN VIOLATION OF THEIR PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES, WORKING UNLAWFULLY, WHO HAVE ENTERED THROUGH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MEANS INTO THE UNITED STATES. SOME THAT ILLEGALLY CROSSED THE BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES. SOME THAT CAME IN THROUGH VISA WAIVER AND WERE PROHIBITED FROM WORKING. SOME THAT HAD VISAS AND OVERSTAYED THEIR VISAS. AND EACH INDIVIDUAL WAS QUESTIONED ON THEIR STATUS. THEIR DOCUMENTS WERE CHECKED, THEIR BACKGROUNDS WERE CHECKED, AND ULTIMATELY, THROUGH COORDINATION OF OUR EXPERTS AND ATTORNEYS IN THE BACKGROUND, THOSE THAT WERE FOUND TO BE ILLEGALLY PRESENT WERE THEN DETAINED AND TURNED OVER TO ICE. ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS. CUSTODY. BUT THIS IS ALL IN FURTHERANCE OF THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. WE MADE SEIZURES YESTERDAY AS PART OF THAT TO GATHER ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AND CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS AND ARE CONTINUING THIS ONGOING INVESTIGATION. WE WILL TAKE SOME LIMITED QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. OF THE 475, HOW MANY WERE KOREAN NATIONALS? THE KOREAN MEDIA ARE REPORTING AS MANY AS 300. THERE WAS A MAJORITY OF KOREAN NATIONALS FROM THE 475. I DON’T HAVE THE EXACT NATIONALITY BREAKDOWN FOR YOU, BUT WE CAN LIKELY GET THAT AFTER THE FACT. WERE THESE EMPLOYEES OF HELGA BATTERY? WERE THEY EMPLOYEES OF CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS THAT WERE DOING CONSTRUCTION WORK ON THE SITE? WHO THEY WORK FOR? AS WE HAD DETERMINED THROUGH OUR INVESTIGATION IN ADVANCE AND CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY, THERE WAS A NETWORK OF SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS FOR THE SUBCONTRACTORS THERE. SO THE EMPLOYEES WORKED FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES THAT WERE ON THE SITE. IT WAS NOT JUST THE PARENT COMPANY, BUT ALSO SUBCONTRACTORS. AND WE’RE UNVEILING THAT, THAT WHOLE NETWORK. SOME OF THEM WERE FOR THE PARENT COMPANIES. THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE INVESTIGATION OF, WHO EXACTLY WORKED FOR WHAT COMPANIES? WHERE ARE THESE 475 PEOPLE NOW? THEY ARE IN THE CUSTODY OF ICE ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS. MOST WERE BROUGHT TO THE FOLKSTON. FACILITY LAST NIGHT, AND THEY WILL BE MOVED BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THAT. YES, MA’AM. WTOC HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING ON THE PRESENCE OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ON THE SITE FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW, AND SO THIS IS KIND OF BEEN SOMETHING THAT’S BEEN KNOWN TO SOME EXTENT IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. WHAT IS IT THAT PROMPTED HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS TO LOOK INTO THIS? YEAH, WE ARE AWARE AND WE HAVE MONITORED THAT REPORTING AS WELL. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED MANY LEADS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS, FROM PRIOR WORKERS. WE HAVE CONDUCTED MANY ARRESTS THROUGH THE IMMIGRATION OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF GEORGIA THAT HAVE IDENTIFIED OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT, WHEN ENCOUNTERED, INFORMED US THAT THEY WORKED THERE. WE HAVE INTERVIEWED FOLKS AND WE HAVE DEVELOPED EVIDENCE OVER THE COURSE OF MANY MONTHS IN SUPPORT OF THE INVESTIGATION. WHAT ARE SOME POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES THAT THE COMPANY COULD FACE, OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN SPEAK TO? I DON’T WANT TO SPECULATE ON ULTIMATE. THIS IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION. NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED. SO THAT MEANS THAT NO WRONGDOING IS BEING ACCUSED AT THIS TIME. YES, MA’AM. I HAD A QUESTION. WAS ANYONE INJURED DURING THE PROCESS? DID ANYONE DIE DURING THE PROCESS OF THIS RAID? THERE WERE NO THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL USES OF FORCE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED OTHER THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS OVERHEATING A LITTLE BIT AND WAS TREATED ON SCENE. AND ONE AGENT SUFFERED A MINOR LACERATION WHILE CONDUCTING IT, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT INJURIES. OKAY. AND THEN DURING THE PROCESS, YOU SAID THIS WAS A MULTI-MONTH PROCESS ABOUT CAN YOU KIND OF, I GUESS, GIVE A HOW MANY MONTHS DID IT TAKE, I GUESS IS MY QUESTION. THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR. SO CAN WE SAY JANUARY? I DON’T HAVE THE EXACT START DATE OF THE INVESTIGATION. HOW DOES THIS OPERATION COMPARE TO OTHER OPERATIONS IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND ACROSS THE NATION? WAS THIS ONE OF THE LARGEST ONES, OR CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW BIG THIS WAS? THIS, IN FACT, WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE SITE ENFORCEMENT OPERATION IN THE HISTORY OF HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS. OKAY. ANY LAST QUESTIONS? ACROSS THE COUNTRY? YES. LAST QUESTION. YEAH. DID HELGA BATTERY, DID THEY USE E-VERIFY IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES? I DON’T WANT TO ANSWER FOR THEM. ONE QUICK ONE. IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF LABOR TRAFFICKING AT THIS POINT? THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS PART OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WE’RE DOING EMPLOYMENT INVESTIGATIONS. AS I’VE INDICATED, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHARGES FILING, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR. OKAY. THANK YOU FOLKS. APPRECIATE IT. WE WE WE CAN HANDLE ANY FOLLOW ONS AFTER THE FACT. OKAY. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. YOU JUST HEARD FROM HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS. THEY WERE CONFIRMING DETAILS ABOUT THEIR OPERATION AT THE HYUNDAI MEGA BATTERY PLANT. 475 ARRESTS WERE MADE AS PART OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. WE’RE TOLD A MAJORITY OF THOSE WERE KOREAN NATIONALS. WE’RE TOLD THIS WAS THE LARGEST SINGLE ENFORCEMENT OPERATION IN THE HISTORY OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACROSS THE U.S. YOU CAN WATCH THE FULL PRESS CONFERENCE AND GET THE LATEST UPDATES RIGHT NOW ON.

South Korean workers detained during a massive immigration raid in Georgia Thursday will be returned to South Korea on a chartered flight following negotiations, an official announced Sunday.

“Negotiations for the release of the detained workers have been concluded, after swift responses by the relevant ministries, business agencies, and companies,” said South Korean Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik.

“However, some administrative procedures remain, and once they’re completed, a chartered plane will depart to bring back our citizens,” he added.

The workers were among 475 detained Thursday during a large-scale immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant in Ellabell, Georgia, which houses an electric vehicle battery plant jointly operated by South Korea-based companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution. About 300 of those detained are South Korean, officials said.

The operation was one of the most extensive immigration raids in recent U.S. history and the largest so far of President Donald Trump’s crackdowns at workspaces across the country.

The South Korean government has been actively working to secure the workers’ release, along with the Korean Embassy in Washington, D.C., and the Consulate General in Atlanta.

“To prevent a recurrence of similar cases, we will work together with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the companies concerned, to review and improve the visa system and stay status of people traveling to the U.S. for investment projects,” Kang said Sunday.

“The government will ensure that all necessary measures are effectively implemented to achieve both the swift release of our detained citizens and the stable implementation of the investment projects.”

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung previously called for “all-out necessary measures” to support the detainees.

In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for LG Energy Solution said the company was cooperating with the process: “We will commit our best efforts to ensure the safe and prompt return of our employees and those of our partners.”

CNN has reached out to the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Hyundai for comment.

In earlier statements to CNN, LG Energy Solution said its head of Human Resources was traveling to Georgia to aid in the release of detained South Korean nationals.

The company also said it was suspending most of its business trips to the U.S.

“Currently traveling employees are advised to immediately return home or remain at their accommodations, considering their current work status,” a statement read.

“The ‘prompt release’ of the detained individuals is our top priority right now,” LG Energy Solution Chief Human Resources Officer Kim Ki-soo said in the statement.

A spokesperson for Hyundai said in a statement Friday, “Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws.”

As the report warns, such misreporting can foster public misunderstanding of human rights and erode confidence in the judiciary, even placing judges at personal risk.
In many instances, media coverage continued to report human rights claims even after tribunals had rejected them, creating the impression that the ECHR was blocking deportations and undermining immigration control.
Home Office data up to June 2021 showed that just 0.73% of foreign national offenders successfully appealed deportation solely on human rights grounds.
The Bonavero Institute further highlighted that judgments against the UK in the European Court of Human Rights are very infrequent.","A significant new report published last week by the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights at the University of Oxford's Faculty of Law has found widespread misrepresentations in UK media coverage of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its role in immigration control.

You can download the 36-page report here. It was authored by Victoria Adelmant and Professor Başak Çalı of the Bonavero Institute, and Professor Alice Donald of Middlesex University.

The academic study, which systematically reviewed 379 media reports between January and June 2025, revealed that over 75% of articles mentioning the ECHR focused on immigration, with particular attention to deportation cases involving foreign national offenders. Much of the coverage of the ECHR and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) was found to be inaccurate or incomplete, presenting a misleading picture of human rights law being used to thwart the Government's attempts to control immigration.

The authors stated: ""We found that, when subjected to rigorous analysis, fact-checking, and scrutiny of claims made about legal frameworks and cases, many news reports and opinion pieces about immigration and the ECHR or the ECtHR were misleading and based on misconceptions, often mischaracterising UK immigration law, the UK's appeals system, and the role played by the ECHR and ECtHR.""

As the report warns, such misreporting can foster public misunderstanding of human rights and erode confidence in the judiciary, even placing judges at personal risk. Lady Chief Justice Carr has warned that ""unfair or sensational negative reporting creates real, everyday risks to the safety and lives of judges and their families."" The Bonavero Institute notes that misleading portrayals of the ECHR's role in tribunal cases are contributing to increased calls for the UK to leave the Convention, despite judges making decisions according to rules and exceptions set by Parliament.

One widely reported case cited as an example is the claim that an Albanian man avoided deportation under Article 8 of the Convention (the right to private and family life) because his child disliked foreign chicken nuggets. As the report clarifies, this was not the reason for the First-tier Tribunal's original decision, and importantly, the Upper Tribunal had already overturned the ruling by the time it was widely reported in the media. Researchers found that this case was one of many in which news articles reported on First-tier Tribunal decisions that had already been overturned on appeal, without clarifying that the original ruling no longer stood at the time of publication.

Media outlets have also misrepresented the arguments made by appellants or their lawyers in deportation cases, presenting them as if they were the basis of the Tribunal's decision. While appellants are entitled to submit any arguments they believe may support their case, not all are accepted as legally valid. In many instances, media coverage continued to report human rights claims even after tribunals had rejected them, creating the impression that the ECHR was blocking deportations and undermining immigration control.

The report further highlights a pattern of misleading media coverage in immigration tribunal cases, in which specific details are presented as decisive when they were not central to the decision. One high-profile example involved a Palestinian man who, having become a British citizen, sought to bring his brother, sister-in-law, and their children from Gaza to the UK in January 2024. The family applied using the Ukraine Family Scheme form because no other form applied and Home Office guidance advises using the closest-matching route. Their initial application was rejected, and their appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was unsuccessful. In January 2025, however, the Upper Tribunal allowed the appeal, finding that the rejection violated Article 8 of the ECHR. The Upper Tribunal concluded that the family faced extreme risks in Gaza, including indiscriminate violence and political persecution, which constituted ""very compelling or exceptional circumstances"" outweighing public interest.

Despite this, media reports frequently misrepresented the case as if the decision allowed settlement under the Ukraine Family Scheme. Lady Chief Justice Carr later condemned such reporting, noting that ""it is dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law. The judgment is the only accurate source of information."" The Bonavero Institute notes that this is not an isolated occurrence, as minor or irrelevant details from tribunal cases - such as the 'chicken nuggets' example or the 'pet cat' case cited by Theresa May in 2011 - have repeatedly been misreported as decisive, shaping public perception in ways that do not reflect the legal reasoning applied

The Bonavero Institute stresses that deportations can generally only be prevented under the ECHR on two limited circumstances: if an individual faces a real risk of torture, inhuman treatment, or death abroad (Articles 2 and 3), or if removal would cause ""unduly harsh"" consequences for family life (Article 8), and even then only within the framework set by UK parliamentary law.

Statistical evidence suggests that successful appeals are rare. Home Office data up to June 2021 showed that just 0.73% of foreign national offenders successfully appealed deportation solely on human rights grounds. Overall, around 3.5% of human rights-based appeals were allowed, with those based only on family life making up about 2.5%. The Bonavero Institute further highlighted that judgments against the UK in the European Court of Human Rights are very infrequent. Since 1980, only 13 cases have found that a UK deportation or extradition would violate the Convention, with just four concerning family life. In the past 45 years, the Court has ruled against the UK's immigration rules only three times, in cases involving discrimination.

The report notes that this picture is obscured by the lack of clear and accessible government data on human rights-based appeals. Misreporting of tribunal cases is exacerbated by the absence of comprehensive statistics, which undermines informed public debate. To address this, the report recommends that the Home Office systematically collect and publish figures on the outcomes of appeals to the First-tier and Upper Tribunals, supporting evidence-based policy-making and strengthening public confidence in the immigration system.

Professor Alice Donald commented: ""Our findings show that much of the public discussion about the ECHR and immigration is not grounded in accurate reporting. For a debate of such importance, it is essential that arguments are based on evidence and a correct understanding of the law. Without this, public trust in the rule of law is placed at risk.""",https://i.imgur.com/VGsLuOb.png,N,,2025-09-07 18:56:22.520444

In her MSNBC appearance, Healey said she hasn't heard from the White House about this latest ICE surge in her state.
It undermines the efforts of local law enforcement and it's taking guardspeople with really important missions away from those missions, all to be part of some political theater...
""It is wrong and if you care about public safety you work with local officials, you work with state officials, you support and fund local law enforcement.
We expect that federal law enforcement will abide by the constitution and laws of this City, Commonwealth, and country, and we are prepared to take legal action at any evidence to the contrary.","Gov. Maura Healey lashed out against the Trump administration in an appearance on MSNBC on Sunday, saying expanded ICE activity in Massachusetts and other states ""insane,"" and ""not right.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting a follow-up to a surge in May called Operation Patriot 2.0, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is a part of, told NBC10 Boston on Saturday. The May operation, Operation Patriot, resulted in nearly 1,500 people being arrested, officials said at the time.

In her MSNBC appearance, Healey said she hasn't heard from the White House about this latest ICE surge in her state.

""I'm a former prosecutor, a former attorney general. I've said many, many times, including to Trump, that I support as attorney general, and now as governor, everything we can do on public safety,"" she said. ""But what we have seen from ICE and the administration isn't about public safety, it's about political theater, about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate.""

""We've seen construction workers, nannies, landscapers, healthcare aids -- these are the people being taken in huge numbers, taken away from their families. It is not the kind of effort Donald Trump has said it was about.""

""But again, this is about show, it's a show of force, it's political theater. The same reason you see the National Guard on streets in cities in America. It's just not right. It's not helpful to public safety. It undermines the efforts of local law enforcement and it's taking guardspeople with really important missions away from those missions, all to be part of some political theater... It's just not right what's happening across America right now.""

Healey also criticized Trump's social media post on Saturday, where the president signaled Chicago deportations with a parody meme referencing the 1979 film ""Apocalypse Now"" on Truth Social, saying ""I love the smell of deportations in the morning...Chicago about to find out why its called the Department of WAR.""

""The post that the president put out last night bragging about some Chicago apocalypse, it's just insane. It's not normal. It's not right,"" Healey said. ""It is wrong and if you care about public safety you work with local officials, you work with state officials, you support and fund local law enforcement. That's really what you need to do.""

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu issued a new statement Sunday addressing ICE, and saying the city could take legal action if it finds federal law enforcement isn't following local, state or federal laws:

As ordered in the Boston Trust Act, no Boston police or local resources will be co-opted into federal immigration enforcement and their mass deportation agenda. For months, ICE has refused to provide any information about their activities in Boston and refuses to issue warrants, while we hear reports of ICE agents taking parents as they are dropping their kids off at school. That does not make our community safer. We expect that federal law enforcement will abide by the constitution and laws of this City, Commonwealth, and country, and we are prepared to take legal action at any evidence to the contrary.

The mayor has reiterated that its policies on immigrants -- limiting local officials' cooperation with deportation enforcement -- have made it among the country's safest cities, including in her response to a federal lawsuit filed this week over Boston's ""sanctuary"" law, the Boston Trust Act.

Wu previously released a statement to NBC10 Boston on Saturday night addressing the latest operation in the area, saying, ""For months, the Trump DOJ, DHS, and ICE have been spreading blatant lies and threatening to 'bring hell' to cities like Boston who refuse to bow down to their authoritarian agenda, so this unconstitutional attack is not a surprise.""

""This country was born facing down bullies, with Bostonians leading the way,"" Wu continued. ""Today Boston is the safest major city in the country because we have worked to build trust in the community, so that everyone feels safe seeking help or reporting a crime. We will not be bullied or intimidated into abandoning the efforts that make Boston a safe home for everyone.”

It wasn't immediately clear how many federal agents were taking part in Operation Patriot 2.0, or what Massachusetts communities the operation was being conducted in. The New York Times, citing sources, reported that the operation was expected to last several weeks; the DHS spokesperson's statement didn't address how long Patriot 2.0 would take.

What is different now is the degree of disdain Mr. Trump has shown for Congress — and the willingness of G.O.P.
They also have not scheduled any action to block the Trump administration from its latest move to unilaterally claw back money that has already been appropriated just weeks before the end of the fiscal year.
Defense officials said they would only allow bipartisan visits to military intelligence facilities, a requirement members of Congress said had never been in place before.
“Is congressional oversight dead?” Mr. Warner asked afterward, wondering aloud how independent intelligence assessments would be made if lawmakers could not have access to the agencies.","The Pentagon barred the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee from making an oversight visit to a military spy agency.

Armed forces off the coast of Venezuela began a military campaign against alleged members of a drug cartel without any authorization from Congress, and without notifying key members.

The White House informed Congress it planned to use a rare maneuver to skirt a vote and cancel nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funding that lawmakers had already approved, the latest escalation of its campaign to undercut the legislative branch’s spending powers.

And just a month after senators had confirmed her, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, ousted the director of the Centers for Disease Control. He also put forward changes that would effectively restrict access to Covid-19 vaccines, after pledging to senators during his own confirmation hearings that he would not make it more difficult.

The Trump administration continues to erode the power of Congress, trampling on its constitutional prerogatives in ways large and small. Through it all, Republicans in charge have mostly shrugged — and in some cases, outright applauded — as their powers, once jealously guarded, diminish in ways that will be difficult to reverse.

In recent weeks, G.O.P. leaders have looked on passively as the president has fired a litany of agency leaders whom senators worked for weeks to confirm, from the C.D.C. to the Internal Revenue Service to the Federal Reserve.

And they have shown little appetite for challenging the administration, even as a few have expressed occasional displeasure about the consequences of their decisions earlier this year to swallow their reservations about some of his nominees and confirm them.

“We cannot cede power,” Mr. Welch added. “There are consequences.”

For nearly a century, Democratic and Republican presidents alike have sought to amass more power, particularly to conduct foreign policy and military operations, and with a few exceptions, succeeded in chipping away at congressional influence. What is different now is the degree of disdain Mr. Trump has shown for Congress — and the willingness of G.O.P. leaders to defer to him even when it means undercutting their coequal branch of government.

“That is the big story here — not that a president is trying to push the bounds of their authority, because our system was designed with that in mind,” Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, said in an interview. “The true story is that Republicans in Congress have capitulated and are not pushing back to assert authority.”

Republicans largely reject the idea that they have ceded congressional powers of oversight and spending to the White House. They argue that Mr. Trump is wielding his executive authority appropriately to bring a vast federal bureaucracy to heel, and pointed to the testy hearing featuring Mr. Kennedy as proof that they are willing to scrutinize the administration’s actions.

But so far, their most tangible response has come in the form of mild protests from a few Republicans.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican and an orthopedic surgeon, raised eyebrows when he told Mr. Kennedy at last week’s hearing that he had “grown deeply concerned” about his handling of vaccines, after reminding the secretary that he had “promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines” during his confirmation hearings.

But Republicans have yet to announce any oversight hearings on the matter.

They also have not scheduled any action to block the Trump administration from its latest move to unilaterally claw back money that has already been appropriated just weeks before the end of the fiscal year.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, called the proposal a “clear violation of the law,” and has been working with top Senate Democrats to add new safeguards to next year’s spending bills that would ensure the Trump administration allocates federal dollars as lawmakers intend.

“Congress alone bears the constitutional responsibility for funding our government,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said this week. “And any effort to claw back resources outside of the appropriations process undermines that responsibility.”

But party leaders appear unlikely to intercede to reject the effort.

Republicans also have been remarkably quiet as the Trump administration seeks to circumvent oversight on issues of national security and intelligence, traditionally an area where Congress’s role has been seen as sacrosanct.

While it has been generations since Congress used its formal power to declare war, it did authorize both the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan, albeit with broad laws that would end up allowing presidents of both parties to exercise military might in ways lawmakers might not have anticipated.

The campaign against Venezuelan drug cartels announced last week by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser, is not covered by any congressional authorization. While the Trump administration did not offer any legal justification, experts said that in the absence of any act of Congress, the military action could only be justified under a legal theory that the president has broad authority to use the military as he sees fit.

“There’s absolutely no question the president doesn’t have the power to take airstrikes on boats outside U.S. waters with no authorization of war,” Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said. “This president believes he’s above the law. He doesn’t believe the law applies to him. He doesn’t believe the Constitution applies to him, and if we act like that’s normal, then we just encourage the continued illegal constitutional behavior.”

The failure to inform Congress about its attack on a Venezuelan boat this week, lawmakers said, was part of a pattern by the Trump administration of ignoring requirements to inform lawmakers and withholding information about national security matters that other presidents would have shared.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the first Trump administration had failed to notify Congress of a risky military incursion into North Korea to plant a listening device in 2019. Only under the Biden administration were key members of Congress told of the secret mission that led to the death of several North Koreans but did not achieve its goal.

“There is just no situation in which an intelligence operation, a special operation, of this magnitude, whether it is successful or not successful, should be conducted without Congress knowing about it,” said Mr. Crow, who requested a briefing on the operation after the Times story was published. “North Korea is a dangerous and volatile regime. The idea that you are going to just send in a military operation to a country like that without involving the United States Congress is beyond absurd.”

Members of Congress have complained the withholding of information has continued, and grown worse, during Mr. Trump’s second term. Lawmakers who sit on the congressional intelligence committees have been alarmed that the Trump administration is withholding classified assessments of the state of Iran’s nuclear program that would have been shared with them in the past.

Given that American spy agencies operate in secret, denying the public knowledge of either their covert operations or their analytic assessments of U.S. adversaries, congressional oversight is effectively the only way to hold intelligence agencies accountable.

But this week, the Pentagon announced it would block a visit by Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency after Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer who holds no official role in the Trump administration, criticized the planned visit.

Defense officials said they would only allow bipartisan visits to military intelligence facilities, a requirement members of Congress said had never been in place before. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the intelligence panel, lodged no public protest.

The curbs on congressional oversight come during an unusual purge of seasoned intelligence officers, from the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the top analyst at the N.G.A., which Mr. Warner was blocked from visiting.

“Is congressional oversight dead?” Mr. Warner asked afterward, wondering aloud how independent intelligence assessments would be made if lawmakers could not have access to the agencies.

“Where does this end?” Mr. Warner went on. “If none of my Republican colleagues raises an issue, does this mean we are ceding all oversight?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/00dc-power-tlvb/00dc-power-tlvb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 19:56:26.041301

Austrian authorities have already submitted a formal response, but the court says more clarifications are required before a final ruling.

Background of the Case

The extension follows the court’s earlier intervention in August, when it imposed a temporary halt under an urgent “interim measure.” That step was influenced by a recent case in which another Syrian deportee disappeared upon arrival in Syria. In that instance, the man — later convicted of terrorist affiliations — was eventually deported despite UN objections, prompting criticism of Austria’s policies.

In the current case, Die Presse reports, the individual is a Syrian refugee convicted in Austria of multiple crimes, including theft, burglary, and concealing official documents. He has also repeatedly evaded Austrian authorities. His parents and siblings live in Syria, but he insists he fled in 2022 to escape the war and threats to his life.

Austria’s Position

Austria’s Federal Office for Immigration and Asylum maintains that the man could “safely travel” back to his home area, citing assurances from Syrian authorities that returnees would be monitored and protected. Officials argue that his region is not experiencing armed conflict, security incidents are relatively limited, and many Syrians have already returned.

The Interior Ministry stressed that the ECHR’s halt is part of normal procedure, noting the court often issues interim measures based only on the applicant’s claims. It said Austria remains committed to deportations while monitoring conditions in Syria, in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.

Human Rights Concerns

The deportation issue has raised alarm among rights groups. Austria recently carried out its first forced return of a Syrian in nearly 15 years — a man convicted of financing ISIS — despite objections from the European Court of Justice and NGOs, which denounced the move as a breach of international protection standards.

The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances has pressed Vienna to seek official confirmation from Damascus about deportees’ fate, including their location, detention conditions, and guarantees of safety. Austria has so far resisted such requests, fueling concerns about accountability.

Legal and Humanitarian Questions

The man’s lawyer, Roxandra Steico, warned that his case illustrates the core problem: “No one can say what will happen after deportation to Syria because the situation there is not safe or stable, and it is still changing.” She added that neither his family nor his defense team has managed to reach him since proceedings began.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed.","President Donald Trump has promised to remove millions of people from the United States in the largest deportation program in American history. But his immigration agenda is facing various tests in the U.S. courts.

For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court.

Some of the president's policies affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny:

Alien Enemies Act

The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to remove people it accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing it's an invading force.

The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S. history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.

More than 250 of the men who were deported by the U.S. to El Salvador were returned to Venezuela earlier this summer in a complex deal brokered between the three countries. But litigation over the matter has continued.

In Tuesday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, said the ruling reined in ""the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

But Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the president has the authority “to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists.”

“We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said.

Birthright citizenship

President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The amendment's Citizenship Clause says all people born or naturalized in the U.S., and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. The Trump administration asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

States that have sued over the order — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that it ignores the plain wording of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in late July that Trump's order is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision in New Hampshire that blocked the order's enforcement nationwide.

Third-country deportations

The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan.

Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won’t take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people's due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations.

In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands.

Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel.

Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back.

California immigration stops

Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens.

The practice prompted a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in the region. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.”

A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s temporary order.

The Trump administration filed an emergency petition in early August that asks the Supreme Court to halt the lower court’s ruling, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing that it puts a “straitjacket” on federal agents.

Temporary Protected Status

The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe.

The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole.

Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. The status can be repeatedly renewed.

More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there’s war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

To qualify, they had to fly to the U.S. at their own expense and have a financial sponsor. For most people, the designation lasts for two years.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed. As a result, it’s possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. In August, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal.

On the East Coast, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge’s order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Fast-track deportations

The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years.

It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first.

Before Trump's second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

The change has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration's expansion , suggesting that it's trampling on people's due process rights.

In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole.

Cobb said the case’s “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-09-07 18:56:32.376558

United States Immigration agents detained about 475 people, including more than 300 Koreans, at an under-construction battery facility 30 miles northwest of Savannah on Sept. 4. Federal officials said the workers violated an array of immigration laws, including some who illegally crossed the U.S. border and others in the country on tourist visas that do not allow them to work.

South Korea’s Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hun-sik said in televised remarks on Sept. 7 that negotiations with the U.S. had concluded, and the workers would fly home after completing additional administrative procedures. The workers will fly to South Korea on a chartered plane, Hun-sik said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The raid on the HL-GA Battery Company plant was the largest single-site workplace enforcement operation in Department of Homeland Security history, officials said. Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement showed shackled workers being escorted onto buses.

Federal officials said during a Sept. 5 news conference the operation was primarily focused on criminal violations of employment laws, not on immigration action.

In the days after the raid, South Korea’s president vowed to bring the workers home and warned that the rights of the country’s citizens “must not be unduly violated.""

Democratic members of Congress from Georgia and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus said they were “deeply alarmed” in a Sept. 6 statement.

“Instead of targeting violent criminals, the Trump administration is going after immigrants at work and in communities of color to meet its mass deportation quotas,” wrote the group of 20 lawmakers.

During a Sept. 7 appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" White House border czar Tom Homan said the Trump administration plans to conduct more raids like the one at the Georgia plant.

South Korean officials said they will seek to improve the visa system for workers traveling to the United States to prevent future incidents.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Calderon continued to falsely claim she was taken by masked men and held in custody with others.","SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A South Los Angeles woman who claimed she was kidnapped by ICE agents pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges.

Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon, 41, is charged with conspiracy and making false statements to federal officers, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

During her arraignment Friday, a trial date of October 21 was set.

An attorney representing Calderon's family held a press conference June 30 to announce the woman had been kidnapped five days earlier at a Jack in the Box restaurant parking lot in downtown Los Angeles and brought to San Ysidro, where she was presented to an ICE staffer and handed voluntary self-deportation paperwork.

The attorney said Calderon had refused to sign the paperwork and demanded to speak to a judge and a lawyer.

In response, the lawyer said, ""she was punished'' by federal agents and sent to a warehouse in an undisclosed location where she was abused.

Prosecutors said the press conference garnered media attention and stoked fear in the community. Meanwhile, Calderon's daughter set up a GoFundMe page, requesting $4,500 and stating that Calderon ""was taken by masked men in an unmarked vehicle ... when she was on her way to work.''

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, the entire story was false and designed to generate sympathy and solicit donations.

In July, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying the story was created to malign the administration's immigration enforcement efforts.

""Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon was never arrested or kidnapped by ICE or bounty hunters -- this criminal illegal alien scammed innocent Americans for money and diverted limited DHS resources from removing the worst of the

worst from Los Angeles communities,'' DHS said. ""Politicians and activist media peddled these smears that were designed to demonize law enforcement and evade accountability. Calderon will now face justice and the media and politicians who swallowed and pushed this garbage should be embarrassed.''

Attorneys for Calderon's family who discussed the case at the press conference did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On July 3, when Calderon was still purportedly missing, federal agents ""grew concerned'' after confirming that Calderon was not in immigration custody, federal prosecutors said, and Homeland Security Investigations personnel began searching for Calderon over the July 4 holiday weekend.

On July 5, agents tracked Calderon down in a shopping plaza parking lot in Bakersfield. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Calderon continued to falsely claim she was taken by masked men and held in custody with others.

Prosecutors said video surveillance -- including images of Calderon leaving the Jack in the Box parking lot and getting into a nearby sedan -- as well as telephone records, bolster suspicions that Calderon fabricated the entire story.

""Calderon and her family knew that law enforcement was searching for her and feared for her safety, but Calderon and her family did not come forward,'' according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Instead, Calderon created what law enforcement alleges were fabricated photos of her ""rescue,'' made to look as if she was abused while in federal immigration custody and planned to hold a press conference on July 6 to increase donations to the GoFundMe page and to obtain other benefits, prosecutors said.

If convicted of both charges, Calderon would face up to 10 years in federal prison, prosecutors noted.

We’ve recently seen the consequences of this behavior: three workers at Hyundai were killed at work in the last two years.

When workers are put in danger by predatory companies like Hyundai, there is an opportunity for a constructive response from the federal government: OSHA and the NLRB have tools at their disposal to increase workplace safety. Unfortunately, the militarized federal crackdown on these workers further hurts safety at Hyundai. Workers are not the problem. Exploitative corporations are.

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,'” Trump wrote on his social media site. “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The president offered no details beyond the label “Chipocalypse Now,” a play on the title of Francis Ford Coppola’s dystopian 1979 film set in the Vietnam war, in which a character says, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”.

The post from Trump follows his repeated threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he has targeted for expanded federal enforcement. His administration is set to step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, as it did in Los Angeles, and deploy National Guard troops.

Democratic Governor of Illinois JB Pritzker, where Chicago is located, voiced outrage at Trump’s post and said the state “won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator”.

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal,” he wrote in a post on X.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also denounced Trump’s threat as “beneath the honor of our nation”.

“The reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution. We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump,” Johnson wrote on X.

Protests in Chicago, DC

In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump has deployed them since last month in Washington, DC, as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the country’s capital. He has also suggested that Baltimore and New Orleans could get the same treatment and, on Friday, even mentioned federal authorities possibly heading for Portland, Oregon, to “wipe ’em out”, meaning the protesters.

The US president on Friday also signed an order changing the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, saying it sends “a message of victory” to the world.

The troop and federal agent deployments have prompted legal challenges and protests, with critics calling them an authoritarian show of force.

On Saturday, more than a thousand protesters marched through the streets of downtown Chicago, with signs bearing slogans like “I.C.E. out of Illinois, I.C.E. out of everywhere”, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

Speakers offered the crowd instructions on what to do if encountering ICE agents. They also drew comparisons between the proposed ICE crackdown on Chicago and Israel’s presence in Gaza.

“We are inspired by the steadfastness of Palestinians in Gaza, and it is why we refuse to cower to Trump and his threats,” Nazek Sankari, co-chair of the US Palestinian Community Network, said to the crowd as many waved Palestinian flags and donned keffiyehs.

Viviana Barajas, leader with the community organisation Palenque LSNA, promised that Chicagoans would “stand up” as Los Angeles had if Trump deployed the National Guard in their city.

“If he thinks these frivolous theatrics to undermine our sovereignty will shut out the passion we have for protecting our people, this is Chicago, and he is sorely mistaken,” Barajas said. “We have been studying LA and DC, and they have stood up for their cities.”

In the US capital, protesters at the “We Are All DC” march, who also included supporters of Palestinian statehood, marched behind a bright red banner reading, “END THE D.C. OCCUPATION”, in English and Spanish.

They chanted slogans denouncing Trump and carried posters, some of which read, “Trump must go now,” “Free DC”, and “Resist Tyranny”.

Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC, said the protesters were “furious” of Trump’s order, and were calling him “a fascist and an authoritarian”.

She noted that Trump had deployed the 2,000 troops last month to fight what he called a surge in violent crime, but that such offences in the US capital last year had hit “a 30-year low”.

Mark Fitzpatrick, a former US diplomat who has been a DC resident for about a decade, told The Associated Press news agency on Saturday that he was worried about the “authoritarian nature” in which the administration is treating DC.

“Federal agents, national guards patrolling our streets, that’s really an affront to the democracy of our city,” he said, adding that it is worse for DC residents due to their lack of federal representation. “We don’t have our own senators or members of the House of Representatives, so we’re at the mercy of a dictator like this, a wanna-be dictator.”

Among the protesters on Saturday was Jun Lee, a printmaker artist, who showed up with a “Free DC” sign that she made on a woodcut block.

She said she came to the protest because she was “saddened and heartbroken” about the impact of the federal intervention on her city.

“This is my home, and I never, ever thought all the stuff that I watched in a history documentary that I’m actually living in person, and this is why this is important for everyone. This is our home; we need to fight, we need to resist,” she said.

Trump has suggested that he has nearly limitless powers when it comes to deploying the National Guard. At times he has even touched on questions about his being a dictator.

“Most people are saying, ‘If you call him a dictator, if he stops crime, he can be whatever he wants’. I am not a dictator, by the way,” Trump said last month.

He added, “Not that I don’t have – I would – the right to do anything I want to do.”

“I’m the president of the United States,” Trump said. “If I think our country is in danger – and it is in danger in these cities – I can do it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25250006275774-1757209909.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-07 11:57:51.561509

Costumed performers and children with baskets of treats paraded through the community, drawing cheers from families lining the sidewalks.

But the joy of the annual celebration came with an undercurrent of unease this year. Bright orange whistles swung from the necks of parade-goers and dancers, each one ready to cut through the music should federal immigration agents appear.

The caution reflects fears across the city that Chicago could be the next target of President Donald Trump’s intense immigration crackdown. Independence Day festivities in the Windy City this year were quieter, some even postponed, under the weight of the looming threats.

But in Pilsen, the neighborhood gathered anyway, choosing joy over fear.

“It’s always a good moment to celebrate our culture, our customs,” Araceli Lucio, a parade-goer and longtime resident, told CNN. “I think now more than ever is when we need to demonstrate that we are united and we are a community.”

Celebrations thwarted

The Mexican holiday usually draws hundreds of thousands of attendees to more than a week of celebrations across Chicago that began Saturday. But in response to the anticipated ramp-up of immigration enforcement, streets are quieter as events have been muted.

In Wauconda, a village in northwest Chicago, the annual Latino Heritage Festival was canceled due to “the recent weather situation and immigration concerns in our area,” the Wauconda Police Department said in a Friday social media post.

Fiesta Patrias, one of the largest Mexican Independence Day events, has been postponed for the first time in its 30-year history to November 1 from September 14. The festival is celebrated every year in Waukegan, a suburb along Lake Michigan just north of the Great Lakes naval base, the facility Gov. JB Pritzker said Trump is set to use as a command center for incoming immigration agents.

“I know that the vendors perhaps are upset, but it is what it is – for the safety of the people,” said Margaret Carrasco, president of Fiesta Patrias.

El Grito Chicago, a two-day festival in downtown’s Grant Park, also decided to postpone citing concerns for the “safety of our community.”

“We’re saddened about the loss of an opportunity to uplift a vision of dignity, strength, and belonging at a time when it’s sorely needed,” event organizers said in a statement.

Pilsen parade-goers acknowledged the fear and hesitation in these pockets of the city’s Latino communities, backing organizers’ decisions to put a hold on their events.

“We’re with them, we support them, we understand what they’re feeling,” Claudia Villagrana, who celebrated Saturday in Pilsen, told CNN.

Illinois Reps. Mike Quigley and Jesús “Chuy” García were also seen walking in Saturday’s parade in Pilsen, as state officials have been heeding warnings of the impending immigration enforcement in Chicago.

A city bracing for impact

Officials in Chicago have been monitoring days of warnings the city could be the next target of Trump’s expanding enforcement efforts across the country.

The president and his aides have repeatedly slammed Chicago over policies limiting cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration enforcement. Chicago grappled with an influx of migrants during the Biden administration following surges along the US southern border and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s decision to transport migrants to Democratic-led cities.

Chicago was also among the first cities targeted in immigration enforcement operations when Trump took office in January.

Now, the anticipated operations in Chicago are expected to be on a larger scale, using personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and possibly other agencies, CNN previously reported.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an order last weekend aimed at resisting the crackdown, laying out plans for the city amid “escalating threats from the federal government.”

The order “affirms” Chicago police will not “collaborate with federal agents on joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations, or other law enforcement duties including civil immigration enforcement.”

But residents are still bracing for impact.

Communities are preparing for ICE presence by handing out flyers reminding families they have the right to remain silent, don’t have to consent to be searched and don’t have to share their birthplace or citizenship status, among other rights.

Sylvelia Pittman, a teacher at Nash Elementary on Chicago’s West Side, said she heard children in her classroom talking about potential ICE arrests on Friday.

Before leaving for the weekend, Pittman said, students said goodbye to each other, saying “I hope to see you next week.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2234051559-20250907014938180.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-07 12:56:51.955032

“Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” the president said in a social media post, referring to the department he claimed to rename Friday.

Trump accompanied his post with an AI-generated image of himself in a Civil War-era military hat, evoking the film “Apocalypse Now.”

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,’” Trump added in another allusion to the movie.

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) wrote in response to Trump’s post on social media.

“This is not a joke,” the governor added. “This is not normal.”

“Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man. Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Pritzker warned Tuesday that Trump is preparing to deploy the Texas National Guard against Chicago over the governor’s repeated objections.

Trump’s threat comes as his administration is organizing massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Chicago, the country’s third-largest city.

As part of its build-up for the raids, the government relocated hundreds of federal agents to the city and staged vehicles and resources on nearby federal properties.

The Department of Defense has allowed ICE to use a Navy base on the outskirts of Chicago as a staging base for the raids. The arrangement heavily blurs the line between civil and military authority.

Pritzker said that Trump may be planning to use the ICE raids to provoke unrest in the city and create a pretext to deploy troops in Chicago.

The Trump administration’s aggressive immigration operations in Los Angeles this summer incited protests, which Trump then cited in orders deploying National Guard troops and Marines to the city.

Legal experts have told Democracy Docket that Trump sending the Texas National Guard into Illinois would dangerously threaten state sovereignty.

In a fundraising email to his supporters this week, Trump vowed to “liberate” Chicago.

Trump’s post came as several thousand D.C. residents marched in the nation’s capital to demand an end to Trump’s massive troop deployment in the district.

In addition to Chicago, Trump in recent days has threatened to deploy the military against New York, Portland, Oakland and other major cities.

The president has falsely portrayed the cities, which are in Democratic-run states, as being overrun with violent crime, while largely ignoring cities in Republican-run states that have higher crime rates.

His ongoing military deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. — and the potential deployment in Chicago — have sparked concerns that Trump may deploy troops or law enforcement in key Democratic strongholds to undermine future elections.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the operation, dubbed “Patriot 2.0,” followed a similar sweep in May. The agency said those taken into custody included individuals accused of sexual assault, drug trafficking and gang activity who had been released from local jails despite federal requests to hold them. Officials said Boston’s policies allowed dangerous offenders to remain in communities instead of being deported.

President Donald Trump, who has deployed National Guard troops and federal law enforcement officers to Washington, has also threatened repeatedly to send forces into Chicago to tackle crime there.

On Saturday, the president posted a meme on Truth Social evoking the Vietnam War-themed movie Apocalypse Now, with a caption that said, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” and saying Chicago is about to find out why he changed the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War.

Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, was asked Sunday during an interview with CNN’s on whether enforcement activities are expected in Chicago this week. “Absolutely,” he replied. “You can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country.”

But his immigration agenda is facing various tests in the U.S. courts.

For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court.

Some of the president's policies affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny:

Alien Enemies Act

The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to remove people it accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing it's an invading force.

The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S. history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.

More than 250 of the men who were deported by the U.S. to El Salvador were returned to Venezuela earlier this summer in a complex deal brokered between the three countries. But litigation over the matter has continued.

In Tuesday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, said the ruling reined in ""the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

But Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the president has the authority “to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists.”

“We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said.

Birthright citizenship

President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The amendment's Citizenship Clause says all people born or naturalized in the U.S., and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. The Trump administration asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

States that have sued over the order — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that it ignores the plain wording of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in late July that Trump's order is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision in New Hampshire that blocked the order's enforcement nationwide.

Third-country deportations

The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan.

Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won’t take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people's due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations.

In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands.

Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel.

Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back.

California immigration stops

Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens.

The practice prompted a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in the region. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.”

A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s temporary order.

The Trump administration filed an emergency petition in early August that asks the Supreme Court to halt the lower court’s ruling, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing that it puts a “straitjacket” on federal agents.

Temporary Protected Status

The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe.

The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole.

Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. The status can be repeatedly renewed.

More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there’s war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

To qualify, they had to fly to the U.S. at their own expense and have a financial sponsor. For most people, the designation lasts for two years.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed. As a result, it’s possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. In August, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal.

On the East Coast, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge’s order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Fast-track deportations

The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years.

It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first.

Before Trump's second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

The change has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration's expansion, suggesting that it's trampling on people's due process rights.

In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole.

Cobb said the case’s “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sscC2JnjzhmpxUnOafoR3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/81a0c489d571648201223b04c2be2240,N,,2025-09-07 11:57:20.116499

For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court.

Some of the president’s policies affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny:

Alien Enemies Act

The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to remove people it accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing it’s an invading force.

The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S. history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.

More than 250 of the men who were deported by the U.S. to El Salvador were returned to Venezuela earlier this summer in a complex deal brokered between the three countries. But litigation over the matter has continued.

In Tuesday’s ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, said the ruling reined in “the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

But Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the president has the authority “to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists.”

“We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said.

Birthright citizenship

President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The amendment’s Citizenship Clause says all people born or naturalized in the U.S., and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. The Trump administration asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

States that have sued over the order — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that it ignores the plain wording of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in late July that Trump’s order is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision in New Hampshire that blocked the order’s enforcement nationwide.

Third-country deportations

The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan.

Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won’t take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people’s due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations.

In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands.

Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel.

Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back.

California immigration stops

Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens.

The practice prompted a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in the region. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.”

A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s temporary order.

The Trump administration filed an emergency petition in early August that asks the Supreme Court to halt the lower court’s ruling, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing that it puts a “straitjacket” on federal agents.

Temporary Protected Status

The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe.

The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole.

Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. The status can be repeatedly renewed.

More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there’s war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

To qualify, they had to fly to the U.S. at their own expense and have a financial sponsor. For most people, the designation lasts for two years.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed. As a result, it’s possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. In August, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal.

On the East Coast, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge’s order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Fast-track deportations

The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years.

It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first.

Before Trump’s second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

The change has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration’s expansion, suggesting that it’s trampling on people’s due process rights.

In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole.

Cobb said the case’s “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”

After the ethics complaint was filed, Libs of TikTok egged on Arizona senate Republicans.
The ethics complaint details how Ortiz did not back away from her reshare after Libs of TikTok posted about it.
“Senator Ortiz’s post is clearly protected speech under the first amendment,” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said in a statement.
“This ethics complaint is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to intimidate and silence a democratically elected legislator.","A Democratic lawmaker in Arizona who is facing calls for expulsion for resharing an Instagram post warning of immigration enforcement activity near an elementary school said that state senate Republicans “absolutely are trying to make an example out of me”.

Analise Ortiz, a Democratic state senator in Arizona, shared an Instagram post from a community organization that warned, in text only, that immigration enforcement agents were near a local elementary school.

“Alert/Alerta: ICE activity near Southwest Elementary,” the post in early August said, adding the cross streets of the school. “ICE is present. La migra esta presente.”

That post is at the center of an ethics complaint filed this week against Ortiz and a viral rightwing campaign against her.

“The ethics complaint very clearly says that they want to stop other people from sharing this type of information,” she said, calling it “a stunning escalation of intimidation”.

The controversy began when Libs of TikTok, the X account known for going after liberals online, posted about Ortiz’s reshare, claiming she was “actively impeding and doxxing ICE by posting their live locations on instagram” and that law enforcement officials should “charge her”.

No photos of agents were shared, nor were names or other identifying information about agents.

“I was not there,” Ortiz said. “There were no pictures of anybody taken. It was simply a post that said Ice presence is possible outside of an elementary school. And I think that the fact that they are outside of sensitive locations where kids should be able to learn in peace is something that people should know about. They should know how the government is acting on their behalf.”

The Libs of TikTok post went viral, leaving Ortiz with an inbox full of harassing and threatening messages. The mischaracterization that she “doxed” agents had led to the vast majority of the threats she had received, she said.

Jake Hoffman, a Republican state senator, and a handful of other Republican leaders in the chamber filed a formal ethics complaint that seeks to expel Ortiz from the chamber or, failing a vote to expel, remove her from all committees and take away her office and administrative staff. The ethics committee chair also referred the complaint to the US attorney’s office in Arizona for a potential investigation, saying Ortiz’s actions “may implicate federal law”.

After the ethics complaint was filed, Libs of TikTok egged on Arizona senate Republicans. “Make an example out of her! Enough is enough,” the account tweeted.

“What surprised me about the ethics complaint was the level of punishment they want to inflict upon me for simply exercising my first amendment right,” Ortiz said.

As immigration enforcement agents have ramped up activity across the country, activists have shared locations where they see raids or Ice agents as a way to warn people to avoid the area. In Arizona, a southern border state, fear of deportations – and of detaining people who are in the US legally – is a facet of daily life in the second Trump administration. Ortiz said she had heard from constituents who are terrified to drive without a passport on hand because they fear law enforcement won’t believe they are US citizens if they are pulled over.

Ortiz said she would not be intimidated by the ethics inquest or attempts to criminalize her sharing of information.

“If the United States of America is going to continue as a free and fair democracy, it demands that people speak out against constitutional violations,” she said. “It demands bravery, so I am going to continue to be brave in this moment.”

Hoffman claimed Ortiz’s reshare was “reckless” and “dangerous”, saying that “by publicly posting alerts about federal law enforcement activity, she actively tipped off individuals being pursued by Ice, jeopardizing the safety of officers and law-abiding citizens”. He wanted the committee to investigate her for “behavior unbecoming of an elected official and embarrassing to the entire Arizona legislature on a state and national stage”.

Hoffman was charged for his role as a fake elector after the 2020 election. Earlier this year, he was pulled over for driving 89mph in a 65mph zone in his Tesla Cybertruck emblazoned with the word “Freedom” on the back, though he was not cited because of a legal provision called legislative immunity.

The ethics complaint details how Ortiz did not back away from her reshare after Libs of TikTok posted about it. Instead, she wrote that she would alert her community to stay away when Ice is around and that she was “not fucking scared of you nor Trump’s masked goons”. After Hoffman wrote on X that he would bring an ethics complaint and wanted her expelled, she said: “Bring it on, Jake.”

Warren Petersen, the Republican state senate president, previously asked for a federal investigation into Ortiz’s reshare, claiming she may have broken a federal law that prevents “assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers or employees”.

The US attorney’s office in Arizona did not respond to a request for comment.

Ortiz said Republican lawmakers want to deprive her legislative district of its voice in the senate and silence her and others who want to stand against deportations.

“The fact they are trying to escalate it and are blatantly lying about my actions proves that this is really about authoritarianism and wanting to have a system where masked men carry out police operations in secret, and that should really concern anyone who cares about the United States constitution,” Ortiz said.

Free speech experts and other elected officials, including the state’s Democratic attorney general, have spoken out against the attacks on Ortiz for her post, which they say is well within her first amendment rights.

“Senator Ortiz’s post is clearly protected speech under the first amendment,” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said in a statement. “This ethics complaint is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to intimidate and silence a democratically elected legislator. Warren Petersen and Jake Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves for weaponizing the ethics process just because they disagree with Senator Ortiz politically.”

The ethics committee has not met yet this year and does not have operating rules in place, but will consider the complaint once those are established, said its chair, Shawnna Bolick, a Republican. An expulsion would require a two-thirds vote of the chamber, an unlikely prospect.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e97c03b7646b473da0ef98415f2a29302688d6ac/282_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da8e5609909c9491d03ee070a3537555",N,,2025-09-07 10:57:36.023821

The Council of Europe’s warning serves as a reminder that behind every policy decision on migrants lie individual human destinies.
To sustain and safeguard the asylum system, one crucial principle must be to ensure the repatriation of migrants is conducted with caution and safety.","Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the US has concluded agreements allowing the deportation of foreign migrants to South Sudan, Eswatini, and Rwanda. Leaving aside questions of effectiveness, concerns have arisen over the “fairness and morality” of such deals, as many of the deported individuals do not originate from those African nations.

In fact, deporting migrants to third countries is not a new practice. Previously, the UK pursued a similar approach through its agreement with Rwanda.

However, that plan faced both legal and political challenges. Nevertheless, the UK has continued seeking arrangements, including a deal with France to return migrants to French territory. Meanwhile, in 2024, Italy established reception centres in Albania, treating them as waiting points for the repatriation of migrants.

Although the strategy of “shifting the migration burden beyond borders” has stirred mixed reactions, other European countries have shown interest in adopting similar measures.

Recently, however, the Council of Europe issued a warning that such decisions could lead to serious human rights violations. Migrants relocated to third countries may face risks of torture, arbitrary detention, mass deportation, and denial of asylum rights or legal support.

In a statement on September 4, Michael O’Flaherty, Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, stressed that such policies could expose migrants to grave harm and prolonged suffering. His remarks came as a new World Health Organisation (WHO) report revealed that today more people than ever live in a country other than the one where they were born. While many people migrate out of choice, others migrate out of necessity. Some may be forcibly displaced from their homes as they flee persecution, conflict, violence, or disaster. Others facing adversity may also have little option but to move, for example to escape inhuman treatment, avoid economic hardship, access social rights, or reunite with families.

Yet the journey towards a “new life” is far from easy and may leave lasting scars. The migration experience itself is a decisive factor in the mental health of refugees.

According to the WHO report, refugees and migrants exposed to adversity are more likely than host populations to experience mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, and psychosis. Such adversity may stem from traumatic experiences in their homelands, hardships endured along the journey, such as violence, detention, or lack of basic services, or even from restrictive immigration policies, as well as poor living and working conditions in host countries.

In recent years, immigration has remained one of the most contentious issues for many Western countries. The effectiveness of policies to address this divisive challenge has also become a “key test” of public trust in governments.

In reality, the management of migration is by no means easy, especially in today’s complex global political climate marked by numerous conflict hotspots. The Council of Europe’s warning serves as a reminder that behind every policy decision on migrants lie individual human destinies.

If deportations are treated merely as a technical solution, the “doorways” between countries risk becoming “new borders” of injustice and suffering.

In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.
Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.
Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.
“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd.","ST PETERSBURG- A crowd of around 75 people gathered in St. Petersburg on Saturday to strategize ways to persuade the police chiefs of Tampa and St. Petersburg to void partnership agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they entered into earlier this year.

Legislation signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis requires that sheriffs or chief correctional officers operating a county detention facility must enter into a 287(g) agreement with ICE. That means that every county sheriff in the state needed to sign such an agreement this year, which they all have.

There is no requirement for municipalities to do the same, yet hundreds of police departments throughout the state have done so anyway. In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.

Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.

“In order to foster public trust and a positive relationship with the community, we ask you to cancel this heartless, inefficient 287(g) agreement before further harm is done,” read the form letters that attendees at the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg were asked to send on Saturday to Bercaw and Holloway, as well as Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. The letters were accessed through a QR code listed on pamphlets distributed by organizers at the event.

Threats to be removed from office

Addressing the crowd, activist Karla Correa showed a picture of Florida Attorney James Uthmeier, who has threatened to remove city council members who have shown inclination not to sign such agreements.

“He’s saying, no, you have to do it or else I’m going to remove you from office,” said Correa, with the Tampa Bay area chapter of the Party of Socialism and Liberation.

“He is the attorney general for the state of Florida. He has a lot of power. And he’s going along with Ron DeSantis’ agenda, and we see whenever anyone tries to fight against it, again, they threaten to remove them from office. That’s what happened in Orlando. That’s what happened in Key West. That’s what happened in Fort Myers.”

The Key West City Commission voided its police department’s 287(g) after learning that their police chief had signed such an agreement without commissioners’ knowledge. After they did that, Uthmeier publicly declared that the action had made Key West a “sanctuary city,” which is banned in Florida law. Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.

A similar situation happened with the Pinellas County School District earlier this year, with the school superintendent and the school board apparently unaware that their chief of police had signed an agreement. Once that news was made public, the district backed away from the agreement.

“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd. “Because ICE shouldn’t be in schools. But you know what happened right after? There was a huge public outcry, right? Parents came out. Teachers came out. Community members who don’t even have kids came out to fight against this and to oppose it. And you know what they did? And you won’t hear DeSantis talk about this. They voided that agreement,” she said to cheers in the audience.

In addition to asking the mayors and police chiefs of the two cities to use their authority to cancel the agreements, the activists are calling on the St. Petersburg and Tampa city councils to pass resolutions condemning the 287(g) agreements. And they want the Tampa Human Rights Board to “begin an immediate and thorough investigation of Tampa PD’s 287(g) partnership.”

SPPD responds

St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway provided a written statement to the Phoenix later on Saturday.

“To clarify, our department is not part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said. “We assist ICE only when, during the course of a lawful encounter, an individual is identified as a suspect or subject in a criminal investigation. If it is determined that the individual has an active warrant, we are legally obligated to execute that warrant, whether it’s ICE-related or not, fairly and consistently. We are not seeking, nor do we receive, funding to support ICE operations.”

Attorneys representing the state have informed a judge in a lawsuit filed by the city of South Miami regarding the confusion about the law that, in fact, municipalities in Florida are not required to sign such an agreement.

Many farmers insist they do what is required of any employer when hiring workers, but say there is a growing expectation that employers police workers’ legal status.
Yet protections for workers without legal status are limited.
For years, federal lawmakers have introduced legislation that would grant legal status to long-term workers, but it has never gotten past the Senate.
Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economics expert at Michigan State University, said the bill’s pathway to legal status may be what’s holding it back.","SHOSHONE, Idaho — Just east of town, a road cuts through sagebrush and fields of cows toward Donley Farms, where Darren Taber manages the multigenerational operation.

Taber’s 900-cow dairy requires constant attention and long hours — but it’s home.

“It’s the best place in the world to raise a family,” he said. “It’s a lot of late nights. There’s a lot of times that I’m (working) 24-hour days.”

Yet more and more, Taber has been pulled away from this work and into policy, traveling to Washington, D.C., to advocate for immigration reform that has been stalled for years.

“What I cannot stand is the fact that Congress cannot get anything across the finish line,” he said. “Maybe we can’t solve it all in one big, beautiful bill. Who knows? Maybe we can.”

The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has left farmers worried about their livelihoods and workers frightened for their lives. It’s also renewed bipartisan calls to implement reforms for the people who help feed America.

“Yeah, get the criminals out,” Taber said. “But your farmworkers are not your criminals.”

President Donald Trump has indicated he might be amenable to a solution.

In June — after reports of arrests at a New Mexico dairy, at a Nebraska meat production plant and in the fields of California — the administration ordered a pause on workplace raids in agriculture and hospitality, but it reversed course days later.

Trump then said in a July 3 speech that he was working to help farmers who depend on migrant labor — indicating his administration was making progress on legislation to address the issue.

Trump and other leaders have discussed a work program that would ensure farmers have the labor they need but would not provide amnesty for farmworkers who lack legal status.

Many farmers insist they do what is required of any employer when hiring workers, but say there is a growing expectation that employers police workers’ legal status.

“We are not ICE agents,” said Andrew Mickelsen, co-owner of Mickelsen Farms, a large potato farm in Idaho. “Last time I checked, I haven’t been deputized. I haven’t been issued a bulletproof vest or a gun, and I haven’t gotten a paycheck yet to be an ICE agent.”

Nearly 70% of people working in agriculture were not born in the United States, according to federal data, and about 42% of that workforce lacks legal status. Yet protections for workers without legal status are limited.

The H-2A visa is a temporary permit that allows farmers to hire foreign farmworkers if there aren’t enough domestic workers to fill labor needs — a growing reality for employers. In 2014, the U.S. issued around 90,000 H-2A visas. Last year, that number rose to 315,000.

Yet industries that require year-round labor, such as Idaho dairy, cannot legally hire workers using the temporary visa.

“You can guess how dependent we are on an unauthorized workforce,” said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairy Association, who wants to see legal status for existing workers and access to a visa program that can meet labor demands.

“We can’t feed ourselves as a country if we don’t find a solution to this problem,” he said.

For years, federal lawmakers have introduced legislation that would grant legal status to long-term workers, but it has never gotten past the Senate.

The latest version of the bill would allow a qualified individual with extended employment in farmwork to become a “certified agricultural worker” on the condition of continued employment.

The bill also would provide at least 20,000 H-2A visas each year for the next decade for farmers with year-round labor needs. Half of those visas would be reserved for the dairy industry.

Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economics expert at Michigan State University, said the bill’s pathway to legal status may be what’s holding it back.

“It’s hard to get bipartisan support when you’re talking about legalizing hundreds of thousands of unauthorized workers — especially in our current political climate,” Rutledge said.

Given that immigrants play an important role across many sectors of the country’s economy, tension between business interests and those who support mass deportations is growing.

“We understand the need for enforcement,” Naerebout said. “But we also have to have a conversation around immigration reform so that we don’t damage our economy.”

California has the largest number of immigrants lacking legal status in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, and is home to about half of the unauthorized agricultural worker population, statistics show.

Since January, immigration agents have arrested hundreds of people in the state — increasing fear among those who work the fields and concern from those who employ them.

As the sun rises over the golden hills of California’s Salinas Valley, the region’s 25,000 farmworkers are already hunched at the waist, planting and harvesting America’s produce.

M.M., a farmworker from Puebla, Mexico, has been in the United States for over a decade. She works long days harvesting cauliflower, tomatoes and strawberries.

She requested anonymity because she is in the U.S. without legal status and the fear looms that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers could appear at any time. She only leaves the house to go to work.

“I’m still afraid with the uncertainty of being deported,” she said. “But, oh well. We have to keep working and move forward.”

Farmworker S.H. works on a small, organic farm nestled in the fertile soil of San Benito County — part of the “Salad Bowl of the World.” His efforts contribute to the Golden State’s $58 billion agriculture industry and yet, he said: “You don’t feel safe anywhere.”

Javier Zamora is a midsize organic farmer in the Salinas Valley who immigrated to the U.S. more than four decades ago. He grows blueberries, strawberries, tomatoes and other produce on about 100 acres of land.

Zamora wonders why the Trump administration would want to deport the people who help stock grocery shelves.

“America would not be as great as it is now if all my workforce were taken away,” he said.

Lawmakers, he said, “need to wake up and they need to do something. And it needs to be done quickly — before it’s too late.”

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to state that Alan Phetsadakone was represented in the decades-old fraud case by his defense lawyer.","A federal judge ruled Friday the Department of Homeland Security must release a 47-year-old father of four whom the government is trying to deport to Laos, a country the man hasn’t seen since he was a toddler.

Alan Phetsadakone left an immigration detention center in Tacoma on Saturday morning.

Phetsadakone, a lawful permanent resident, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in July during an annual check-in, an appointment he had gone to every year without incident for more than two decades.

U.S. District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead ruled Friday evening that the man should be immediately released from the Northwest ICE Processing Center.

Whitehead wrote in the release order that Phetsadakone’s case raised “serious questions about the Government’s alleged failure to follow required procedures when re-detaining someone released on supervision.”

Phetsadakone has been living under a supervision order since 2001 tied to a bank fraud conviction. An immigration judge ordered Phetsadakone be removed to Laos in 1998, a year after he pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud for helping others cash bad checks. Because Laos does not have a formal repatriation agreement with the U.S., and has historically rarely issued travel documents for deportation, a judge released Phetsadakone after serving several months in detention.

At Phetsadakone’s hearing Friday, U.S. attorneys said the federal government had reached an agreement with Laos and had the travel documents required to deport him there within two weeks. His arrest by ICE this July was lawful and his deportation “a certainty,” said U.S. Attorney Michelle Lambert.

But Phetsadakone’s defense attorneys said they had found “smoking gun” evidence that his defense lawyer in the decades-old fraud case had improperly advised him of the risk of deportation should he plead guilty. They have requested a judge vacate that conviction, and Whitehead granted the temporary restraining order that would release Phetsadakone until there is a ruling in the criminal case.

Jennie Pasquarella, one of Phetsadakone’s attorneys, argued ICE unlawfully arrested and detained Phetsadakone this July by not notifying him in advance that his release had been revoked. The Seattle Clemency Project attorney representing him pro bono argued there is also a serious risk that he would be deported to a third country instead of Laos, a country where Phetsadakone knows no one and whose immigration policies seem to be “changing by the minute,” said Pasquarella.

The Trump administration has escalated third-country deportations in recent months, sending people to countries they have no ties to. About a dozen countries, including South Sudan, Uganda and El Salvador, have agreed to receive these deportees.

“I cannot explain why the government is doing this,” Pasquarella said at the courtroom’s podium. “If nothing else, it’s unconstitutional punishment. It’s cruel. It’s inhumane. It’s designed to punish.”

The courtroom reached capacity Friday, its benches filled with Phetsadakone’s family and supporters, including neighbors and members of a union. Some family members embraced each other as they sat down, and others waited nervously with their eyes closed.

Phetsadakone sat quietly throughout the hearing, wearing a green uniform and occasionally looking at his children and wife of 26 years, Cheryl Eugenio, who is a U.S. citizen.

Phetsadakone ran into trouble months after turning 18, when several new friends told him about a way he could “get some quick cash,” Pasquarella said. He helped the friends deposit counterfeit and stolen checks, according to federal court records.

Phetsadakone’s attorneys argue his lawyer in the fraud case gave him bad legal advice, based on a hearing recording during which the lawyer said deportation was “not certain” if he pleaded guilty. In fact, Congress had passed a law lowering the loss threshold for aggravated felonies from $200,000 to $10,000: granting the government grounds for deportation.

Therefore, his attorneys now argue, his decision to plead is “constitutionally invalid” because his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated.

After serving eight months in detention and being released on supervision, Phetsadakone attended his annual ICE check-ins “consistently, religiously (and) dutifully” for 27 years, Pasquarella said. He married Eugenio and helped raise their three children while working two jobs at a Seattle wine importer and pillow manufacturer.

Decades after receiving his supervision order, Phetsadakone’s attorneys said he had no reason to fear an unexpected outcome during his annual appointment at the ICE field office in Tukwila on July 21. Eugenio and their three children were waiting in the car, with plans to go to lunch afterward.

Instead, ICE officers arrested Phetsadakone and transported him to the agency’s detention center in Tacoma, where he has been held in custody since.

“His whole life is here,” said Eugenio. “His family is here. It’s hard. He would have to start all over in a place where he doesn’t know anyone.” Phetsadakone can’t read Lao and is not verbally fluent, Eugenio said. She thanked supporters, including people the couple had not spoken to in years, who donated to a GoFundMe for the family, which had raised nearly $10,000 on Friday.

Kane Vongsavanh, a Virginia-based immigration attorney, said while the government is not providing precise data, he estimates “upwards of 200 deportees” have been accepted by Laos since January. That’s a big increase over past years.

Many of them have had removal orders hanging over their heads for years.

“The sad part about that is most of these crimes and most of these issues happened several decades ago,” Vongsavanh said.

Several Southeast Asian countries, including Laos and Vietnam, have historically been reluctant to accept U.S. deportees.

He recommends Southeast Asian immigrants who have removal orders get their documents in order, hire an experienced immigration attorney or seek out pro bono organizations if they don’t have the financial means to hire representation.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has begun a sweeping operation in Massachusetts targeting undocumented immigrants, focusing on those with prior criminal records released by local authorities.

According to The New York Times, the coordinated operation began on Saturday, September 6, and is expected to continue for several weeks, expanding federal deportation efforts.

Officials familiar with the operation told the agency that the campaign specifically targets migrants previously detained for crimes but later released from local custody before federal processing.

The Department of Homeland Security has justified the arrests as a public safety measure. Authorities argue that state and local failures to hold detainees increase risks for communities.

This development comes as Chicago also prepares for expanded deportation operations. Local leaders there have expressed concern over potential humanitarian consequences amid already rising migrant arrivals.

In May, Massachusetts saw nearly 1,500 undocumented migrants arrested in similar federal operations. Immigration advocates warned then that large-scale enforcement disproportionately harms vulnerable families and asylum seekers.

The renewed crackdown underscores the Trump administration’s intensified immigration agenda, prioritizing enforcement actions in states where local officials have resisted deeper cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

This operation raises urgent questions about balancing national security with human rights obligations.

DHS and its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm are calling the operation Patriot 2.0, modifying the name of a May deportation surge that led to the arrest of 1,500 people in the state, according to the reports.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The operation is expected to last several weeks, the New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter. One of the sources told the Times that Patriot 2.0 was focused on targeting immigrants who had been released from custody despite ICE agents attempting to pick them up from local jails.

NBC 10 Boston quoted a statement from a DHS spokesperson as deriding Boston Mayor Michelle Wu's so-called sanctuary policies.

The bateyes started as simple settlements on sugarcane plantations and are among the most marginalised and impoverished communities in the Dominican Republic.
“The Dominican Republic is violating its own legislation,” says Wooding.","On the yellow bus rumbling through the Dominican Republic’s sugarcane fields back to the settlement, Sainristil sat among the jolting bodies of other Haitian workers in ripped orange shirts. These journeys are routine – always the same grumbling stomachs in anticipation of dinner, the same chatter among men who share a job, a home and a homeland.

But that evening, as the workers’ bus pulled into the cul-de-sac of communal housing, it came to a halt before two white buses marked with the words “Migration control”.

“They grabbed us like dogs,” says Sainristil, referring to the 3 July raid in Construcción, where uniformed men bundled 11 of the workers into the vehicles so they could be deported. Construcción is a batey, one of the Dominican informal sugarcane settlements that have long been safe zones for Haitian immigrants and Dominicans of Haitian descent.

But that is changing. Under pressure to meet a weekly deportation quota of 10,000, the Dominican Republic’s general directorate of migration (DGM) is now pushing into bateyes. Raids are increasing, and even people born in the Dominican Republic – with documents or not – are being rounded up and deported, flagrantly disregarding laws, according to human rights organisations.

Targeting Haitian immigrants became widespread during the second term of the Dominican president, Luis Abinader, whose government imposed the new quota in October 2024, when 15 measures to “combat illegal immigration and guarantee national sovereignty” were announced.

This intensified enforcement comes during a rise in nationalist sentiment. Most Dominicans – 59% – believe that immigration harms the country, well above the regional average for negative views towards migrants.

Haitians are a target even though they are one of the world’s populations most vulnerable to climate disasters – a major factor in their emigration, alongside poverty, urban violence and food insecurity.

During the first 20 years of this century, Haiti was one of the top three countries – after Puerto Rico and Myanmar – to be affected by extreme weather events, based on the Climate Risk Index.

The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, does not appear in the top 10.

Experts agree that environmental degradation, worsened by Haiti’s dwindling 3% tree cover, has led to widespread displacement. By February 2025, violence and climate-related disasters had displaced more than 1 million people – about 10% of the population.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the climate crisis is a crucial driver of forced migration, with more than a quarter of displaced households in Haiti forced to move multiple times, largely due to hurricanes, floods and landslides.

The bateyes started as simple settlements on sugarcane plantations and are among the most marginalised and impoverished communities in the Dominican Republic. As the workers’ families expanded, they evolved into multigenerational communities.

While private bateyes, such as Construcción, still follow strict residency rules limiting housing to workers and their families, many public bateyes have become functioning neighbourhoods, blending into nearby towns and cities.

In Monte Coca, a public batey, Miranda scoops rice into bowls for each family member. The room is dark, with light streaming in from an opening in the wall as she cooks over a charcoal stove, sweating in the 30C (86F) heat. Each bowl has its owner, but in the last month she has had to set three aside, praying her sons and nephew return.

“I felt like part of my heart was torn away,” says Miranda, standing where she was when she was told they had been detained. “I wanted to go look for my son but I couldn’t,” she says, “because if I had gone, they would have taken me too.”

Although Miranda, her sons and nephew were all born in the Dominican Republic, none are recognised as citizens by the state. Their lack of documentation stems from nationality laws that have long excluded Dominicans of Haitian descent.

Deportation figures from the DGM do not match those of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) because many Haitians are victims of a racket in which people are detained by corrupt officials whom family members must then pay to get their relatives freed.

The problem is not new and has been acknowledged by Abinader, who says his government is working to combat it. From January to June, the DGM recorded more than 184,000 deportations – 56,000 more than were reported by the IOM. The difference is the number of multiple arrests of the same person.

“The issue is that people are not being counted, events are being counted,” says Bridget Wooding, director of the Caribbean Migrants Observatory (Obmica), a research centre studying migration dynamics in the region based in the Dominican Republic’s capital, Santo Domingo. “You can have the same person detained and deported several times.”

Miranda’s family were victims of the scam. Her husband, along with Carlo, a Monte Coca community leader, had to race to raise the money before his boys were deported. They got enough money together with the community’s help but, when they sent it, the agents blocked Carlo’s number. At four o’clock the next morning, the boys were loaded back on to the truck, this time bound for the border.

Instead of finding a lawyer, the family paid the buscones, as the scammers are known, a second time and the boys were returned home after four days in Haiti. Yet within the month, as Miranda’s sons sat outside with their cousin, her youngest was caught again.

“The first time, it felt like my soul left me. The second, I didn’t know what to do,” says Miranda.

“It’s like a business. If you have money, you don’t go to Haiti. But it has become more aggressive and more abusive,” adds Carlo.

The practice of targeting Haitians has been condemned by human rights defenders. Gabrielle Apollon, director of the Haiti Project at New York University’s Global Justice Clinic, denounces the intentional secrecy behind the detentions and deportations.

“People are rounded up in these cage-like deportation trucks and shipped off to Haiti as quickly as they can be. Nobody has any recourse [to the law],” she says. “How are you going to find a lawyer if you can’t even contact a parent to get you any access?”

The government spells out the rules and rights around deportations but in practice, laws are broken and human rights are disregarded, campaigners say. “The Dominican Republic is violating its own legislation,” says Wooding. “Virtually anybody in uniform may take matters into their own hands and participate in these activities.”

The Dominican Republic’s general directorate of migration was approached for comment.

Yet within the batey communities of San Pedro and Hato Mayor, it is common knowledge that migration does not respect individuals’ dignity or fundamental human rights.

Many communities in this region have a leader of sorts, who tries to help meet the community’s needs. The job now carries the new weight of navigating the increased number of immigration cases. And while deportations within the bateyes were almost unheard of before the quota, now every community faces a very real fear.

“They’re going into people’s homes,” says Fidel Herredia, a community leader who can recount numerous instances of migration officers carrying out night-time raids in his batey of Alejandro Bass.

“They come in [the house] like – ‘Hello, hello! Who’s there?! Haitian!’ Boom!” Herredia yells. “They throw you in the truck and take you away like you’re an animal.”

Jon Valdez, a migrant who has spent 46 years working the fields, is wary about what lies ahead for Haitians. But after decades in these sugarcane communities, he is confident about their strength in adversity.

“They think we are alone,” says Valdez. “But we are not alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a39e476ec61044525d21fc777dc029be70f33c/310_0_2051_1641/master/2051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0fca2b953c08fe05399bcb6c76500212",N,,2025-09-07 07:56:30.035769

UK politics live: Asylum seekers to be moved from hotels to barracks as Starmer toughens immigration plans

A government source said “nothing is off the table” for the new home secretary Shabana Mahmood

The new home secretary is expected to unveil plans to move asylum seekers from hotels into military barracks as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to harden his immigration policy amid rising numbers of crossings in the Channel.

Shabana Mahmood is reportedly set to announce the use of Ministry of Defence sites to house people after a wave of protests outside migrant accommodation over the summer.

The defence secretary John Healey confirmed to Sky News that he has placed military planners into the Home Office to scout out military facilities, after an estimated 1,000 people arrived in the UK by small boat over the course of Saturday.

It comes after the prime minister continued his major reshuffle of his top team and junior ministers.

The prime minister sacked Rachel Reeves’s sister from the Cabinet and farming minister Daniel Zeichner, while Jason Stockwood, who had a senior role at dating site Match.com, has been appointed to the Department of Business and Trade.

It comes as his chief secretary Darren Jones denied that Labour were in crisis, and rebuffed Nigel Farage’s prediction that there would be a general election in 2027.

Starmer moved quickly to appoint David Lammy deputy prime minister while Yvette Cooper has been moved from home secretary to take up a new role as foreign secretary, with justice secretary Shabana Mahmood replacing her at the Home Office.

Reform UK's Zia Yusuf denies claim migrants would be housed in shipping containers

Reform UK’s head of policy has denied claims that migrants will be housed in shipping containers, insisting the party would use “purpose-built modular steel structures”.

Speaking on Sky News, Zia Yusuf defended proposals for rapid-build detention facilities, citing international examples.

“We can look around the world at where things have worked and worked well,” he said.

“President Trump stood up 3,000 detention beds in eight days. That was this year in the state of Florida – using steel modular structures.”

When presenter Trevor Phillips asked: “Shipping containers?”, Mr Yusuf replied: “They’re not shipping containers, they’re purpose-built modular steel structures.”

Defence secretary disputes claim that Angela Rayner was treated unfairly

John Healey said “any government is stronger with Angela Rayner” but she is “not a victim”.

He rejected suggestions by Labour Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham that she had been treated unfairly.

After being shown a clip of Mr Burnham’s remarks, he said: “I dispute that. Our focus has been on the public that elected us, the delivery that we’re charged to change their lives. It’s a big part of the job we all do.

“Our Government will miss Angela Rayner. She’s not been a victim. She’s been under a lot of pressure and Andy Burnham’s right about that.

“But she’s been an inspiration to many, particularly working-class women.

“She’s been a very effective minister leading the overhaul… of employment rights… and also starting planning reform that will lead to us building a lot more homes.

“Any government is stronger with Angela Rayner but we’ve got a good new team in place and that’s our job.”

Starmer shouldn’t punish winter fuel rebels, Andy Burnham says

Andy Burnham has called for the Labour deputy leadership contest to be used as a discussion about the management of the Labour Party.

The Greater Manchester mayor said “it is right to have a discussion about the internal management of the Labour Party”.

In a warning to Sir Keir Starmer, he said: “Labour MPs need to be they need to listen to them more and respect them more.

“They were the ones who caused the change in terms of winter fuel and disability benefits, but they shouldn't be punished for that.

“I see good people, good MPs, losing the whip, people like Rachel Maskell, that doesn't seem fair to me. It didn't happen in the governments I was in, in Gordon Brown's government or Tony Blair's government.”

Angela Rayner resignation is a 'loss' for Labour government, Healey says

John Healey said Angela Rayner would be a “loss” to Government but did not say whether there would be any changes to Labour’s flagship workers’ rights Bill following her resignation.

Asked whether the sacking of employment rights minister Justin Madders and the departure of Ms Rayner meant the legislation would be watered down, the Defence Secretary said: “No, I think the plan to upgrade what will be the biggest upgrade in workers’ rights for a generation, led by Angela Rayner as one of the marks of how effective she’s been as minister and what a loss she’ll be to Government.”

Asked whether that meant people could expect no changes to the legislation, he said: “I’m really confident that we’ll deliver what we promised in the manifesto, the biggest upgrade of workers’ rights for a generation.

“The Bill’s been set out.”

He said the new team would take up the work already done by Ms Rayner and Mr Madders.

He told Sky News: “With the home office, I have been putting military planners into their border command and into their planning for the future, and we are looking at the potential use of military and non military use sites for temporary accommodation for the people who come across these small boats that may not have a right to be here or need to be processed rapidly before we can decide whether or not they should stay or whether or not we deport them.”

Thursday’s operation was the biggest immigration raid ever carried out at a single site during the second Trump administration, which began in January.
After obtaining the personal information of the workers, the investigators reportedly issued temporary permits only to those whose legal status had been verified, allowing them to exit the premises, while others were transported to an immigration detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.
US immigration officials said that was the central issue in the raid.
Construction of the plant began in the second half of 2023, as most processes have now entered their final stages.","Concerns in Seoul over a massive immigration raid in Georgia that led to the detention of hundreds of Korean workers eased Sunday afternoon, after a senior presidential official announced that negotiations with Washington had concluded.

Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff to President Lee Jae Myung, said a chartered flight was being prepared to bring the workers home upon the completion of additional administrative procedures.

Though updates on exactly when the detainees would be released had not been made available as of press time, The Korea Herald has compiled key information about the Trump administration's largest single-site immigration crackdown to date, conducted at the electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture of Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Energy Solution.

Thursday’s operation was the biggest immigration raid ever carried out at a single site during the second Trump administration, which began in January.

After blocking major roads leading to the plant, some 500 investigators from different US government agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, reportedly raided the site, deploying helicopters and military vehicles.

The investigators detained all the construction workers at the site to verify whether they were legally residing in the United States.

After obtaining the personal information of the workers, the investigators reportedly issued temporary permits only to those whose legal status had been verified, allowing them to exit the premises, while others were transported to an immigration detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.

Arrested workers were mostly put on a bus with their hands bound by cable ties, while some had chains around both their legs and wrists.

According to US authorities, a total of 475 people were arrested in the operation.

LG Energy Solution confirmed Sunday that 47 of its employees — 46 Koreans and one Indonesian — were taken into custody. Almost 250 personnel working for the affiliated HL-GA Battery, mostly Koreans, were detained by US authorities.

Many of those reportedly entered the US using B1 visas — issued for business purposes, such as attending meetings or signing contracts — or through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization visa waiver program for short-term stays. US immigration officials said that was the central issue in the raid.

Foreign nationals must acquire an appropriate visa such as the H-1B, L1 or E2 to legally obtain employment at workplaces located in the US. But as those visas can take months to obtain and their numbers are capped, they are often deemed impractical for companies that need to dispatch workers frequently or on short notice. Industry officials also complain that wait times for all types of visas have lengthened since the start of the Trump administration.

According to Korean media reports, the US allocates annual H-1B visa quotas to certain countries with which it has free trade agreements, including Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Chile and Australia. Despite having a free trade agreement with the US, South Korea does not receive a quota.

In response to the concern, an official from Seoul’s Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity, noted that H-1B visas are distributed through a lottery. The official said that the ministry has repeatedly urged the US government and Congress since 2012 to create a separate visa quota for Korean professionals, such as via the proposed Partner With Korea Act.

The most recent version of the bill, which would allow the establishment of a new E-4 visa for up to 15,000 Korean nationals per year to be employed in specialty occupations, was also initiated by Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Republican Rep. Young Kim — both of California — on July 23.

The E-4 visas would be valid for a maximum of two years and renewable indefinitely, according to the official. They are not to be linked to permanent residency eligibility.

Meanwhile, the ministry official explained that US authorities reviewed whether the activities of detained workers holding B-1 visas were consistent with the purpose of stay permitted under their visas.

The B-1 visa may be used by workers for purposes including staff training or the installation, operation or maintenance of machinery or equipment. But actual construction work is not permitted, and wages may not be paid by a US-based entity.

The Korean workers are being held at the Folkston ICE Processing Center in southern Georgia, where immigration authorities hold foreign nationals after arrest to review their immigration status and charges against them and to determine further action, including possible deportation.

The facility had been flagged for poor conditions after an inspection was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2021.

According to the DHS report, “Violation of ICE Detention Standards at Folkston ICE Processing Center and Folkston Annex,” Folkston facilities were unsanitary and dilapidated, with torn mattresses, water leaks, mold growth and water damage, rundown showers, mold and debris in the ventilation system, insect infestations, inoperable toilets, the absence of hot meals and other violations.

The inspectors added that the facility’s medical staff did not provide timely access to specialized care or adequate mental health treatment for detainees.

The Office of Inspector General reportedly determined that ICE had accepted most of its recommended improvements.

But human rights organizations in the US have continued to raise concerns over conditions in the detention center after the death of an Indian national, who had been detained there in April 2024.

In 2023, Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Energy Solution agreed to establish a North American joint venture, HL-GA Battery Co., investing $4.3 billion to build a factory capable of producing about 30 gigawatt-hours of battery cells annually — enough to supply roughly 300,000 electric vehicles.

The factory is located at the Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America site in Georgia, a major hub for Korean industry in the US that hosts more than 100 Korean companies, including Samsung, Hyundai Motor and LG, symbolizing the Korea-US manufacturing alliance.

Construction of the plant began in the second half of 2023, as most processes have now entered their final stages.

However, construction has been fully suspended following Thursday's immigration crackdown.

Seoul said it was told by Washington that the operation was carried out under a court-issued warrant to crack down on illegal employment and prevent the exploitation of undocumented workers.

But the Foreign Ministry said Seoul maintains the position that law enforcement in the US should not unfairly undermine the business activities of Korean investors or the rights of Korean nationals.

Standing along sidewalks in front of a Jewel-Osco store at Main Street and Geneva Road, they held signs, rang bells, drummed and chanted.

“ICE out of Wheaton! We are all Wheaton,” cried Cristobal Cavazos of Casa DuPage Workers Center, rallying the crowd of mostly white, middle-aged and older people, which was the point. “He (President Donald Trump) did not take into account his base of older, white Americans would fight back.”

Similar protests were held in Chicago and some other suburbs Friday and Saturday, ahead of an expected surge in ICE operations this weekend.

Officials in Mundelein, Highland Park, North Chicago, Waukegan and other suburbs have issued statements emphasizing their law enforcement officers won’t participate in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities and that their communities are safe for all, including immigrants.

Organizers of the Wheaton protest chose the Jewel-Osco site because an immigrant man was arrested in the store’s parking lot Aug. 1.

Cavazos said the man was at the store to pick up relatives who were cleaning the store.

“We saw what ICE terrorism is doing to what the Bible says are ‘the least of these,’” said Cavazos, adding janitors, restaurant workers and other laborers are targeted.

Some marched to and from a nearby Home Depot store. Organizers said Home Depots nationwide cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Undocumented immigrants have been known to congregate in Home Depot lots, where people hire them for day jobs. Home Depot denies the claim.

Penny Ellsworth of Glen Ellyn was at the protest with friend Jana Cronin of Wheaton.

“Yes, I am an outlier,” said Cronin when asked if she was related to the Republican Cronins of DuPage County, which include a former county board chairman.

Ellsworth and Cronin said they didn’t protest much when they were younger. Ellsworth attended an anti-Vietnam War protest, and Cronin said she protested the Iraq War.

“Once Trump got reelected, that did it,” Ellsworth said. “We just cannot sit still.”

The women have taken to visiting courthouses and restaurants, car washes and other businesses where some immigrants, documented or otherwise, are likely to be. They hand out cards listing the rights people have if they are picked up by ICE.

Plenty of drivers honked their horns in support, including a man driving a Jewel-Osco semitrailer to the store. He also gave a thumbs-up.

Or national sales taxes could be set slightly higher for imports.","Unless the Supreme Court rules otherwise, President Trump will soon require approval from Congress to keep in place the broad-based tariffs he has imposed, altering the nation’s social contract and increasing economic inequality.

Trump and his Cabinet have boasted that tariffs, now averaging almost 20 percent, will bring in tens or even hundreds of billions annually in new revenue into federal coffers. Alongside this narrative, administration officials claim that the tariff revenue can replace income taxes to fund government operations and pay interest on the national debt.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals underscored just before Labor Day that tariffs are taxes — and that only Congress has the power to raise taxes.

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act upon which Trump hinges most of his tariffs does not authorize the president to impose tariffs or any other tax, the court ruled. Trump’s unconstitutional use of these emergency powers is particularly poignant because his tariffs, which are expected to raise as much as $3.3 trillion over 10 years, affect a major part of the U.S. economy.

For most of our country’s early history, tariffs served as the federal government’s primary source of revenue. Congress set tariffs, not the president; income and other taxes were later added to cover the cost of major wars and expanding government services. “In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,” according to the majority opinion, “Congress began to delegate to the Executive limited authority to ‘activate or suspend’ tariff rates through international agreements,” as the U.S. became more engaged in global affairs.

Today, in their 7-4 ruling, the judges join a growing number of economists and business analysts who conceptualize tariffs as sales taxes passed along to the citizenry in the form of higher prices. This year’s historic spike in tariffs — coupled with the tax cuts just made permanent by Congress — make the U.S. tax system more regressive by shifting the tax burden toward the lower-income end of the scale.

“Heavy reliance on sales and excise taxes makes tax systems more regressive,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy states in its annual Who Pays? report. “A progressive, graduated rate income tax makes overall tax systems less regressive or more progressive.”

Federal tax policy analysts measuring the effects of suddenly higher and fast-changing tariffs are in a whole new territory. But they can look to states’ experience in weighing the impact and fairness of a variety of taxes, including those on sales, income and property.

At the state level, a proposal to impose a 20 percent sales tax and flatter income tax, as Trump and Congress have essentially just done, would be decried as unfair, because the burden would fall disproportionately on people with lower incomes.

By affirming the appeals court decision, the Supreme Court could provide an off-ramp with political cover for Trump’s administration to back away from tariffs increasingly perceived as harmful to Trump’s working-class base — and bring back the Constitution’s intent that lawmakers control the power of the purse.

To control the national debt, for example, Congress could replace Trump’s jumbled high tariffs with a smaller national sales tax covering both foreign and domestic products. It could also impose a value added tax, as many other countries do. Or national sales taxes could be set slightly higher for imports.

The important thing is that Congress needs to act — and a ruling to that effect could be a win-win if it preserves the separation of powers and gives Trump an escape route from a misguided tariff scheme.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/656abe2a76ce44.73019614.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-07 08:57:12.116415

Thursday’s arrest of some 475 workers – more than 300 of them South Korean nationals – at the plant near Savannah in the southern US state of Georgia was the largest single-site enforcement operation carried out by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an arm of the US Department of Homeland Security.

South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun on Saturday said President Lee has instructed officials to swiftly resolve the matter, stressing that the rights and interests of South Korean nationals and the business operations of South Korean companies investing in the US “must not be infringed upon”, South Korea’s official Yonhap news agency said in a report.

Cho said the government has set up a team to respond to the arrest of more than 300 Koreans at the facility, under construction in the southern state of Georgia, and that he may go to Washington, DC, to meet with officials if needed.

“We are deeply concerned and feel a heavy sense of responsibility over the arrests of our nationals,” Cho was quoted by Yonhap before an emergency meeting on Saturday to tackle the incident.

“We will discuss sending a senior Foreign Ministry official to the site without delay, and, if necessary, I will personally travel to Washington to hold consultations with the US administration,” he said.

The plant where the raid took place – part of US President Donald Trump’s escalating immigration crackdown – is intended to supply batteries for electric vehicles.

Responding to a reporter’s question about the immigration raid, Trump on Friday remarked during an event at the White House, “I would say that they were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job.”

Steven Schrank, an ICE official, justified the detentions, saying some of those detained had illegally crossed the US border, others arrived with visas that prohibited them from working, and some overstayed their work visas.

South Korea’s opposition People Power Party (PPP) reacted angrily to the detentions, warning they “could pose a serious risk” to the country.

“This is a grave matter that could lead to broader repercussions for Korean companies and communities across the United States,” PPP chairman Jang Dong-hyeok said in a statement.

Senior PPP spokesperson Park Sung-hoon blamed Lee for the incident, saying his “pragmatic diplomacy” towards the US “failed to ensure both the safety of citizens and the competitiveness” of South Korean businesses.

He said Lee’s government even promised at least $50bn of investments during his recent meeting with Trump, a gesture that only resulted in a “crackdown” against South Korean citizens.

In a statement, Hyundai said it was “closely monitoring” the situation, adding that none of those detained “is directly employed” with the company.

LG Energy Solution said it was “gathering all relevant details”, adding it “will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities”.

As part of the original preliminary injunction, Border Patrol agents were required to provide the ACLU with documentation on their specific and individual reasonable suspicion for each warrantless stop.
How the Border Patrol justified arrests The ACLU also says that Border Patrol’s official documentation of the raid, required by the court order, is riddled with other factual errors and boilerplate language.
During discovery, Border Patrol gave the ACLU 11 such arrest reports for the Sacramento raid.
Border Patrol would not provide reports for individuals who were detained but then released, the motion states.","The ACLU and United Farm Workers have filed a motion alleging that the Border Patrol violated a court order intended to curb racial profiling and unlawful, warrantless arrests in the Central Valley.

They want the judge to require new training and forbid agents involved in a July raid in Sacramento from participating in other operations until they are retrained.

In April, a federal district court judge ruled that the Border Patrol likely violated the Constitution’s protections against unreasonable search and seizure during a January operation in Kern County called “Operation Return to Sender,” in which agents swarmed a Home Depot and Latino market, among other areas frequented by laborers. The judge ordered the Border Patrol, led by El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, to stop the raids in California’s Eastern District, which covers much of the state’s Central Valley, including Sacramento.

Bovino in June took his agents to Los Angeles, where they spent weeks aggressively pursuing Latino-looking workers outside of Home Depots, car washes, bus stops and other areas. The agents often wore masks and used unmarked vehicles.

After a federal district court judge temporarily barred agents from conducting raids in the Los Angeles area, Bovino briefly moved north to Sacramento in July, detaining Latino day laborers in a Home Depot parking lot.

In an interview near the parking lot with Fox News, Bovino indicated at the time that his operations were ramping up, not slowing down. “There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said.

“We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”

Bovino told Fox the raids were targeted and based on intel.

“Everything we do is targeted,” he said. “We did have prior intelligence that there were targets that we were interested in and around that Home Depot, as well as other targeted enforcement packages in and around the Sacramento area.”

In a motion filed last week, the ACLU and the United Farm Workers asked the federal district court to enforce the preliminary injunction issued in April that barred Border Patrol agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion and from making warrantless arrests without assessing flight risk.

If granted, the motion could potentially bar Bovino from planning or participating in new raids in the Eastern District. Bovino appears to be moving on regardless: He announced Tuesday on his social media account that the L.A. crackdown would be expanding to other cities across the country.

A Border Patrol spokesman did not return a request for comment about the ACLU and UFW’s motion.

If the plaintiffs in the Kern County case are successful in getting a judge to strengthen or enforce the original injunction, the case could have nationwide implications, providing a legal strategy that could be replicated in communities where agents are using similar tactics. In Los Angeles and Southern California, agents have continued high-profile raids and violent tactics, despite a similar but separate temporary restraining order in the Central District, barring similar activity there.

As part of the original preliminary injunction, Border Patrol agents were required to provide the ACLU with documentation on their specific and individual reasonable suspicion for each warrantless stop.

The plaintiffs allege agents fabricated and copied and pasted boilerplate language for those reports from the raid at the Home Depot in south Sacramento.

According to the filing, dozens of armed and masked agents from the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies corralled people in the parking lot in Sacramento, ordering them not to move while demanding to see their papers.

Witnesses described unmarked Chevy trucks, agents dressed “like soldiers,” and people being grabbed and handcuffed with no explanation. At least one U.S. citizen was chased and detained during the operation, but Border Patrol won’t release that arrest report to the ACLU because the agency said it was unrelated to an immigration violation, according to the court documents. The agency told the media that the man slashed one of their tires in the parking lot.

Student detained near Home Depot sweep

Agents also tackled and arrested an 18-year-old high school student who happened to be walking to a nearby Ross, according to the ACLU and UFW’s motion.

Selvin Osbeli Mejia Diaz, a senior at Valley High School, fled violence in Central America last year and came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor. He lives with his aunt in Sacramento and is complying with the orders in his immigration court case seeking asylum, according to the ACLU and UFW motion.

According to his declaration, he was walking to the store to buy a shirt when an unmarked Chevy pulled up behind him. A masked agent burst out from the vehicle, tackled him to the ground, and handcuffed him without asking any questions, according to Mejia Diaz’s declaration.

“Everything happened very fast, and I felt very afraid because I did not know who the man was,” Mejia Diaz wrote in his declaration. “He was much taller than me and he used a lot of force, and he immediately handcuffed me while I was on the ground … I think they saw me and figured they could arrest me because I looked Latino.”

Mejia Diaz was born in Guatemala and turned himself in to border agents in June 2024 after crossing the U.S. border. After the Home Depot raid, he was taken to a detention center in downtown Sacramento, where he had to sleep on a hard ceramic floor with an aluminum blanket. He said he was detained for several days before he was allowed to call his aunt for a couple of minutes.

He is still being detained in the Imperial Regional Detention Facility.

The Border Patrol’s arrest report for Mejia Diaz incorrectly states he was in the Home Depot parking lot, the ACLU alleges, which they say supports their assertion that agents are using “copy and pasted” language for each arrest report.

How the Border Patrol justified arrests

The ACLU also says that Border Patrol’s official documentation of the raid, required by the court order, is riddled with other factual errors and boilerplate language.

The forms, known as Form I-213s, are meant to document agents’ reasonable suspicions for each warrantless stop they make. During discovery, Border Patrol gave the ACLU 11 such arrest reports for the Sacramento raid. Three of them included “X” placeholders instead of specific information about locations or names or details for the arrests.

Nearly every report used identical language, claiming people “fled from agents” as a factor in the agents’ reasonable suspicion. Several witnesses told the ACLU some people did not run, according to the motion. The plaintiffs also argue that running from masked, armed men who do not identify themselves should not be enough for reasonable suspicion.

A handful of the reports justified the warrantless arrests by stating: “Sacramento, California has been identified as a city where many illegal aliens are known to stay, live and work without having any legal documentation in the United States.” Others noted that California is a sanctuary state.

“(Person) was located in California, which is a sanctuary state. Sanctuary states shield the identity of illegal aliens from immigration officials,” the arrest reports noted. The plaintiffs argue that someone being in a sanctuary state is not enough cause to give an agent reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally.

California’s sanctuary law curbs local law enforcement cooperation with immigration authorities and prevents the automatic transfer of people to federal immigration custody, except for people who have been convicted of serious or violent felonies.

Border Patrol would not provide reports for individuals who were detained but then released, the motion states. The ACLU is asking the judge to shorten the amount of time Border Patrol has to share the arrest reports from seven days to four days because many of the people detained in the Sacramento raid had already been deported by the time they got the arrest reports, according to their motion.

A hearing on the motion to enforce the injunction is set for October in Fresno.

The group said it had information proving plans to do so are quietly in the works.

The Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (FIRRP), an Arizona-based organization, added Honduran children to an already-existing lawsuit on Friday.

The original lawsuit led to a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of Guatemalan children last weekend.

In a statement, the FIRRP said it received reports that the U.S. government will have plans to “illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

This lawsuit comes after a chaotic Labor Day weekend, halting the U.S. government from . The children had come to the U.S. alone, living in shelters or with foster care families in the country.

Advocates representing migrant children across the country filed lawsuits to stop the government from removing them. On Sunday, a federal judge ordered that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

According to a filing by the Department of Justice on Saturday, the U.S. government initially identified 457 Guatemalan children for possible deportation. None of the 457 children could have a pending asylum screening or claim, as they had to have parents or legal in Guatemala and be at least 10 years of age.

This resulted in the removal of 91 children.

327 children were found eligible for deportation, including the 76 children who boarded the planes early Sunday. The government described this as a first phase, according to a statement by Angie Salazar, the acting director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

All 76 children on the plane were at least 14 years old, and “self-reported” to authorities, telling them that they had a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala but none in the U.S.

Children who cross the Southern Border without any parents or guardians are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Department of Health and Human Services.

The children typically reside in shelters across the country, which the resettlement office oversees, until they are eventually released to a sponsor. The sponsor is usually a relative.

Children began crossing the border in large numbers alone, without guardians or parents, in 2014. In the 2022 fiscal year, the number of children crossing the border alone peaked at 152,060, according to the Associated Press.

Lawyers representing the Justice Department said federal law allows the Department of Health and Human Services to “repatriate” or “reunite” children through taking the children out of the country.

The lawyers noted that if the child hasn’t been a victim of “severe” human trafficking, is not at risk if he or she is returned to their native country and does not face a “credible fear” of persecution there, they can be sent to their native country.

The child also cannot be “repatriated” if they have a pending asylum claim.

Friday’s FIRRP lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras. The children have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras. Some of the children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands the government allow the children to present their cases to an immigration judge, provide them with access to legal counsel and place them in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.",https://katu.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/center/90/d83b99b1-e5bb-4398-8480-9ec2628a0b5c-cgs_government_department_of_justice_logo_building_ic.png,N,,2025-09-07 01:56:38.295219

“For us, our Independence Day has always been a celebration of our culture,” he said.","CHICAGO (AP) — President Donald Trump’s plan to dispatch National Guard troops and immigration agents into Chicago has put many Latino residents on edge, prompting some to carry their U.S. passports while giving others pause about openly celebrating the upcoming Mexican Independence Day.

Though the holiday falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants. Festivities kicked off with a Saturday parade through the heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood and will continue with car caravans and lively street parties.

But this year, the typically joyful period coincides with Trump’s threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he has targeted for expanded federal enforcement.

His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, as it did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital.

Trump posted an illustration of himself against a Chicago-skyline ablaze with flames and helicopters on Truth Social on Saturday.

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” he posted, along with “I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” referencing a 1979 war film. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to be renamed the Department of War.

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on the social platform X. “Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Although details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, there’s already widespread opposition as protesters marched through downtown on Saturday evening. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.

Mixed feelings about postponing festivities

The extended Mexican Independence Day celebrations reflect the size and vitality of Chicago’s Mexican American community. Mexicans make up more than one-fifth of the city’s total population and about 74% of its Latino residents, according to 2022 U.S. Census estimates.

Parade and festival organizers have been divided over whether to move forward with precautions or postpone, in hopes that it will feel safer for many participants to have a true celebration in several months’ time. El Grito Chicago, a downtown Mexican Independence Day festival set for next weekend, was postponed this week by organizers in order to protect people.

“But also we just refuse to let our festival be a pawn in this political game,” said Germán González, an organizer of El Grito Chicago.

In Pilsen and Little Village, two of the city’s best-known neighborhoods with restaurants, businesses and cultural ties to Mexican culture, residents expressed disappointment that the potential federal intervention instilled such fear and anxiety in the community at a time usually characterized by joy, togetherness and celebration of Mexican American heritage.

Celebrating, but with precautions

On Saturday morning, some parade-goers grabbed free, bright-orange whistles and flyers from volunteers standing outside the Lozano Branch of the Chicago Public Library. “Blow the whistle on ICE!” the flyers read, encouraging a nonviolent tactic to raise alarm if they saw agents.

Marchers held up cardboard signs painted with monarch butterflies, the migratory species that travels between the U.S. and Mexico. Many cheered “Viva Mexico!”

Drivers of vintage cars honked their horns and a drummer kept time for a group of dancers bedecked in feathers. Horseback riders clip-clopped down the street, and one lifted up a large Mexican flag.

Claudia Alvarez, whose 10-year-old daughter was nearby riding a pony, said it’s important that politicians see people out celebrating, though the crowd seemed smaller this year.

“At these hours you should be able to see plenty of people in the streets enjoying themselves, but now there’s not really a lot of people,” she said.

Fabio Fernandez, 39, owner of an art and T-shirt company with a residency at a Pilsen streetwear shop, called it “troubling” and “disheartening” that the possibility of federal intervention has impacted celebrations.

He said there’s a mood of anxiety in the neighborhood, which has translated to lower sales and reduced foot traffic for local businesses like his, Fernandez said.

“Come back to 18th Street. Support small businesses here. They’re still working hard as hell to keep their businesses alive,” he said.

Alejandro Vences, 30, became a U.S. citizen this year, “which gives me some comfort during this time,” he said while eating pozole verde at a local Mexican restaurant. Still, he said, the anxiety is palpable.

“For us, our Independence Day has always been a celebration of our culture,” he said. “It’s always been a celebration of who we are. It feels like we don’t get to celebrate our culture in the same way.”

Protest against ICE

A few miles away in downtown, more than a thousand protesters marched through the streets on Saturday evening with signs bearing slogans like “I.C.E. out of Illinois, I.C.E. out of everywhere.”

Speakers offered the crowd instructions on what to do if encountering Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. They also drew comparisons between the proposed ICE crackdown on Chicago and Israel’s presence in Gaza.

“We are inspired by the steadfastness of Palestinians in Gaza, and it is why we refuse to cower to Trump and his threats,” Nazek Sankari, co-chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, said to the crowd as many waved Palestinian flags and donned keffiyehs.

Viviana Barajas, leader with the community organization Palenque LSNA, promised that Chicagoans would “stand up” as Los Angeles had if Trump deploys the National Guard in their city.

“If he thinks these frivolous theatrics to undermine our sovereignty will shut out the passion we have for protecting our people, this is Chicago, and he is sorely mistaken,” Barajas said. “We have been studying LA and D.C., and they have stood up for their cities.”

In addition to Sanchez-Carrillo’s term of imprisonment, upon his release, he will be remanded to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation proceedings. The court also ordered the forfeiture of $7,750 in U.S. currency; a Smith and Wesson 9mm handgun; and associated ammunition.

According to court documents and admissions made at Sanchez-Carrillo’s change of plea and sentencing hearings, an investigation into the defendant began in March 2025 when a confidential informant purchased methamphetamine from Sanchez-Carrillo. On April 3, 2025, law enforcement executed search warrants on Sanchez-Carrillo’s apartment and his vehicle. During the search of his apartment, law enforcement recovered, 1,249 grams of fentanyl, 571 grams of heroin, 11,099 grams of methamphetamine, and 15 grams of cocaine, along with a Smith and Wesson 9mm handgun, and $7,750 in United States currency. Sanchez-Carrillo admitted that he knowingly possessed and intended to distribute the narcotics for profit and that he knew he was restricted from possessing the firearm, which affected interstate commerce because he was in the United States illegally.

Additionally, court documents reveal that Sanchez-Carrillo admitted that he entered the United States on or after December 14, 2023, and eluded examination and inspection by immigration officers until his apprehension on April 3, 2025. Sanchez-Carrillo also admitted that after being in the United States illegally for 30 days or longer, he deliberately failed to apply for registration. Court documents reveal that Sanchez-Carrillo had not applied for registration at the time he was found by immigration officers in Salt Lake County, Utah, and remains unregistered.

“Pumping poison in the form of illegal narcotics into our communities will not be taken lightly, said Acting U.S. Attorney Felice John Viti of the District of Utah. “Sanchez-Carrillo’s sentence sends a clear message to the defendant and others willing to break federal laws, that if you choose to engage in drug trafficking, illegally possess a firearm in the United States or unlawfully enter the United States you will face serious criminal consequences.”

“Individuals like Sanchez-Carrillo seek to profit while our communities are left to bear the cost of addiction, violence, and death,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls of the Salt Lake City FBI. “The FBI will relentlessly pursue and investigate drug traffickers who threaten public safety.”

“The sentencing of Sanchez-Carrillo sends a clear message to anyone involved in bringing drugs into our community: you will be caught, prosecuted, and held accountable,” said Lester R. Hayes, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, Las Vegas. “We’re proud of the hard work and strong teamwork of our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, who are committed to bringing criminals like Sanchez-Carrillo to justice.”

But it's not just in Australia where migration has created such deep feelings - it's also an issue that has been front and centre in the US as Donald Trump fulfils his election campaign promise to carry out mass deportations. There are now at least a million fewer immigrants in the US, raising questions about the impact of their absence on key industries like agriculture and construction. Migration is also a major concern in Europe, which has long grappled with what to do with the scores of people fleeing war and poverty in their home countries. This episode of the TOO HARD BASKET focuses on these complexities.

TRANSCRIPT

“From day one I will seal the borders, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens the hell back home.”

That's Donald Trump, speaking in the lead-up to the 2024 US election as part of a campaign characterised by regular rhetoric on immigration.

Since Trump's return to the White House, the news has been dominated by regular examples of the President making good on his promises to organise mass deportations.

But there have been widespread objections, with regular street protests and even supporters turning up where ICE teams are, trying to prevent arrests.

Yet ICE raids, deportations, and protests against them are not a new phenomenon.

While the Republican party has become known in recent years for its hardline policy stance, the beloved GOP President Ronald Reagan - in the eyes of some - never made immigration a central focus of his government.

He called for America to welcome those from overseas, eventually signing a bill that saw 2.7 million undocumented people granted permanent residence.

“This bill - the Immigration and Reform Control Act that I will sign in a moment - is the most comprehensive reform of our immigration system since 1952.”

By contrast, Democratic presidents have frequently talked tough on immigration, like Bill Clinton in his 1995 State of the Union address.

“All Americans are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.”

Another Democratic President, Barack Obama, became known for deporting an estimated 2.5 million from the US, more than any other previous administration.

As a result, in 2014 National Council of La Raza President Janet Murguía called him the 'deporter in chief', and ads were run ahead of his second election campaign like this one from Nevada conservative group, American Principles in Action.

""Don't be fooled by President Obama's words. He's not committed to immigrants. He only wants our vote.”

But some have argued there's a key difference between these previous governments and the Trump administration.

In 2024, Trump had promised to focus on what he called ""dangerous criminals"", a position he still maintains.

“We were inundated by millions of people, many millions of during the Biden administration. They say 21 million. And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers.”

Studies and reports suggest former Presidents also focussed on those convicted of crimes - and people recently caught crossing the border without authorisation.

But government figures released this year suggest a much wider net is now being cast by the present White House.

The figures indicate most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions - and are sometimes taken into custody as they have their regular check-ins with officials, part of the legal pathway to residency and citizenship.

Top White House official Stephen Miller has driven much of this activity, setting a quota for at least 3,000 arrests per day and telling ICE leadership they should target anyone without legal status.

“On a day to day basis, you're going to see exponentially larger numbers of illegal aliens being arrested and removed from the interior.”

Such moves have prompted concern that the pendulum has swung from legitimate immigration policy initiatives to politically-motivated responses, underpinned by long-held biases against immigrants.

Democratic Representative for the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, is among those to suggest Trump's recent order for National Guard troops and ICE agents to deploy to Washington DC is proof of his partisan motives and bias.

“No emergency exists in DC that the president did not create himself.”

But the US is not alone in taking a hardline approach to immigration policy.

Such stances have also grown in popularity in Europe as the continent grapples with the movement of millions fleeing war and poverty in their home countries.

Germany is one of the nations with the highest numbers of illegal entrants - but Greece and Italy are also among those countries on the front line, especially for boat arrivals.

Spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, Shabia Mantoo, had this to say in 2022.

“We do know that people are becoming increasingly desperate when there's an absence of pathways to safety, that they will continue to be exploited by unscrupulous smugglers and unfortunately will be risking their lives in these journeys.”

Eventually, in 2024, European M-Ps endorsed a new Pact on Migration and Asylum that required all E-U members to take some form of responsibilty for managing asylum applications.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen [[lion]] said it was the right way to go.

“Today we have voted in favour of a package that provides for a robust legislative framework that is the same in all member states, that puts humanity first, that understands all the different, difficult aspects of this issue.”

But it appears to have done little to appease the ongoing underlying tensions.

While human rights groups and some MPs believe it's too much, some conservative politicians want the rules to be even tougher - like Greece's far right group Voice of Reason leader,

""You have filled our countries with illegal migrants with the blessing of Germany and France. We pay Islam that hates us out of our savings to turn our cities into ghettoes, to rape and to murder before our eyes in the name of Allah. We are filled with Mohammed and Mahmoud in a Europe that has become unrecognisable.”

These tensions have played out in communities all over Europe, like Altena in Germany.

The town in the Lenne river valley made national headlines in 2015 when it volunteered to take in 100 more migrants than required as part of Germany's response to an influx of more than a million migrants into the country.

It was seen as a model of Chancellor Angela Merkel's pledge.

""Wir schaffen das ((We can do this)).”

Yet while Altena saw an opportunity to reverse years of population and economic decline, cracks started to show early on.

Shortly after the first arrivals in 2015, a local firefighter set a building housing refugees ablaze, and two years later, mayor Andreas Hollstein survived a knife attack by a man who said he'd been ignored and marginalised while hundreds of immigrants had been helped.

Hollstein says those were isolated incidents.

""We were in complete agreement as politicians. All the parties represented on the Altena city council were in agreement and still are today.”

Some of those who made their way to the town say they were warmly welcomed - and still are.

That includes former Syrian refugee Humam Algburi.

""This program was a success. The way they handled people, what they did. They also listened to us. Sometimes I had problems and I went to the city administration of Altena, A lady was there, who spoke Arabic. I explained the situation and then it was resolved. It was very, very good.”

But with more migrants arriving every year, the mood among some residents has started to noticeably sour - and today, some complain that the number of refugees and asylum seekers is getting too high.

So says Altena citizen Elke Randelhoff. ""Of course, there were many families who said yes, as Mrs. Merkel said, this culture of welcome, of taking someone in, inviting them to lunch, to a get-together, all of that happened. But among the majority of the population, acceptance was not so high, and it became less and less. Yes, unfortunately.”

These misgivings - alongside frustrations about rising living costs and strained public finances - have led to a rise in support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, not just in Altena but across the country.

In Poland, border measures to control so-called illegal immigration was a central issue in June's presidential election where nationalist conservative Karol Nawrocki - who wants the country to follow a path inspired by Trump - narrowly won.

""My program is: no to illegal migration; yes to the Polish złoty, no to the euro.”

Migration issues have also been at the forefront of politics in the UK, where promises to limit those coming in have been made on a regular basis - by different governments of different political persuasions.

The UK currently faces a record number of asylum claims and arrivals by migrants in small boats across the Channel, including more than 28,000 this year, and in recent weeks there have been sometimes ugly scenes at anti-immigration protests, as tensions boil over.

Some of the protesters have objected to the presence of asylum seekers who have been housed in UK hostels as they wait to have their cases determined.

UNNAMED MALE PROTESTER: ""They're really close to tipping point, this country. So many of us are struggling to pay for everything and working so they can lounge about in hotels.""

UNNAMED FEMALE PROTESTER: ""Honestly, get them one. It's not safe when they're here.”

Counter protesters say the migrants are being wrongly targeted.

COUNTER PROTESTER: ""It's just unfair the way that these people are being scapegoated. I understand the unrest, and there is a conversation to be had about how these are getting here, but it's not their fault.”

The public discontent has handed Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage's populist Reform UK party a consistent lead in opinion polls.

He has argued that illegal immigrants have more rights than local people - prompting the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to go even further and harder.

“Well, look, I understand why people want the hotels closed. I want them closed and I will work across the board to close them as quickly as possible. That is my aspiration.”

The Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, has criticised such responses - and the plans of Nigel Farage's party for mass deportation of asylum seekers.

He says more appropriate and long term solutions are required.

“You haven't solved the problem. You've just put it somewhere else and you've done nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country... We should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short-term, knee-jerk - you know, send them in this case, send them home.”

European Central Bank President Christine Legarde says the irony is that migrants have significantly boosted Europe's economy, in large part by filling labour shortages in an ageing population, and contributing to lower inflation.

The US example seems to be providing plenty of evidence in support of that position.

Immigrants make up almost 20 percent of the US workforce, and Dallas-based Federal Reserve Bank labor economist, Pia Orrenius, says immigrants normally contribute at least 50 percent of job growth in the U.S.

Yet a range of studies are suggesting such growth has slowed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August sharply revising down employment growth for May and June to the tune of 258,000 fewer jobs created.

The revision infuriated Trump, who sacked the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, accusing her - without evidence - of fudging the data.

“We'll be announcing a new statistician some time over the next three of four days. We had no confidence - I mean, the numbers were ridiculous which she announced. But that was just one negative number.”

Similar results however are emerging from different sources.

Preliminary analysis of Census data from the Pew Research Center has suggested more than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July.

That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

All of this is showing up in key industries like construction.

An Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data has found the number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas.

The association's chief economist Ken Simonson says there are many reasons for construction employment stalling and retreating - but that contractors would still hire more people if they could find them.

Arkansas-based general contractor supervisor Robby Robertson says it's not a job most people want to do.

“It's very hard these days to get people to do construction. It's extremely hard. And they are willing to do it, the Hispanic descent. They basically are stepping up and will do some of the hard work.”

The trouble is, Robby Robertson says, about half of his workers - scared by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on a job site in Florida 230 miles [[370 kilometres]] away - have left, and stayed gone.

“This particular job here is a huge job for the community. Well, the community is gonna miss out if we can't get it finished. And those raids happened a good bit away from here. There's a lot of closer jobs than this one. So I know they're all being affected as well.”

Immigrants make up almost 45 percent of the workforce in farming, fishing and forestry, too - and similar scenarios are playing out on farms across the country.

In McAllen, Texas, just across the border from Mexico, Elizabeth Rodriguez from the National Farmworker Ministry says there won't be enough workers to harvest the corn and cotton fields that are ready for picking.

She says the impact is going to affect the whole food chain - from field workers to truck drivers to people working in packing houses and in sales.

Farmer Greg Tesch says they're seeing that in Ventura County in California too.

“If things are ripe such as - our neighbours have bell peppers here. If they dont harvest within two or three days, and the crop is sunburnt or over mature or breaking a different colour or the market changes - so with the vegetable crops it's very critical. With the fruit crops it's critical but slightly less critical. But still we need the labour and we need the labour, or else we'll miss things. We'll fall behind.”

Greg Tesch says the quantity and timing of ICE raids are unsettling a lot of people.

“Nobody feels safe when they hear the word ICE - even the documented people. We know the neighbourhood is full of a combination of those with and without documents. And there's always a rumour. Even - a rumour can start and it will keep people home. So it affects everything that we do.”

But federal authorities remain undeterred, as White House Border czar Tom Homan has made clear.

“Yell and scream all you want. You're not going to stop ICE from doing our job.”",https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/c9b4e89/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1013+0+94/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2Fa5%2F3b4d4af64d7093b7713a3dc70d50%2Fa-man-is-detained-by-ice-agents-after-leaving-a-court-hearing-in-new-york-aap.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 00:56:31.089318

The protest began at 5 p.m. at the intersection of Ida B Wells Drive and Michigan Avenue near Grant Park.

“We cannot accept the divide and conquer rhetoric that calls our neighbors criminals, calls our siblings illegals,” Kobi Guillory, CAARPR Activist, said.

Thousands flocked to the area to condemn what they call a dangerous agenda by the Trump administration targeting immigrant communities under the false pretext of crime reduction.

“Terrorizing our communities by sticking the National Guard against its own people,” said Viviana Barajas of Palenque LSNA.

With reports of a potential federal intervention, safety marshals stayed alert along the march route.

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning..'” the president’s image post read. “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the department of war.”

In the photo, which appears to have been generated using artificial intelligence, the president can be seen sitting on a beach in Vietnam era military fatigues, with the Chicago skyline behind him as a fire burns to his left and a collection of military helicopters fly nearby.

Additionally, the image has the words “Chipocalypse Now” written on it.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson took to social media to respond to the president’s threat. He wrote:

“The President’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution. We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

The operation is expected to last several weeks, the New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter.
It was not immediately clear how many federal officers were involved in the crackdown, which comes as Chicago braces for a Trump administration ramp-up of deportations in the third-largest US city.

DHS and its US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm are calling the operation Patriot 2.0, modifying the name of a May deportation surge that led to the arrest of 1,500 people in the state, according to the reports.

A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The operation is expected to last several weeks, the New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter. One of the sources told the Times that Patriot 2.0 was focused on targeting immigrants who had been released from custody despite Ice agents attempting to pick them up from local jails.

It was not immediately clear how many federal officers were involved in the crackdown, which comes as Chicago braces for a Trump administration ramp-up of deportations in the third-largest US city.

NBC10 Boston quoted a statement from a DHS spokesperson as deriding the Boston mayor Michelle Wu’s so-called sanctuary policies.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,” the statement reported by NBC10 said.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration have been steadily building since March when Wu testified before Congress alongside three other Democratic mayors to defend their cities’ immigration policies – specifically so-called sanctuary city laws that limit state and local law enforcement cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Critics of these policies claim that sanctuary laws undermine federal law enforcement’s ability to arrest and deport individuals with criminal records.

As part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, it has pushed for mass deportations and targeted “sanctuary cities” in particular.

Wu has defended her city’s policies in a letter to US attorney general Pam Bondi: “The City of Boston is the safest major city in America,” she wrote. “Our progress is the result of decades of community policing and partnership between local law enforcement and community leaders, who share a commitment to making Boston a safe and welcoming home for everyone.”

In response, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons, said that the agency intended to “flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions”.

As the threat of federal actions looms, Wu said last week that her administration was actively preparing for the possibility of a federal national guard deployment.

Wu also said her administration was reviewing relevant legal precedents and working “very closely” with community members “to ensure people know what’s happening and that this is not something that is needed or wanted or legally sound”.

LG told The Associated Press that it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.
Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line.
The sprawling manufacturing site The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.
Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.","Hundreds of federal agents descended on a sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in Georgia and detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals.

This is the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site state officials have long called Georgia’s largest economic development project.

The detainment of South Korean nationals also sets it apart, as they are rarely caught up in immigration enforcement compared to other nationalities.

Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist. Others had plastic ties around their wrists as they boarded a Georgia inmate-transfer bus.

Here are some things to know about the raid and the people impacted:

The workers detained

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.

Some of them worked for the battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution that is slated to open next year, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site, according to Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations.

He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

But an immigration attorney representing two of the detained workers said his clients arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.

Attorney Charles Kuck said one of his clients has been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks, while the other has been in the country for about 45 days, adding that they had been planning to return home soon.

The detainees also included a lawful permanent resident who was kept in custody for having a prior record involving firearm and drug offenses, since committing a crime of “moral turpitude” can put their status in jeopardy, Lindsay Williams, a public affairs officer for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Saturday.

Williams denied reports that U.S. citizens had been detained at the site since “once citizens have identified themselves, we have no authority.”

Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday that none of its employees had been detained as far as it knew and that it is reviewing its practices to make sure suppliers and subcontractors follow U.S. employment laws. LG told The Associated Press that it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens and is sending diplomats to the site.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None of them have been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said, but the investigation is ongoing.

Family members and friends of the detainees were having a hard time locating them or figuring out how to get in touch with them, James Woo, communications director for the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said Saturday in an email.

Woo added that many of the families were in South Korea because many of the detainees were in the United States only for business purposes.

Raid is the result of a monthslong investigation

The raid was the result of a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site, Schrank said.

In a search warrant and related affidavits, agents sought everything from employment records for current and former workers and timecards to video and photos of workers.

Court records filed this week indicated that prosecutors do not know who hired what it called “hundreds of illegal aliens.” The identity of the “actual company or contractor hiring the illegal aliens is currently unknown,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote in a Thursday court filing.

The sprawling manufacturing site

The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.

Hyundai Motor Group started manufacturing EVs at the $7.6 billion plant a year ago. Today, the site employs about 1,200 people in a largely rural area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Savannah.

Agents specifically honed in on an adjacent plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county’s Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.

Raid was the ‘largest single site enforcement operation’

From farms and construction sites to restaurants and auto repair shops, there have been a wide array of workplace raids undertaken in this administration. But most have been smaller, including a raid the same day as the Georgia one in which federal officers took away dozens of workers from a snack-bar manufacturer in Cato, New York.

Other recent high-profile raids have included one in July targeting a legal marijuana farm northwest of Los Angeles. More than 360 people were arrested in one of the largest raids since Trump took office in January. Another one took place at an Omaha. Nebraska, meat production plant and involved dozens of workers being taken away.

Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The majority of the people detained are Koreans. During the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2024, only 46 Koreans were deported during out of more than 270,000 removals for all nationalities, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Community members and advocates have mixed reactions

Kemp and other Georgia Republican officials, who had courted Hyundai and celebrated the EV plant’s opening, issued statements Friday saying all employers in the state were expected to follow the law.

The nonprofit legal advocacy organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta described the raid in a joint statement as “unacceptable.”

“Our communities know the workers targeted at Hyundai are everyday people who are trying to feed their families, build stronger communities, and work toward a better future,” the statement said.

Sammie Rentz opened the Viet Huong Supermarket less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Hyundai site six months ago and said he worries business may not bounce back after falling off sharply since the raid.

“I’m concerned. Koreans are very proud people, and I bet they’re not appreciating what just happened. I’m worried about them cutting and running, or starting an exit strategy,” he said.

Ellabell resident Tanya Cox, who lives less than a mile from the Hyundai site, said she had no ill feelings toward Korean nationals or other immigrant workers at the site. But few neighbors were employed there, and she felt like more construction jobs at the battery plant should have gone to local residents.

“I don’t see how it’s brought a lot of jobs to our community or nearby communities,” Cox said.

As protestors marched through the streets of North Chicago, they expressed fear for the days and weeks ahead.

“I’m standing out here because a lot of people I know and love they’re too scared to be out here or they can’t be out here, so I decided to come out here and be the voice for them,” said Lina Alvarez from North Chicago.

Retired from the Army, Alvarez told NBC Chicago she was deployed four times and said this is not what she wanted to come home too.

“It hurts to see service members that I consider brothers and sisters weaponized against my community, people, who I love,” she said.

“I mean it’s heartbreaking it’s heartbreaking we’re all here trying to fight it off,” said Rosa Rivas, who lives in Waukegan. “Does he [Trump] seriously not have a heart?”

Another protester, Ellen Montogery of Waukegan, said called the president's plan to ramp-up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area ""illegal"" and ""unlawful.""

""These are my neighbors they’re after,” said Montgomery. “We have to take care of each other.""

The president caused a firestorm on social media Saturday morning, writing on Truth Social: “I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of War.”

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker fired back on X, writing in part, “The president of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also responded to Trump's post, writing on X, “The president’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break out constitution.”

ICE, as the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is known, is conducting a follow-up to a surge in May it's called Operation Patriot 2.0, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is a part of, told NBC10 Boston on Saturday.

The May operation, Operation Patriot, resulted in nearly 1,500 people being arrested, officials said at the time.

In the new statement, the DHS spokesperson, who didn't give their name, referred to the initial operation as a success, and derided the so-called sanctuary policy of Boston and its mayor, Michelle Wu, as privileging criminals over U.S. citizens.

""Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,"" the statement said.

Wu has reiterated that its policies on immigrants -- limiting local officials' cooperation with deportation enforcement -- have made it among the country's safest cities, including in her response to a federal lawsuit filed this week over Boston's ""sanctuary"" law, the Boston Trust Act.

Wu released a statement to NBC10 Boston on Saturday night addressing the latest operation in the area, saying, ""For months, the Trump DOJ, DHS, and ICE have been spreading blatant lies and threatening to 'bring hell' to cities like Boston who refuse to bow down to their authoritarian agenda, so this unconstitutional attack is not a surprise.""

""This country was born facing down bullies, with Bostonians leading the way,"" Wu continued. ""Today Boston is the safest major city in the country because we have worked to build trust in the community, so that everyone feels safe seeking help or reporting a crime. We will not be bullied or intimidated into abandoning the efforts that make Boston a safe home for everyone.”

It wasn't immediately clear how many federal agents were taking part in Operation Patriot 2.0, or what Massachusetts communities the operation was being conducted in. The New York Times, citing sources, reported that the operation was expected to last several weeks; the DHS spokesperson's statement didn't address how long Patriot 2.0 would take.

The group said it had information proving plans to do so are quietly in the works.

The Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (FIRRP), an Arizona-based organization, added Honduran children to an already-existing lawsuit on Friday.

The original lawsuit led to a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of Guatemalan children last weekend.

In a statement, the FIRRP said it received reports that the U.S. government will have plans to “illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

This lawsuit comes after a chaotic Labor Day weekend, halting the U.S. government from . The children had come to the U.S. alone, living in shelters or with foster care families in the country.

Advocates representing migrant children across the country filed lawsuits to stop the government from removing them. On Sunday, a federal judge ordered that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

According to a filing by the Department of Justice on Saturday, the U.S. government initially identified 457 Guatemalan children for possible deportation. None of the 457 children could have a pending asylum screening or claim, as they had to have parents or legal in Guatemala and be at least 10 years of age.

This resulted in the removal of 91 children.

327 children were found eligible for deportation, including the 76 children who boarded the planes early Sunday. The government described this as a first phase, according to a statement by Angie Salazar, the acting director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

All 76 children on the plane were at least 14 years old, and “self-reported” to authorities, telling them that they had a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala but none in the U.S.

Children who cross the Southern Border without any parents or guardians are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Department of Health and Human Services.

The children typically reside in shelters across the country, which the resettlement office oversees, until they are eventually released to a sponsor. The sponsor is usually a relative.

Children began crossing the border in large numbers alone, without guardians or parents, in 2014. In the 2022 fiscal year, the number of children crossing the border alone peaked at 152,060, according to the Associated Press.

Lawyers representing the Justice Department said federal law allows the Department of Health and Human Services to “repatriate” or “reunite” children through taking the children out of the country.

The lawyers noted that if the child hasn’t been a victim of “severe” human trafficking, is not at risk if he or she is returned to their native country and does not face a “credible fear” of persecution there, they can be sent to their native country.

The child also cannot be “repatriated” if they have a pending asylum claim.

Friday’s FIRRP lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras. The children have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras. Some of the children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands the government allow the children to present their cases to an immigration judge, provide them with access to legal counsel and place them in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.",https://komonews.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/center/90/d83b99b1-e5bb-4398-8480-9ec2628a0b5c-cgs_government_department_of_justice_logo_building_ic.png,N,,2025-09-06 22:56:53.039850

Immigration courts, which fall under the Justice Department rather than the judiciary, must now follow the board’s decision.
The policy, introduced in July, is being challenged in federal court.
Several lawsuits argue that prolonged detention without bond violates federal law and constitutional protections.","An immigration appellate board on Friday upheld a Trump administration policy that denies bond hearings to immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization, expanding mandatory detention to thousands already in custody and potentially millions more nationwide.

The policy is being challenged in federal court, but the Board of Immigration Appeals’ ruling is expected to quickly curb judges’ long practice of granting bond to immigrants not deemed flight risks or dangers.

The Los Angeles Times reported the ruling bars immigration judges from granting bond, requiring detainees to remain in custody through removal proceedings that can last years. Immigration courts, which fall under the Justice Department rather than the judiciary, must now follow the board’s decision.

The policy, introduced in July, is being challenged in federal court. Several lawsuits argue that prolonged detention without bond violates federal law and constitutional protections. A class-action case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

Supporters of the policy say it strengthens enforcement by preventing detainees from being released while their cases proceed. Critics, including immigrant rights attorneys, argue that the approach could increase detention significantly, strain detention facilities, and pressure individuals to abandon their cases.

The ruling stems from the case of a Venezuelan national who entered the United States near El Paso, Texas, in 2022 and was later granted Temporary Protected Status, which was terminated in April 2023 following an administration decision that remains under litigation. The board concluded that people who are illegally inside the U.S. must be detained through the entirety of their immigration proceedings.

The new determination effectively places long-term residents who entered the country illegally in the same category as those who more recently made an illegal border crossing. All are now subject to mandatory detention without the option of bond.

Trump administration targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states.

Immigrants’ Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.

“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

Although the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has accepted the audit office's recommendation for improvement, the environment of the facility is likely to have improved to some extent, local human rights groups have raised concerns since then.

Although the South Korean government is asking the U.S. for cooperation in resolving the situation and demanding prompt release, analysts say that prolonged detention could also raise concerns about deteriorating health.

On the 4th, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cracked down on illegal residents at a joint battery plant construction site between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution in Georgia. In the process, 475 people, including 300 Koreans, were reportedly arrested. Most of the South Koreans arrested are currently in a detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.

2021 Audit Office Points Out Leaks, Fungi, Worms, etc

The name of the detention facility is Processing Center. It is a place where ICE investigates the residence status and charges of arrested foreigners and detain them until they decide on a processing policy, including deportation.

In the past, the Folkston facility was pointed out for its poor environment during a random inspection by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) audit office.

According to the report released by the audit office in June 2022, the audit office identified a number of ""violations that undermine the health, safety and rights of prisoners"" in the inspection conducted from November 16-18, 2021.

The audit office pointed to ""torn mattresses, leaks, stagnant water, mold, old showers, mold and debris in ventilation systems, pervasive bugs, hot water-deficient showers, inoperable toilets, broken thermometers in kitchen freezers, and absence of warm meals.""

The audit office said, ""The medical staff at the facility did not provide special treatment or adequate mental health treatment for the inmate in a timely manner. Folkston did not respond in a timely or complete manner to the grievances or requests of the inmate,"" it said.

He also pointed out that he improperly handcuffed the inmate and did not properly manage the inmate's possessions.

Since then, the audit office has determined that ICE has mostly accepted the audit office's recommendations for improvement. As a result, the living environment of the facility seems to have improved to some extent, but local human rights organizations have raised concerns since then.

In 2024, there will be deaths of inmates

In April 2024, some pointed out that Jaspal Singh, an Indian national who was arrested while attempting to enter the country illegally, died after being imprisoned in Folkston, and that medical response may have been insufficient.

In a statement the day before, the Atlanta, Georgia-based human rights group Asian Americans for Justice (AAAJ) criticized ICE's crackdown on the construction site of the Hyundai Motor-LG Ensol plant, pointing out ""inhumane conditions and violations"" at the Folkston detention center.

The Folkestone Detention Center is owned and managed by private company GEO Group and has a capacity of about 1100.

ICE detention centers in the United States are generally known to have poor living conditions. According to a report released by the audit office in September 2024, the audit office surveyed 17 detention centers, including Folkston, between 2020 and 2023 and pointed out that they did not fully comply with DHS's own environmental health and safety standards.

Lawmakers and staffers had hoped to ask officials questions about the legal justification for the strike, and even get basic details like which military unit conducted the attack, what type of munition was used, and the kind of intelligence gathering that went into determining the identities and intentions of those on the boat.

Broadly, administration officials have sought to make the argument that the 11 people on a speedboat that the U.S. blew up in international waters in the Caribbean this week were legitimate military targets because they were members of a loosely organized Venezuelan criminal gang called Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization.

""The strike was the obvious result of designating them a terrorist organization,"" said one person familiar with the Pentagon's thinking. ""If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the U.S., would anyone even ask this question?""

But Congress in 2001 explicitly determined the U.S. to be at war with al Qaeda, officially stamping them as combatants who the U.S. is legally allowed to kill under both domestic and international law. It has not done so for Tren de Aragua.

The designation of the group as a foreign terrorist organization — or FTO — under U.S. statute gives the president the authority to impose financial and legal penalties, like sanctions, but it does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force.

The president has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to use military force when it is in the national interest, and when it does not amount to ""war"" in the constitutional sense, which requires an act of Congress.

Few details on the deceased

Even if the action taken against the 11 people in the boat did constitute a strike against a group with whom the U.S. was engaged in armed conflict, there are other legal questions and contradictions within the administration's public accounting of the episode.

Finucane and others pointed to Rubio's admission that the boat could have been interdicted rather than destroyed — as has been done in the past — but that the president ordered a lethal strike as a matter of first, not last, resort.

""That gives away the ballgame right there,"" said a former Pentagon lawyer who left the government in recent months. ""Any remotely plausible argument for inherent commander-in-chief authority to take military action would require showing there wasn't an alternative to lethal force.""

Trump, in his letter to Congress, also claimed that the administration acted in self-defense because of ""the inability or unwillingness of some states in the region to address the continuing threat to United States persons and interests emanating from their territories"" — language that echoes some key justifications for the use of force under international law.

But, the same former defense lawyer said, under the U.N. Charter establishing the international rules of war, to claim a defensive action, ""you have to establish it was necessary and proportionate.""

""If you're admitting you could have just interdicted, how was blowing up necessary?"" this person said.

And perhaps most importantly, experts and congressional aides said, the administration so far has provided few factual details about the 11 people on the boat that would support their assessment that they were a legitimate military target.

Rubio and Trump offered conflicting assessments of where the boat was heading — Rubio initially said the alleged drugs on board were ""probably"" bound for Trinidad or another Caribbean country, while Trump said the vessel was headed to the U.S. Rubio later said the U.S. had intelligence the vessel ""was headed towards, eventually, the United States.""

Although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that the government ""knew exactly who"" was on the boat and ""exactly what they were doing,"" and Trump has said the U.S. has ""tapes of them speaking,"" the government has not released the identities of any of the people killed.

The military and the CIA have been criticized in the past for killings of civilians whom they believed were terrorists.

International law prohibits the deliberate killing of civilians, even in the context of an armed conflict. Domestic law, meanwhile, prohibits unilateral and premeditated killings of non-military targets.

""There is a word for the premeditated killing for people outside of context of armed conflict,"" Finucane said. ""That word is murder. The administration has not made the case U.S. is in armed conflict with TDA or made the case that they are governed by the law of war.""

Trump’s post comes as he ramps up federal enforcement in Chicago and the city prepares for anticipated increased operations by ICE.","As crowds celebrated the Mexican Independence Day parade in Pilsen and the city prepares for ramped-up immigration enforcement, President Donald Trump threatened Chicago in a post on social media Saturday, saying the city was about to find out “why it’s called the Department of War.”

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,’” he posted on Truth Social, a reference to the 1979 Vietnam War movie “Apocalypse Now” where Robert Duvall’s character Lt. Col. Kilgore says, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning.”

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of War,” the post continued, which included an image of Trump dressed in an Army uniform and helicopters flying in the background with the words “Chipocalypse Now.”

Trump signed an executive order Friday authorizing the Department of War as a secondary title for the Department of Defense in a move that he said sends “a message of strength.”

The White House shared the post on its X account.

Gov. JB Pritzker responded to Trump’s post Saturday on X, saying it “is not normal.”

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Pritzker said in the post.

“This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

Speaking at the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade in Pilsen on Saturday, Sen. Dick Durbin called Trump’s post “disgusting.” “To suggest that the troops are coming into Chicago is an embarrassment,” he said.

In an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Briefing With Jen Psaki” on Friday night, Pritzker said the federal government was “preparing to invade the communities around Chicago like Little Village, like Pilsen perhaps beginning early morning tomorrow.”

In a post on X, Mayor Brandon Johnson called on Chicagoans to protect each other amid the threats.

“The President’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,” Johnson said in the post. “We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Defending people is what brought Priscilla Read to the Pilsen parade on Saturday.

“We’re organizing to document detentions, report them, and do our best to defend people who are detained. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons we’re here today. Cameras at the ready. So far, there haven’t been any incidents, but [we are] prepared to document because that’s basically what we can do at this point,” said Read, 76.

“If you are defenders of democracy and human rights, you need to be in solidarity right now.”

Kenneth Morrison of Pilsen watched the parade go by as he sat outside Cafe Jumping Bean. “It’s disturbing that [Trump] wants to pick a fight.”

He said he thinks the posts will continue to fuel preconceived negative notions of Chicago.

People not living in Chicago “believe the narrative that Chicago is a hellhole. They don’t see anything like what we just saw a moment ago,” he said of the celebration at the parade.

“They just think we’re dodging bullets,” he added.

Trump’s post comes as he ramps up federal enforcement in Chicago and the city prepares for anticipated increased operations by ICE.

The New York Times reports that ICE officials have requisitioned thousands of handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, as well as a number of gas masks, license plate readers and buses in advance of the Chicago operation.

In his MSNBC interview, Pritzker said the Illinois State Police received a call from Gregory Bovino, a leader at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and ICE who is leading the planned deployment in Chicago, who said troops “are coming and that they intend to be in place by the end of this week.”

This week, Trump suggested that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard, in addition to sending troops to Chicago and Baltimore. He sent troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month and to Los Angeles following clashes between hundreds of protesters and federal immigration authorities in riot gear.

Demonstrators protested Saturday outside the Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago where hundreds of federal agents are being sent to carry out Trump’s mission to curb crime and make immigration arrests in Chicago.

A protest was planned in the Loop at 5 p.m. Saturday.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/830f54f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2F93%2Fdcbd2d73402d8ef47c4799cc76ce%2Funtitled-design-copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 19:56:46.159658

Hiring an immigration attorney to defend against deportation?
The price hikes are yet another lesson in supply-and-demand economics, reflecting the challenges of hiring an immigration attorney when the market is flooded with so many would-be clients.
At the hearing, Figueroa said the judge recommended she find an immigration attorney.
By then, Guerrero had also moved there, but because she hadn’t updated her address, her immigration case remained in Florida.","As detentions spike amid a historic immigration crackdown, so has the price of legal remedies for those facing deportation.

Take a typical marriage-based green card case in Florida. Seven years ago, it might cost immigrants about $4,000 in legal fees. Hiring an immigration attorney to defend against deportation? Back then it could run around $10,000.

Today, the costs of green card cases have more than tripled, running up to $15,000, according to the Seattle-based Boundless Immigration group, which assists immigrants and their families with the legal system. Defense against deportation fees jumped 20% to as much as $12,000 or more.

These costs hit hardest for immigrants in labor and service jobs, unlike tech or professional workers, whose companies can cover some or all immigration paperwork.

The price hikes are yet another lesson in supply-and-demand economics, reflecting the challenges of hiring an immigration attorney when the market is flooded with so many would-be clients.

Immigration attorneys point to a combination of heavier caseloads along with more complicated cases that demand additional time and resources as reasons for climbing costs, leaving a growing number of immigrants without representation.

Lisette Sanchez, an immigration attorney in Tampa, said preparing even a simple case requires far more research, strategy and documentation than it did a decade ago. Additional time raises costs.

Sanchez also said demand for qualified immigration counsel has never been higher, while the supply of experienced attorneys has not kept up.

“Fees have gone up, but they reflect the growing demands and pressures of practicing in these areas,” Sanchez said.

Adonia Simpson, deputy director for policy and pro bono at the American Bar Association’s Commission on Immigration, said backlogs in immigration courts can add to costs. Nationwide, there are 3.4 million such cases, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Six in 10 people facing deportation lack legal counsel, according to the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice.

In Florida, about 500,000 people are in immigration court proceedings, and nearly 370,000 lack a lawyer, according to federal data collected by Syracuse University.

In Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco and Polk counties, more than 57,000 people are in removal proceedings, data shows, and fewer than 1 in 4 has a lawyer. Over thesummer, of 1,800 cases filed in those four counties, fewer than 1 in 5 had an attorney.

With new rules and policies, the work has become more difficult, said Simpson, requiring lengthy briefs, extensive evidence and careful client preparation.

The situation is daunting for immigrants who are detained and often on shortened timelines. With no court-appointed counsel, many proceed without representation, said Simpson.

“Having counsel can increase the likelihood of success on the merits of their case and improve efficiency of the courts,” said Simpson. “Unfortunately, due to funding cuts, many nonprofit organizations lack the capacity to provide free or low-cost representation.”

Robert Sichta, an immigration attorney with the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Florida, said the cost of hiring a lawyer is often out of reach for many, especially given their income levels. His group provides legal support but cannot take on every case, so it works with other attorneys who lower their fees and offer payment plans.

New fees and charges, including those tied to work permit applications for asylum-seekers, add another layer of financial strain, said Sichta.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced rates for various forms and applications under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July. Among the new costs:

$550 for an initial employment authorization and $275 for renewals;

a $100 filing fee for asylum applications and $100 annual asylum fee for pending cases;

$250 for Special Immigrant Juvenile petitions, which apply to anyone under age 21.

$500 for Temporary Protected Status, up from $50.

The fees increase each year based on inflation.

Many immigrants without legal representation have been in the country less than two years. Others are not yet employed and rely on temporary housing with family members or friends while they begin to settle into their communities.

“It’s an uphill battle that’s only getting worse,” Sichta said. “Unless, like regular courts, we start allowing the appointment of counsel paid for by government sources. As if that’s going to happen with the current administration.”

Alexa Figueroa arrived with no money when she crossed the southern border with her 10-year-old daughter last year using an app that allows immigrants to schedule appointments with border officials and request entry.

The app, CBP One, was introduced during the Biden administration. More than a million applied, obtaining work permits and receiving permission to stay in the country for up to two years.

Figueroa, 30, is unemployed and can barely cover her cellphone bill with the help of a sister she lives with in Davenport. Two weeks ago, she had her first hearing in immigration court in Orlando. No one was with her, except her daughter.

At the hearing, Figueroa said the judge recommended she find an immigration attorney. Otherwise, she would have to represent herself at her next hearing in October.

“I don’t know how I’m going to do it,” Figueroa said while waiting with her daughter for a relative to pick them up outside the court. “I want to do things the right way, but I have no savings and no job to pay a lawyer.”

Danielle Hernandez, an immigration attorney in Ybor City, said it’s understandable that many people who come to the United States do not have the ability to pay initially, and often do not consider the legal fees involved. Many only consider the hefty cost of being smuggled across the border, Hernandez said.

Isabel Guerrero, 47, from Colombia, entered the U.S. three years ago through Piedras Negras, a Mexican city near the Texas border, with one of her four children.

For her removal case,she hired an attorney who lives in South Carolina. By then, Guerrero had also moved there, but because she hadn’t updated her address, her immigration case remained in Florida. At a recent hearing in Orlando, she faced the judge alone.

Guerrero is in removal proceedings, a court process to decide whether someone should be deported. She said more than 60% of her wages from working in a vegetable warehouse go toward paying her lawyer and fees.

“If you only knew all the effort it takes to pay for a lawyer … you can’t even imagine, sometimes it’s not enough,” said Guerrero. “But it’s what you have to do. Alone, I don’t think I could make it.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/tampa_bay_times_articles_917/e80f9ec8d1667f7df48c0d4b986cbe8f,N,,2025-09-07 00:57:57.778432

The party plans to challenge the order in the Supreme Court, asserting its unwavering commitment to the Assam Accord.

Guwahati: BJP’s key ally in the NDA — Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) — on Saturday opposed the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order 2025 issued by the Union home ministry recently. In a news conference at the party headquarters, AGP vice-president Kumar Deepak Das said AGP would move the Supreme Court against the order, which he said violates the March 25, 1971, cut-off date endorsed by the Assam Accord for the detection and deportation of illegal migrants from Assam. Former AGP MP Kumar Dipak Das said, “The AGP has never compromised on the Assam Accord and will not do so.” Expressing dissatisfaction with the order that affects Assam and the northeast as well, the AGP clarified that despite being part of the NDA, it does not support this order that allows entry, stay, and exit of people of minority communities from neighbouring countries in India. Many organisations in Assam have viewed this order as an extension of the cut-off date of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act by 10 years. However, the AGP has not taken any decision to part ways with the NDA. “The AGP consistently opposed both the former CAB and the current CAA. Additionally, the AGP sought support from other national parties to oppose the CAA. The AGP challenged the CAA in the Supreme Court, saying that CAA cannot be implemented in Assam because, if implemented, it will violate the Assam Accord. It was due to the AGP’s petition that the SC ordered a separate hearing for Assam and the Northeast,” Das said. “Regarding the recent order, the AGP will once again file a petition in court challenging the recent directive,” he added. Das said the latest order has created a hurdle as far as the implementation of the Assam Accord is concerned. Considering the problems created by the home ministry’s order, the AGP, on Friday evening, convened a meeting of senior leaders where it was decided to move the SC against the order.

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from ending the Temporary Protected Status of more than one million people from Haiti and Venezuela.","Trump authorized a military strike on a boat in the Caribbean that his administration alleges was occupied by 11 members of the Tren de Aragua gang who were transporting drugs from Venezuela. The strike, which Trump said killed all 11 on board, took place without congressional approval and may have violated international human rights and maritime law. It remains unclear under what US legal or constitutional authority Trump took action or how the military determined that the individuals aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later said the military will keep assets in the region and strike anyone “trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist.”

A federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of the military to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the army from performing domestic law enforcement actions without authorization from Congress. While the judge noted that it’s legal to deploy the officials to protect federal property, he said that Trump is using the military as a “national police force with the President as its chief.”

A federal appeals court blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting Venezuelans accused of being in a gang under the Alien Enemies Act, finding there was no “invasion” or “predatory incursion” to do so, which is required under the 1798 wartime law.

The Department of Homeland Security said it would offer to pay the salaries and benefits of state and local police officers in jurisdictions that join a program to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The offer also includes up to 25% of an officer’s salary in overtime costs, along with performance-based bonuses for agencies in the program.

A federal appeals court reinstated a Biden appointee to the Federal Trade Commission, finding that Trump didn’t demonstrate “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” when he fired her in March.

The Washington Post reported that Hegseth plans to reassign up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges after a request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security. The move has raised concerns, including from one person involved in the planning of their reassignment, who says officers may not have experience or would receive insufficient training for immigration court proceedings, including deportation hearings.

A group of 85 top climate scientists warned that a recent climate assessment by Trump’s energy department “fails to adequately represent the current scientific understanding of climate change,” adding that, “No attempt appears to have been made to balance the points of view” by members working on the assessment. The scientists also said that the group “appears to have been personally recruited by the Secretary of Energy to advance a particular viewpoint favored by DOE leadership.”

AP reported that the Trump administration is requiring parents trying to reunite with their children who entered the US alone to attend identification checks where they may be questioned by immigration officers, according to a July policy memo. Legal advocacy organizations have said the move has led to some of the parents being arrested.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said he will be sending federal law enforcement to both Chicago and Baltimore, but didn’t specify a timeline for the deployment. Trump also said that many of the people arrested as part of his DC crackdown on crime were “born to be criminals.”

DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, issued an executive order to provide indefinite coordination with federal law enforcement. As the Washington Post writes, the order “may quell any showdown over what happens” when Trump’s 30-day federal takeover expires next week.

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie introduced what’s known as a discharge petition in an effort to force a vote on the release of the Epstein files. The measure must receive 218 signatures to succeed. A White House official later told NBC News in an email that Republicans deciding to sign on to the “attention-seeking” petition “would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.”

The New York Times reported that Trump’s advisers have discussed offering positions in the administration to New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the city’s Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa in an effort to help former Governor Andrew Cuomo defeat frontrunner and Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani in November’s general election. Politico later reported that Adams, who met with Trump’s team in Florida earlier this week, was offered a position at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.

During a press conference where survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s abuse called on lawmakers and the Justice Department to release the entirety of the files related to the sex traffickers, survivor Lisa Phillips announced that the group would create a confidential list of Epstein associates on their own if the government doesn’t take action, saying, “We will confidently compile the names we all know were regularly in the Epstein world.”

The Trump administration filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court’s ruling that found the majority of the president’s tariffs illegal, claiming in the filing that tariffs “are promoting peace and unprecedented economic prosperity"" and warning that a failure to allow them to move forward “would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses and thrust America back to the brink of economic catastrophe.” The administration also filed a motion to expedite the case.

More than 1,000 current and former Department of Health and Human Services employees signed a letter calling for RFK Jr. to resign, saying he “continues to endanger the nation’s health.” They say if Kennedy doesn’t resign, Trump and Congress should appoint a new secretary, “one whose qualifications and experience ensure that health policy is informed by independent and unbiased peer-reviewed science.”

AP reported that Trump is expected to ask the Supreme Court to overturn a jury decision in a civil lawsuit that found him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll, along with defamation, according to a filing last week that saw his lawyers ask the Supreme Court to extend a deadline for challenging the verdict to mid-November as Trump “intends to seek review” of “significant issues” related to the trial and an appeals court upholding the decision. In response, Carroll’s lawyer said, “We do not believe that President Trump will be able to present any legal issues in the Carroll cases that merit review” by the Supreme Court.

The House voted to toss a censure resolution against Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver, which would have also resulted in her removal from the Committee on Homeland Security. McIver was charged in May with assaulting and interfering with ICE agents at an immigration detention facility in New Jersey. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The Washington Post reported that a senior Justice Department official recently tried to gain access to voting equipment used by two Republican clerks in Missouri during the 2020 presidential election, a request the outlet called “unusual.”

The Post also reported that the top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, who is an ally of RFK Jr., is requiring new clinical trials before allowing pharmaceutical companies to claim that getting multiple respiratory virus vaccines, including for COVID-19 and the flu, is safe and effective, despite long-standing guidance encouraging multiple immunizations at the same time.

Trump renewed his threat to revoke Rosie O’Donnell’s US citizenship – a move he legally cannot do. Trump’s Truth Social post was shared by the official White House Twitter account along with a distorted photo of his prominent critic.

The Department of Homeland Security opened a new immigration detention facility at the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola, where 51 immigrants have already been taken into custody. Angola, the largest maximum-security prison in the US, was built on the grounds of a cotton plantation, and individuals incarcerated there are forced to work in the fields in extreme heat for as little as pennies an hour and face punishment if they refuse to work.

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from canceling $4.9 billion in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress, thwarting the president’s attempt to use a “pocket rescission” to claw back the funding. In his decision, the judge ordered the release of $11.5 billion in funds that are set to expire at the end of the month.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow said the Trump administration is planning to make the US citizenship test harder, calling the current test “just too easy.”

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll extended orders for National Guard troops to remain on active duty in DC until Nov. 30, though Trump could still terminate the mission earlier.

Reuters reported that current and former FBI employees are concerned that Trump’s use of agents in his DC law enforcement takeover is exposing the agency’s fleet of unmarked cars, which could compromise its national security and surveillance work.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s Justice Department launched an investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, following two criminal referrals for alleged mortgage fraud by the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The investigation, which has already resulted in the issuing of subpoenas, is being led by Trump’s “weaponization czar” and DOJ special attorney Ed Martin, who sent a letter to Fed chair Jerome Powell last month calling for him to fire Cook. In response, her lawyer noted that questions over how she described her properties aren’t fraud, “but it takes nothing for this DOJ to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again.”

The recently fired CDC director, Susan Monarez, penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal warning that while she lost her job, “America’s children could lose far more,” noting that she was directed to preapprove recommendations from a vaccine advisory panel “filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric” without reviewing them. She added, “The CDC can’t fulfill its obligation to the American people if its leader can’t demand proof in decision-making.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio placed new sanctions on three Palestinian non-governmental organizations that have participated in efforts by the International Criminal Court to investigate Israel’s war crimes in Gaza, saying in a press release that the department “will actively oppose actions that threaten our national interests and infringe on the sovereignty of the United States and our allies, including Israel.”

The acting deputy chief of a Justice Department unit was caught on a hidden camera by the far-right O’Keefe Media Group saying that the government will “redact every Republican” from a list of Epstein associates and “leave all the liberal, Democratic people in those files.” He also said Ghislaine Maxwell was transferred to a minimum-security prison in an effort to offer “her something to keep her mouth shut.” In a statement, the official said his comments were based on “what I’ve learned in the media and not from anything I’ve done at or learned via work.” On Twitter, a DOJ spokesperson said the official’s comments “have absolutely zero bearing with reality and reflect a total lack of knowledge of the DOJ’s review process.”

Trump filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to block the reinstatement of a Biden-appointed Federal Trade Commission member and let her termination proceed while the legality of the move is challenged in court.

Multiple outlets reported that the Justice Department is considering banning trans people from owning firearms by designating being trans as a mental illness that could disqualify someone from possessing a firearm under existing regulations.

The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration is expected to halt security assistance programs for some European countries, including one designed to train and arm militaries in Eastern Europe that would be on the frontline of any conflict with Russia.

Trump’s Justice Department sued the city of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu over sanctuary policies it calls an “intentional effort to obstruct” the enforcement of federal immigration laws.

DC sued the Trump administration to block the president’s federal law enforcement takeover, arguing the deployment of out-of-state troops violates the Constitution and federal law, writing in the lawsuit, “No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation.”

A federal appeals court temporarily lifted a judge’s order restricting the Trump administration’s use of National Guard troops in Los Angeles as the president appeals the ruling.

In a court filing, the Trump administration warned that the government will seek to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to El Salvador if his attempt to open an asylum case in the US is successful, arguing the move would nullify an earlier ruling meant to prevent him from being sent back to his home country.

The New York Times reported that Trump advisers are working on a plan to nominate New York City Mayor Eric Adams to be the US ambassador to Saudi Arabia if he drops out of the upcoming mayoral election. In a statement, Adams said, “While I will always listen if called to serve our country, no formal offers have been made” for a position in the Trump administration and that he is still running for re-election.

The Times also reported that in 2019, during Trump’s first term, the president greenlit a top secret operation which sent a team of Navy SEALs to North Korea to plant an electronic device in an effort to intercept the communications of Kim Jong-Un. The mission was unsuccessful after the SEALs killed a boat crew of unarmed civilians and sank their bodies. The Trump administration never told Congressional leaders about the operation, potentially violating federal law.

Trump went on an unhinged rant on Truth Social about the Epstein scandal, which he once again blamed on Democrats who “only brought [it] back to life … because they are doing so poorly.” He claimed that Democratic lawmakers “don’t care about the victims,” calling the controversy around the Epstein files “merely another Democrat HOAX … in order to deflect and distract” from Trump’s success.

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from ending the Temporary Protected Status of more than one million people from Haiti and Venezuela.

Trump signed an executive order to make the Department of War the secondary title for the Department of Defense, a move that gets around Congressional approval to formally rename a federal agency.

He also signed another executive order that would establish a designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, which will allow the US to punish countries for illegally detaining US citizens or taking them hostage.

Speaking to reporters, Trump responded to Venezuela flying jets over US ships, saying, “If they put us in a dangerous position, they will be shot down.”

He announced that the US will host the G20 summit in 2026 at his resort in Miami, where the attendees will be billed at cost.

Trump once again called for the release of Tina Peters, a former county clerk in Colorado who was convicted of several charges after using someone’s security badge to allow an associate of Trump ally and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell to access county election equipment following the 2020 presidential election. While Trump added that his administration is “going to do something” about it, the president isn’t able to pardon individuals convicted of state charges.

The criticism prompted an unusual apology from Judge Young at a hearing last week.","Justice Stephen G. Breyer on Saturday defended a judge accused of defying a Supreme Court ruling, saying in an interview that he knew the judge to be scrupulously honest and respectful of higher courts.

Justice Breyer, who retired from the court in 2022, has avoided criticism of his former colleagues. He declined on Saturday to directly address Justice Neil M. Gorsuch’s concurring opinion last month accusing Judge William G. Young, of the Federal District Court in Boston, of ignoring a binding precedent.

But that opinion plainly prompted Justice Breyer’s decision to step forward with rare public comments in praise of Judge Young as model jurist whose rulings he had often reviewed during his 14 years as an appeals court judge in Boston.

“I never saw an instance where he would deliberately defy a controlling opinion or legal statement from our court or from the Supreme Court,” Justice Breyer said. “I never even had an instinct or a guess or a hunch or anything that he was doing anything like that deliberately.”

Justice Breyer’s comments were the latest indication of growing tensions within the judiciary, as courts grapple with the flood of lawsuits prompted by the Trump administration’s sweeping efforts to remake the government, and as trial judges struggle to interpret the Supreme Court’s emergency orders.

Justice Gorsuch had harsh words for Judge Young, accusing him of serious misconduct in a ruling restoring grants from the National Institutes of Health that the Trump administration had sought to cancel.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” Justice Gorsuch wrote, adding that Judge Young had ignored the reasoning in an unsigned four-paragraph interim order in a different case in April.

Justice Gorsuch acknowledged that such orders are not final determinations, but said that “even probabilistic holdings” like the one in April must command respect. “Whatever their own views, judges are duty bound to respect ‘the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress,’” he added, citing an earlier opinion.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh joined the concurring opinion.

The criticism prompted an unusual apology from Judge Young at a hearing last week.

“Before we do anything, I really feel it’s incumbent upon me to — on the record here — to apologize to Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh if they think that anything this court has done has been done in defiance of a precedential action of the Supreme Court of the United States,” said Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1985.

He added that “I can do nothing more than to say as honestly as I can: I certainly did not so intend, and that is foreign in every respect to the nature of how I have conducted myself as a judicial officer.”

Judge Young was not alone in trying to make sense of the Supreme Court’s cryptic orders on what critics call its shadow docket. Ruling for Harvard last week in its suit against the Trump administration, Judge Allison D. Burroughs, another federal judge in Boston, wrote that “the Supreme Court’s recent emergency docket rulings regarding grant terminations have not been models of clarity, and have left many issues unresolved.”

Responding to Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence, she wrote that “it is unhelpful and unnecessary to criticize district courts for ‘defying’ the Supreme Court when they are working to find the right answer in a rapidly evolving doctrinal landscape, where they must grapple with both existing precedent and interim guidance from the Supreme Court that appears to set that precedent aside without much explanation or consensus.”

At last week’s hearing, Judge Young, 84, seemed to be reeling from a blow to his reputation administered by a Supreme Court justice.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/06/multimedia/06dc-breyer-pjcw/06dc-breyer-pjcw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 21:58:43.860096

The new home secretary is reportedly set to announce the use of Ministry of Defence sites to house people after a wave of protests outside migrant accommodation over the summer.

The scale of the challenge facing the former justice secretary was illustrated on Saturday when an estimated 1,000 people arrived in the UK by small boats.

It comes after the prime minister carried out a major reshuffle including wide-ranging changes at the Home Office as he seeks to tighten his grip on immigration and draw a line under Angela Rayner’s resignation.

The chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, earlier denied that the government was in crisis and insisted Starmer now has the “strongest team” in place around the cabinet table following Rayner’s departure.

He ruled out the prospect of an early election amid opposition claims that the upheaval could open splits within Labour and collapse the prime minister’s authority.

Speaking to broadcasters on Saturday, Jones dismissed suggestions that the rejig could delay the Starmer’s self-described “phase two” of government by moving senior figures to unfamiliar briefs.

“It’s not instability insofar as the outcomes that we’re delivering are the same,” Jones, who is also the newly appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Breakfast.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d9f282c7de2a9b9f5ce7196323f48199b97110/1470_0_2083_1666/master/2083.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=abe6cbcca9362ebd8a4d278b51b8362a",N,,2025-09-06 18:56:48.756312

WASHINGTON – On Friday September 5, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement officers across the country were working to deliver on President Trump’s mandate to make America safe again. ICE agents continue to target criminal illegal aliens wreaking havoc in some of the biggest cities across the nation.

“While Americans were enjoying their Friday night, ICE was hard at work arresting criminal illegal aliens across the country including in Houston, New York City, Salt Lake City, San Diego, and Atlanta,” said a DHS Spokesperson. “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens.

Donggin Shin, 37, was apprehended by immigration authorities in a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado and placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. His father brought him to the U.S. from South Korea when he was a child and he lives in Salt Lake City, according to his attorney, Adam Crayk.

Shin, who goes by the name John, was held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado — more than 500 miles away from his home — according to an ICE database. He was released on $25,000 bond on Tuesday.

“I never thought I would have to feel what it’s like to be shackled on my ankles and my wrist, feeling like some kind of a serious criminal, as if I have murdered someone,” Shin said at a press conference Friday, according to KSL-TV, an NBC affiliate based in Salt Lake City.

“I was absolutely terrified. Obviously, I cried all day,” he added.

Shin was held for a total of 17 days and is now wearing an ankle monitor, according to Crayk.

Shin was identified by ICE’s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered national security threats, according to charging documents.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In response to previous questions about Shin, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News: “Our message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.”

The official added that Shin had a DUI conviction. Records show the matter was resolved after Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense in 2020 and served his probation.

Crayk, Shin’s attorney, told NBC New in a previous interview that his client’s father was battling brain cancer at the time of his prior arrest.

“My father was losing a battle to a Level 4 glioblastoma brain tumor. He had limited time to live,” Shin said, according to KSL-TV. “I fell into a depression during that time and the impaired driving followed.”

Shin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on Sept. 3, 1998, which “required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999,” according to DHS. But Crayk previously told NBC News that this timeline is incomplete, as Shin’s father switched to a student visa, which conferred status onto Shin at the time.

Crayk said Shin became a DACA recipient years later, but lost his DACA protections due to his 2020 conviction. He has remained without lawful status for the last four and a half years.

Shin works in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West in recent years.

Musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to raise awareness until Shin returns home.

Recent judicial rulings and legislative proposals, such as the Dignity Act of 2025, underscore the fragility of labor supply chains in agriculture, hospitality, and healthcare. For investors, this uncertainty presents both risks and opportunities, as capital allocation shifts toward automation and labor diversification strategies.

The TPS Dilemma: Legal Uncertainty and Labor Market Volatility

The Trump administration’s 2025 efforts to terminate TPS protections for Venezuelans and Haitians have triggered a cascade of legal challenges. A federal judge initially blocked these actions, calling them “arbitrary and capricious,” but the Supreme Court later allowed the administration to proceed, creating a legal limbo for 350,000 individuals [1]. This instability has disrupted labor markets: in Florida alone, TPS holders contributed $485.9 million in state and local taxes in 2023, supporting critical services like education and infrastructure [3]. Their sudden removal could destabilize industries already grappling with post-pandemic labor shortages.

Agriculture, for instance, relies on TPS holders for 25% of its workforce, with over half of agricultural product graders being foreign-born [2]. The termination of TPS protections has already led to a 30% increase in operational costs and a 15% drop in output in some regions [1]. Similarly, hospitality and healthcare face acute challenges. In South Florida, 15,000 Venezuelan TPS holders previously worked in hospitality, and their absence has forced businesses to cut services or raise prices [1]. Healthcare, which employs 50,000 TPS holders as home health aides and nursing assistants, risks a 135,000-worker shortage by 2036 if immigration policies tighten further [2].

Capital Allocation Shifts: Automation and Diversification

Faced with labor shortages, industries are accelerating investments in automation and workforce diversification. In agriculture, AI-driven systems for crop monitoring and robotic harvesters are gaining traction, with California’s $50 billion agricultural sector leading the charge [4]. Hospitality chains like Disney and Walmart have already begun replacing TPS-dependent roles with automated inventory systems and AI-powered customer service tools [5]. Meanwhile, healthcare providers are adopting AI for diagnostics and administrative tasks, reducing reliance on human labor for routine functions [6].

The Dignity Act of 2025, which includes provisions for asylum reform and legal immigration updates, may further shape these trends. While the bill does not directly address TPS, its emphasis on border security and workforce modernization signals a regulatory environment where automation and compliance-driven labor strategies will thrive [7]. Investors are also eyeing hybrid solutions: for example, combining automation with targeted recruitment of non-TPS immigrant workers or expanding vocational training programs to upskill domestic labor [3].

Investment Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the key risks lie in sector-specific vulnerabilities. Agriculture and hospitality face immediate exposure to labor disruptions, with operational costs projected to rise as TPS protections wane. Conversely, opportunities exist in firms developing automation technologies, labor analytics platforms, and compliance software tailored to immigration-dependent industries. The healthcare sector, while facing long-term staffing challenges, offers growth potential in AI-driven care solutions and telehealth services that reduce reliance on in-person labor [6].

However, the political landscape remains unpredictable. The Biden administration’s potential reinstatement of TPS protections could stabilize labor markets, while further Trump-era policies might accelerate automation adoption. Investors must also weigh the ethical and reputational risks of over-reliance on automation, which could exacerbate job displacement among low-skilled workers [8].

Conclusion

The TPS litigation saga highlights the intersection of immigration policy, labor economics, and technological innovation. While legal uncertainty poses short-term risks, it also drives long-term capital reallocation toward resilient, technology-enabled solutions. Investors who navigate this landscape by hedging against labor volatility—through diversified portfolios that include automation firms, compliance experts, and immigrant workforce advocates—may position themselves to thrive in an evolving economic order.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 22:57:00.755461

“Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man,” he added. “Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Trump earlier Saturday posted an image generated by artificial intelligence (AI) to his Truth Social platform that showed his likeness as a law enforcement official. The background includes an image of Chicago burning, several helicopters and text that reads “Chipocalypse Now” — a nod to the 1979 movie “Apocalypse Now.”

In the caption, the president wrote, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning… Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The comment comes just a day after he signed an executive order to rebrand the Defense Department to the Department of War.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) railed against the post in a Saturday social media post, stating it is “beneath the honor of our nation.”

“But the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,” Johnson wrote on X. “We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Trump late last month signaled his administration would look to the Windy City next in its efforts to tackle crime and illegal immigration. The White House already confirmed that is looking to use a Navy base near Chicago to support its migrant detention efforts.

The president has also threatened to deploy National Guard troops to the city, pointing to what he called success in his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., to aid in the expected crackdown. While his moves in the nation’s capital are protected under the federal district’s Home Rule Act, Illinois is a sovereign state.

Any effort to deploy troops to Chicago without the governor requesting assistance would likely result in a legal battle, like the one that played out in Los Angeles over deportation raids.

Local officials in The Prairie State have pushed back on the administration’s threat, suggesting Trump is overstepping his authority. Johnson signed a protective order late last month to combat the potential deployment of soldiers.

The city’s Office of Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee Rights also rolled out an updated website earlier this week with step-by-step guidance on how immigrants can protect themselves.

Pritzker has blasted Trump for suggesting that major cities should be asking the federal government for assistance with law enforcement, citing dwindling crime statistics and calling the request “an insult.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Pritzker-Trump-09.06.png?w=1280,N,,2025-09-06 17:56:56.805569

The statement added that Munoz-Gutierrez had been repatriated after being transferred to the custody of Mexican Ambassador Alejandro Estivill Castro in a “smooth and orderly” process.

South Sudan thanked Mexico for its cooperation and said it had received assurances Munoz-Gutierrez would not be subjected to “torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, or undue prosecution upon his return”.

The statement said he had been treated with “full respect for his human dignity and fundamental rights” during his stay in the capital, Juba.

The repatriation was carried out “in full accordance with relevant international law, bilateral agreements, and established diplomatic protocols”, it added.

‘Felt kidnapped’

In comments to journalists in Juba, Munoz-Gutierrez said he “felt kidnapped” when the US sent him to South Sudan.

“I was not planning to come to South Sudan, but while I was here, they treated me well,” he said. “I finished my time in the United States, and they were supposed to return me to Mexico. Instead, they wrongfully sent me to South Sudan.”

The US Department of Homeland Security has said Munoz-Gutierrez had a conviction for second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.

South Sudan is discussing with other countries the repatriation of the six deportees still in its custody, said Apuk Ayuel Mayen, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry.

It is not clear if the deportees have access to legal representation. Only one of eight was from South Sudan.

Rights groups have argued that the Trump administration’s increasing practice of deporting migrants to third countries violates international law and the basic rights of migrants.

The deportations have faced opposition by courts in the US although the Supreme Court in June allowed the government to restart swift removals of migrants to countries other than their homelands.

Other African nations receiving deportees from the US include Uganda, Eswatini and Rwanda. Eswatini received five men with criminal backgrounds in July.

Rwanda announced the arrival of a group of seven deportees in mid-August.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25249617341152-1757189490.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-06 17:57:06.874054

Georgia officials have touted the Hyundai Metaplant America site as a game changer for the state.","South Korea's foreign minister is considering a trip to the U.S. to meet with the Trump administration after hundreds of South Korean nationals were arrested in Georgia this week at an electric vehicle battery plant.

""We are deeply concerned and feel a heavy sense of responsibility over the arrests of our nationals,"" Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said at an emergency meeting in Seoul, according to the national Yonhap News Agency.

He said South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called for all-out efforts to swiftly resolve the matter, Yonhap reported, ""stressing that the rights and interests of South Korean nationals and the business operations of South Korean companies investing in the United States must not be infringed upon.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, in a raid Thursday at a massive electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Ellabell, Ga., near Savannah. The plant is a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution.

ICE released video of what officials say is the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the Homeland Security Investigations. It shows officers shackling workers and loading them onto Georgia prison buses.

""This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans,"" said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations for Georgia and Alabama, during a news conference announcing the operation. ""We are sending a clear and unequivocal message that those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy and violate federal laws will be held accountable.""

He said it was not an operation where agents simply rounded up people and put them on buses, but the result of a months-long investigation. The workers, Schrank said, were either illegally present in the U.S. or working unlawfully.

The arrests add to tension with a key ally at a time when President Trump has been pushing for trade deals and more South Korean investment in the U.S. Hyundai also has an auto plant in Montgomery, Ala., and has announced plans to invest more than $5 billion in a steel plant in Louisiana.

""I would say that they were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job,"" Trump said when asked about the raid at the White House on Friday.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia says the raid raises questions about both the president's immigration strategy and how the firms were able to allegedly employ workers without proper documentation.

""Companies should not be able to get rich in Georgia by exploiting immigrant workers and putting them at risk of politically motivated raids and violations of due process,"" Warnock said in a statement. ""It's bad for our economy, bad for Georgia's workers, and bad for law-abiding Georgia families living in fear of this administration.""

Hyundai Motor Co. says it's working to understand the specific circumstances of the arrests.

""Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,"" the company said in a statement, promising an internal investigation into employment compliance.

""Hyundai has zero tolerance for those who don't follow the law,"" it said.

In a statement to Yonhap on Saturday, LG Energy Solution said it has suspended all business trips to the U.S. and told workers visiting the U.S. to stay in their accommodations or return to South Korea immediately. The company said its chief human resources officer is heading to the U.S. to address the issues on site.

""We will make every effort to promptly resolve the situation, including ensuring the speedy and safe return of all employees,"" LG Energy Solution said.

Georgia officials have touted the Hyundai Metaplant America site as a game changer for the state. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has said it has provided ""historic benefits"" and new opportunities for workers. In a statement, a spokesperson for Kemp's office said: ""In Georgia, we will always enforce the law, including all state and federal immigration laws"" and noted that the state Department of Public Safety coordinated with ICE to support the operation. It said the Georgia National Guard is also providing administrative support to ICE.

The immigration crackdown is also drawing support from Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Congressman Buddy Carter, whose district includes the plant site in Ellabell, Ga.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+221/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2F53%2F2f7215fb41adae35cb5deffe0f79%2Fgettyimages-2233256192.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 17:57:09.686829

- Encaleret was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported over the study period

- Based on these findings, BridgeBio intends to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret, an orally-administered investigational therapy, in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026

PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, announced today that encaleret showed parathyroid hormone (PTH)-independent normalization of blood and urine calcium in post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. The Phase 2 results were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting 2025.

“Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a challenging condition to manage because treatment involves striking a balance between blood and urine calcium. With conventional therapy, using calcium and active vitamin D, we typically aim for a low or low-normal blood calcium to reduce the risk of high urinary calcium which can cause kidney calcifications and renal injury. Unfortunately, not all patients are able to achieve this balance, and many still struggle – some with the disruptive symptoms of low blood calcium, and others with persistently high urine calcium,” said Iris Hartley, M.D., endocrinologist and clinician investigator at the National Institute of Dental and Cranial Facial Research of the National Institutes of Health. “There is a clear need for better options. New results from this study are very promising, suggesting a potential path for improved calcium control in a convenient pill form.”

The Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluated the PTH-independent effects of encaleret on renal calcium handling in patients with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Ten participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism were administered encaleret at 162 mg twice daily for up to 5 days. Calcitriol was stopped one day prior to the first dose. After starting encaleret, calcium and calcitriol were titrated based on blood calcium. The findings from the study include:

Encaleret treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in fractional excretion of calcium in nine participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism

80% of post-surgical hypoparathyroidism participants achieved concomitant blood and urine calcium in the normal reference range within 5 days of treatment initiation compared to 0% of participants on conventional therapy at baseline

These results support the continued evaluation of encaleret as an orally-administered treatment option for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism

“These Phase 2 results show that encaleret may help normalize blood and urine calcium in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, in the absence of stimulating PTH secretion, due to its effect on the calcium-sensing receptor expressed in the kidney. Based on these encouraging findings, we intend to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026,” said Scott Adler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Calcilytix, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing encaleret.

During ASBMR 2025, we also presented data from two preclinical studies of infigratinib, which demonstrated that low-dose infigratinib significantly improved bone growth in a hypochondroplasia mouse model as well as enhanced skull development in a Crouzon/Pfeiffer syndrome model. These data underscore the therapy’s broad potential for treating skeletal conditions. Additionally, the study of infigratinib in the hypochondroplasia mouse model was recently published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

SHANGHAI, China, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hesai Group (NASDAQ: HSAI) (“Hesai” or the “Company”), the global leader in three-dimensional light detection and ranging (lidar) solutions, today announced the launch of its global offering (the “Global Offering”) of 17,000,000 Class B ordinary shares of the Company, which comprises a Hong Kong public offering of initially 1,700,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing on September 8, 2025 Hong Kong time (the “Hong Kong Public Offering”) and an international offering of initially 15,300,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing today (the “International Offering”), and dual-primary listing of its Class B ordinary shares on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong Kong Stock Exchange”) under the stock code “2525”.

The Company’s American depositary shares (the “ADSs”), each representing one Class B ordinary share of the Company, will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”). Investors in the Global Offering will only be able to purchase Class B ordinary shares and will not be able to take delivery of ADSs. Upon listing of the Class B ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Class B ordinary shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be fully fungible with the ADSs listed on Nasdaq.

The Company has an offer size adjustment option, exercisable with prior written agreement with the Sponsor-OCs (as defined below) on or before the time of pricing, pursuant to which the Company may allot and issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, to cover additional demand.

In addition, the Company expects to grant the international underwriters an over-allotment option to require the Company to issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares in the International Offering (or up to 2,932,500 Class B ordinary shares if the offer size adjustment option is exercised in full), representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Global Offering.

The initial number of Class B ordinary shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Offering represent approximately 10% and 90% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, respectively, subject to reallocation, offer size adjustment, and over-allotment. Subject to the level of oversubscription in the Hong Kong Public Offering and reallocation, as described in the Hong Kong prospectus to be issued by the Company in Hong Kong dated September 8, 2025, the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering could be adjusted to up to a maximum of 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering.

The offer price for the Hong Kong Public Offering (the “Hong Kong Offer Price”) will be no more than HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share (the “Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price”), or US$29.04, per Class B ordinary share (equivalent to US$29.04 per ADS) based on an exchange rate of HK$7.8499 to US$1.00 as of June 30, 2025 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The offer price for the International Offering tranche of the Global Offering (the “International Offer Price”) may be set higher than, or the same as, the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price. The Company will set the International Offer Price on or about September 12, 2025, Hong Kong time, by taking into consideration, among other factors, the closing price of the ADSs on the Nasdaq on the last trading day on or before September 12, 2025 and investor demand during the marketing process. The final Hong Kong Offer Price will be set at the lower of the final International Offer Price and the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price of HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share. The shares will be traded in board lots of 20 Class B ordinary shares.

The Company has entered into cornerstone investment agreements with HHLR Advisors (part of Hillhouse Group), Taikang Life, WT Asset Management, Grab, Hongda Group and Commando Global Fund. Under such agreements, the cornerstone investors have agreed to, subject to certain conditions, subscribe for such number of Class B ordinary shares that may be purchased with an aggregate amount of approximately US$148.0 million, or approximately HK$1,153.7 million at the International Offer Price, representing approximately 29.8% of the Class B ordinary shares initially being offered under the Global Offering assuming such Class B ordinary shares are sold at the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price, which percentage is subject to the offer size adjustment option and the over-allotment option. Such Class B ordinary shares are being sold in reliance on Regulation S and are exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and this cornerstone placing will form part of the International Offering.

The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering for investment in research and development, investment in its manufacturing capabilities, business development to accelerate its business expansion, and working capital and general corporate purposes.

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.
The case has had numerous legal twists, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.
A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.","SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal protections that have granted more than 1 million people from Haiti and Venezuela the right to live and work in the United States.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco for the plaintiffs means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the U.S. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians.

Chen scolded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for revoking protections for Venezuelans and Haitians that the judge said would send them ""back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries.""

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.

Presidential administrations have executed the law for 35 years based on the best available information and in consultation with other agencies, ""a process that involves careful study and analysis. Until now,"" Chen wrote.

Plaintiffs and their attorneys welcomed the news Friday, although it's unclear if it would help people who have already been deported.

""In recent months, people have suffered unspeakable harm — including deportation and family separation — due to the Supreme Court greenlighting Secretary Noem's discriminatory and harmful agenda,"" said Emi Maclean, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California. ""That must end now.""

A DHS spokesperson said in an email that the program has been ""abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program"" and that ""unelected activist judges"" cannot stop the American people's desire for a secure country.

""While this order delays justice, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,"" the email read.

The second Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has resulted in ramped-up arrests of people in the country illegally, but also an end to programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in immigrants' homelands are deemed unsafe.

According to court documents, the administration has terminated Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and Humanitarian Parole designations for about 1.5 million people, prompting lawsuits across the country from immigrant advocates.

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States, if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.

Haiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.

Their designations were to expire in September but later extended until February, due to a separate court order out of New York.

Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the countries to stay on for what is a temporary program. Attorneys for the government have said the secretary's clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program are not subject to judicial review.

Designations are granted for terms of six, twelve or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.

The secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violated the law, Chen wrote.

The case has had numerous legal twists, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In March, Chen temporarily paused the administration's plans to end TPS for people from Venezuela. An estimated 350,000 Venezuelans were set to lose protections the following month.

But the U.S. Supreme Court in May reversed his order while the lawsuit played out. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals, and did not rule on the merits of the case.

Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.

A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.

After appearing for her annual immigration check-in, a restaurant hostess living in Indiana was deported back to Venezuela in July. Her husband, a construction company supervisor, cannot work and care for their baby daughter at the same time.

In June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states. He slept for about two weeks on a floor, terrified he would be sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. His wife cannot maintain the household on her earnings.

""I am not a criminal,"" he said in the declaration, adding that ""immigrants like myself come to the United States to work hard and contribute, and instead our families and lives are being torn apart.""

The Supreme Court's reversal does not apply to Friday's ruling. The government is expected to appeal.

Seoul has dispatched diplomats to the site in Georgia, while LG Energy Solution, which operates the plant with Hyundai, said it was suspending most business trips to the US.

US officials detained 475 people - mostly South Korean nationals - who they said were found to be illegally working at the battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in the state.

The White House defended the operation, dismissing concerns that the raid could deter foreign investment.

""They were illegal aliens and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] was just doing its job,"" President Donald Trump said following the raids on Friday.

Video released by ICE officials showed Asian workers shackled in front of a building, with some wearing yellow vests with names such as ""Hyundai"" and ""LG CNS"".

""People on short-term or recreational visas are not authorized to work in the US,"" ICE said, adding that the raid was necessary to protect American jobs.

""This operation sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable,"" Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent Steven Schrank said in a statement on Saturday.

South Korea, a close US ally, has pledged tens of billions of dollars in American manufacturing investment, partly to offset tariffs.

The timing of the raid, as the two governments engage in sensitive trade talks, has raised concern in Seoul.

Trump has actively encouraged major investments from other countries while also tightening visa allocations for foreign companies.

Many of the LG employees arrested were on business trips with various visas or under a visa waiver programme, officials say.

South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Hyun said he felt a ""great sense of responsibility for the arrest of our citizens"" as he presided over an emergency meeting about the issue on Saturday.

He said the government had set up an Overseas Korean Protection Task Force to respond to the arrests and that he may travel to Washington if needed.

""Immediately after this incident became known, the President stressed that U.S. law enforcement actions must not unjustly infringe upon the rights of our nationals or the economic activities of our Korean-invested companies,"" he said.

On Saturday, LG Energy Solution announced it was sending its Chief Human Resources Officer Kim Ki-soo to the Georgia site on Sunday.

""We are making all-out efforts to secure the swift release of detained individuals from our company and partner firms,"" it said in a statement.

""We are confirming regular medications for families through an emergency contact network for detainees and plan to request that necessary medications be delivered to those detained.""

The company said it was suspending most business trips to the US and directing employees on assignment in the US to return home immediately.

South Korean media widely described the raid as a ""shock,"" with the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper warning it could have ""a chilling effect on the activities of our businesses in the United States"".

The factory, which makes new electric vehicles, had been touted by Georgia's Republican governor as the biggest economic development project in the state's history, employing 1,200 people.

The arrested workers were being held at an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, until the agency decides where to move them next.

In a 69-page ruling, Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California characterized the decision of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to end TPS for Haiti and Venezuela as capricious, arbitrary and beyond the scope of her authority.

“The Secretary’s actions in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law,” Chen wrote on Friday.

Chen restored a Biden-era TPS extension that runs until October 2026 for Venezuelans and February 2026 for Haitians. The Department of Homeland Security in July had already begrudgingly agreed to keep that expiration date for Haiti after a separate federal ruling from New York.

The ruling is a long-awaited relief for over 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, whose immigration protections hinged on Chen. On Friday, advocates and immigrants went to celebrate at El Arepazo restaurant in Doral, where Venezuelans have long-gathered to commemorate community milestones.

Cecilia González Herrera, the only plaintiff who lives in Florida, told the Herald over text that the judge’s order was a “tremendous victory.” The University of Central Florida student came to the United States eight years ago, fleeing with her parents because they were involved in anti-government movements.

“Judge Chen’s decision is a reminder that the institutions of this country are stronger than any political agenda. This ruling recognizes both the legality and the humanity of TPS. The road ahead is long, but today we are reminded that justice prevails,” said the 26-year-old Kissimmee woman.

Chen said Friday that Noem’s move to roll back the Biden-era extensions was “extraordinary and unusual.” He noted in his decision that it was the first time such an action had happened since Congress made the program into a law in 1990.

“We celebrate today that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans can sleep more peacefully today. We celebrate that due process and justice still exist in this country ... We are very grateful to this country and its justice system. Today is a great day and we will honor it by being the best citizens we can be,” said Adelys Ferro, Miami-based director of the national organization Venezuelan-American Caucus.

“An existential crisis”

The federal government can grant Temporary Protected Status to immigrants who cannot safely return to their home countries because of war, natural disasters and other devastating circumstances.

President Joe Biden first granted Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans in 2021, citing repressive governance, food insecurity, human rights violations, acute poverty, crumbling infrastructure and insufficient healthcare. Two years later, he expanded the protections so recently arrived Venezuelans could benefit, making it the nationality with the largest pool of beneficiaries.

Separately, Biden thrice designated Haiti for Temporary Protected Status in the aftermath of the murder of President Jovenel Moise, a devastating earthquake, mass internal displacement, widespread gang violence, chronic hunger and extreme impoverishment.

But since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has ended Temporary Protected Status protections for immigrants from Haiti, Venezuela and several other countries — which he previously attempted during his first term. In February, the Trump administration ended the 2023 protections for about 352,000 Venezuelans. This week, it announced protections granted in 2021 would expire for another 250,000 people from the South American country on Sept. 10.

In the termination notice, the Department of Homeland Security argued that there had been notable improvements — including in public health, the economy and crime — that made it safe to go back to Venezuela. However, the agency said, the termination was required regardless of conditions because the TPS designation was against national interests.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal Chen’s decision, part of a lawsuit the National TPS Alliance filed in San Francisco. The federal government had already asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the spring. In May, the Justices gave Homeland Security the green light to end the program. That left the vast majority of Venezuelans under the 2023 TPS designation without the protections, despite a preliminary order for Chen keeping them in place. However, the nation’s highest court has not weighed on the merits of the case. An appeals court in California also recently affirmed a preliminary order on Chen’s original decision.

In his ruling, Chen noted that the government had not submitted any evidence documenting the improvements in Venezuela’s case, or conducted any meaningful review of how Venezuela was doing before ending the protections. “The draft of the termination decision was being prepared before any country condition analysis was conducted,” wrote Chen.

Chen also denied the Trump administration’s motion to throw out the lawsuit and dismissed its claims that Biden Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas had improperly extended Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status.

A lifeline

There were about 605,000 Venezuelans and 331,000 Haitians with Temporary Protected Status as of March 31, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service. Florida is the state by far with the biggest population of TPS holders, with 403,965 beneficiaries living there. Nearly all are Haitian or Venezuelan.

José Abinazar, a 26-year-old living in South Florida, expressed hope for the future in the wake of Judge Chen’s decision.

“This ruling brings peace of mind knowing that I can continue working and supporting my family,” he said. “Returning to Venezuela is neither viable nor safe.”

The licensed engineer came to the United States as a minor, where he has built a life rooted in public service. He graduated from Florida International University’s Honors College and now works on vital infrastructure projects that enhance community safety and climate resilience, including Miami-Dade County’s Stormwater Master Plan. He is also active in industry groups that promote professional development, environmental health and social advocacy.

“The work we do is essential for protecting our communities and preparing for the future,” he said, emphasizing that highly-specialized professionals working on critical issues like climate change like him are facing the threat of deportation under Trump administration policies. TPS “ensures I can keep working.”

For Mariana Molero and her husband, who have resided in the United States for two decades, Chen’s ruling extends beyond a legal formality. It’s how they can stay in the United States with their American-born teenagers, who have never been to Venezuela, without fearing family separation.

“It’s a joy, not only for me and my husband, but for my close relatives and for the whole community,” Molero, who lives with her family in Kissimmee, said. “We will be able to have an instrument in our hands that protects us.”

Molero and her husband arrived in the United States in 2003, fleeing after they were persecuted for working alongside opposition leader Juan Pablo Guanipa. Molero and her husband have remained active in the Venezuelan diaspora and denouncing human rights abuses in their home country. ” For Molero and her husband, returning to Venezuela could be not just a return to a homeland in trouble, but a danger to their lives.

“I have no doubt the regime would want to retaliate, even through physical persecution or forced disappearances. Our activism has been extensive,” she said. “Going back would expose us directly to reprisals.”

Despite the political persecution they faced in Venezuela for their activism, their asylum cases were denied. They have been under deportation orders since 2011. Chen’s decision allows them to continue their American life, alongside their children a little longer.

“At least for a short time we have a decision that protects us,” Molero said. “The uncertainty continues, but today we can breathe a little easier.”

It states that his fear of persecution or torture in Uganda is “hard to take seriously, especially given that you have claimed (through your attorneys) that you fear persecution or torture in at least 22 different countries. ... Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini.”

Human rights groups have documented violations and abuses in Uganda — as well as in Eswatini, a tiny African kingdom formerly known as Swaziland.

Eswatini’s government spokesperson told the Associated Press on Saturday that it had received no communication regarding Abrego Garcia’s transfer there.

The Salvadoran man lived in Maryland for more than a decade before he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year. That set off a series of contentious court battles that have turned his case into a test of the limits of President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies.

Although Abrego Garcia immigrated to the U.S. illegally around 2011 as a teenager, he has an American wife and child. A 2019 immigration court order barred his deportation to his native El Salvador, finding he had a credible fear of threats from gangs there. He was deported anyway in March — in what a government attorney said was an administrative error — and held in the country’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.

Facing a court order, the Trump administration returned him to the U.S. in June only to charge him with human smuggling based on a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Though that court case is ongoing, ICE now seeks to deport him again. Abrego Garcia, who denies the charges, is requesting asylum in the United States.

He was denied asylum in 2019 because his request came more than a year after he arrived in the U.S., his attorney Simon Sandoval-Mosenberg has said. Since he was deported and has now reentered the U.S., the attorney said, he is now eligible for asylum.

“If Mr. Abrego Garcia is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there’s no way he’s not going to prevail on his claim,” he said in an emailed statement.

As part of his asylum claim, Abrego Garcia expressed a fear of deportation to Uganda and “nearly two dozen” other countries, according to an ICE court filing in opposition to reopening his asylum case. That Thursday filing also states that if the case is reopened, the 2019 order barring his deportation to El Salvador would become void and the government would pursue his removal to that country.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5e3d14/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2Fbd%2F17ff4c83427ab20862040761bef4%2F07158ac2c45947348013738fd52ac134.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 14:56:50.764606

“The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America — they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,” Bondi said in the statement.
Boston isn't the first major city Bondi has sued over immigration policy.
While the DOJ suit claims Boston's policy impedes federal immigration enforcement, Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director and former Boston ICE chief, recently boasted that he routinely gets tips from local police.
And in March, Wu was summoned to Washington to answer question on the city's cooperation with immigration enforcement officials before a Republican-controlled House committee.","The Trump administration filed a lawsuit against Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Police Department, saying the city's policy to cooperate with immigration enforcement officials only in criminal matters violates federal law.

The suit, filed Thursday in federal court in Boston, takes aim at the city's Trust Act, the 2014 legislation that said Boston Police will not honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals unless they face criminal charges.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called out Wu specifically in her press release announcing the lawsuit.

“The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America — they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,” Bondi said in the statement. “If Boston won’t protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.”

The mayor hit back at the Trump administration in a statement Thursday night, saying, “This unconstitutional attack on our city is not a surprise.”

Wu defended Boston as “a thriving community, the economic and cultural hub of New England, and the safest major city in the country,” and said, “this administration is intent on attacking our community to advance their own authoritarian agenda.”

Wu said Boston will “vigorously defend our laws and the constitutional rights of cities, which have been repeatedly upheld in courts across the country. We will not yield.”

The simmering threat of a DOJ lawsuit became more real last month, when Bondi send demand letters to Boston and 31 other cities and states, ordering them to expand cooperation with immigration enforcement as the administration pursues mass deportations or risk losing federal funding.

The DOJ suit alleges that Boston's Trust Act puts federal law enforcement agents in danger ""by mandating restrictions on basic information sharing"" and barring the Department of Homeland Security access to people released from Boston police custody. The suit echoes a complaint of ICE officials in Massachusetts and Washington that they must engage in ""difficult and dangerous efforts"" to arrest immigrants in neighborhoods and courthouses because local officials won't turn people over who've been released on other charges.

Boston isn't the first major city Bondi has sued over immigration policy. Both New York and Los Angeles have been called to court over their own regulations.

The Trust Act was revised in 2019 and reaffirmed in 2024. Nowhere in the act is the word ""sanctuary"" used; the Trump administration has adopted the term as a catch-all phrase for cities that don't actively assist ICE in civil immigration arrests.

While the DOJ suit claims Boston's policy impedes federal immigration enforcement, Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director and former Boston ICE chief, recently boasted that he routinely gets tips from local police.

""I have so many friends — Boston police officers, Massachusetts state troopers — who are ecstatic about what we're doing, who give us intel,"" Lyons said on the Howie Carr show last month.

Wu rejected that claim this week, telling WBUR there was no evidence Boston cops are sharing information with ICE or any other agency beyond what is permitted in the Trust Act. She also vehemently denied repeated claims by the administration that the city is harboring criminals.

""Any assertion that we're protecting or shielding criminal behavior is absolutely false,"" Wu said.

The governor offered no immediate comment on the lawsuit. State Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement said, “This baseless lawsuit is yet another desperate attempt to rope local governments into helping the Trump Administration conduct their cruel immigration crackdowns, including targeting those with no criminal record."" She said she would ""continue to support the City of Boston in defending against these attacks on our residents.”

Josh Kraft, who’s running for mayor against Wu, in a statement called it ""yet another attempt by the Trump administration to undermine the laws and values of the City of Boston and what our nation was founded on.”

He noted that courts have so far “shut down the use of the National Guard in American cities and Boston must stand in defense of our laws and communities while continuing to work with law enforcement to keep all of our residents safe.”

At a Boston City Council hearing in the South End on Thursday night, Councilor Julia Mejia told WBUR the Trump administration ""should be focusing on the economy and they should be focusing on taking care of other business — and stay out of Boston.""

And U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren condemned the lawsuit and what she described as Trump's latest power grab.

""Boston doesn't back down to bullies. Boston is one of the safest major cities in America thanks to Mayor Wu's leadership and the trust between residents and public safety officials,"" she said in a statement.

The city's policy has been a routine target of Trump administration ire since the start of the president's second term in January, with officials asserting without evidence that the regulation shields criminals from the law. In February, Trump's border czar threatened to bring ""hell"" to Boston. And in March, Wu was summoned to Washington to answer question on the city's cooperation with immigration enforcement officials before a Republican-controlled House committee. She, alongside other big-city mayors, answered hours of grilling from the panel.

""Our local community knows best,” she said of the Trust Act during the hearing. “And we can tell you in Boston, over our history, it has not been the word of presidents, or kings, or presidents who think they are kings that set what happens. It is our residents.”

The Arizona-based Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, known as FIRRP, on Friday added Honduran children to a lawsuit filed last weekend that resulted in a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of dozens of migrant children to their native Guatemala.

In a statement, the organization said it had received reports that the U.S. government will “imminently move forward with a plan to illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

FIRRP did not immediately provide the Associated Press with details about what information it had received about the possible deportation of Honduran children. The amendment to the organization’s lawsuit is sealed in federal court. The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to email requests for comment Friday and Saturday.

Over Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration attempted to remove Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in shelters or with foster care families in the U.S.

Advocates who represent migrant children in court filed lawsuits across the country seeking to stop the government from removing the children, and on Sunday a federal judge stepped in to order that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July’s arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the suit was initially filed last week.

Some children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their legal right to present their cases to an immigration judge, have access to legal counsel and be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/98c8d39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5235x2748+0+371/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fd1%2F0fd262d747ca975b634a581a1059%2F7d734ed1f67641b1afd2e80360a1d6d5.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 13:57:21.728747

According to reporting from the HuffPost, since Trump took office, nearly 150,000 federal workers have been laid off.
“Our lawyers have the power to support federal workers and protect the stability and integrity of federal institutions,” Chu said.
But federal judges have already blocked the Trump administration from laying off federal workers, citing a number of legal reasons.","Now, public sentiment may be catching up.

A July 11 Forbes/IPSOS poll found that 62% of Americans disapprove of current immigration policies, including 65% of independents and nearly a third of Republicans.

While many still support border enforcement, the poll shows growing discomfort with workplace raids and family detentions. More than half now say immigrants strengthen the country, a notable shift from views during Trump's first term. The data suggests Americans increasingly favor reform that balances security with fairness.

This article builds on three economic arguments that together offer a roadmap for understanding and acting on this moment of clarity.

Three Economic Arguments for Immigration Reform

The case for immigration rests on three economic fundamentals that polling suggests Americans increasingly understand:

Demographics: America's aging population and below-replacement birthrates mean immigration is the only reason the U.S. workforce continues growing, and population growth is essential for sustained economic vitality. Countries like China and Russia are already in steep demographic decline.

Essential workforce: Immigrants work in key sectors the country depends on—agriculture, elder care, construction, logistics—often while facing deportation or legal limbo.

Fiscal impact: Millions of immigrants pay into Social Security and Medicare but are ineligible for benefits, helping stabilize programs that would otherwise face insolvency sooner. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, undocumented workers contributed $25 billion to Social Security in 2022 despite being ineligible for benefits unless they gain legal status.

Together, these factors show immigration as a primary engine sustaining U.S. population growth, the uncredited stabilizer of Social Security, and the invisible backbone of entire sectors from elder care to construction. What once seemed like long-term concerns now read as an immediate policy blueprint that the public may be ready to support.

Addressing the Fairness Concern

A fundamental question lies at the heart of the immigration debate. Millions have entered or remained in the U.S. without legal status, a civil violation. At the same time, others have waited for years, following the rules. What does fairness look like? Any serious conversation about reform must grapple with that tension, not to dismiss it, but to resolve it in a way that strengthens both the rule of law and the national interest.

That reform must acknowledge this concern directly. The current system has created two groups waiting for the same outcome through different paths. Some have waited years in their home countries for legal visas. Others have waited years inside the United States without legal status. Both deserve recognition, but neither should be punished for decades of system failures.

Legal recognition for undocumented immigrants cannot be automatic. It should require meeting specific conditions over multiple years: continuous employment or education enrollment, payment of back taxes and ongoing obligations, English language progress, established community ties, and a clean criminal record. Status would remain provisional with regular check-ins and possible revocation for non-compliance.

Meanwhile, the legal immigration system must function properly. Families are separated and employers are underserved because of outdated visa caps, bureaucratic delays, and inconsistent processing caused by congressional inaction and administrative neglect.

The alternative to comprehensive reform is continued dysfunction. Mass deportation would be economically damaging, socially destabilizing, and unlikely to succeed at scale. A reformed system addressing both legal and undocumented populations simultaneously may not satisfy every camp. Still, it's the only path that strengthens the rule of law, serves the national interest, and treats people with dignity.

Building Bipartisan Momentum

The polling shift creates an opening for cross-party action that hasn't existed in years. With 65 percent of independents and nearly a third of Republicans disapproving of current policies, multiple constituencies offer paths forward.

The business community provides the clearest opportunity. Chamber of Commerce groups in red states advocate for expanded guest worker programs. Texas, Florida, and Georgia business leaders voice concerns about labor shortages threatening operations. Fiscal conservatives find appeal in the Social Security angle—immigrants paying into a system they cannot access represents deficit reduction without new taxes. Local Republican officials, from mayors to county commissioners, face practical workforce shortage impacts and cannot afford to lose tax revenue.

History shows comprehensive immigration reform can be bipartisan with serious leadership. The 2013 ""Gang of Eight"" bill passed the Senate with Republican support. Reagan's 1986 reform had broad backing because business interests lobbied for steady labor flows. The difference was presidential leadership treating immigration as a national asset rather than a partisan wedge.

What a Realistic Reform Agenda Looks Like

If the public is ready to move beyond slogans and toward real solutions, Congress should pursue comprehensive legislation that includes:

Expand legal pathways for essential workers. Create new visa categories that reflect actual labor demand in caregiving, construction, agriculture, logistics, and infrastructure. These should include both temporary and permanent options, with clear pathways between them based on employer needs and worker qualifications.

Establish earned legal recognition with firm requirements. Undocumented individuals who have been in the U.S. for more than two years would be eligible to apply for provisional status after passing background checks and meeting employment, tax, and English language requirements. This status would last five years, with the possibility of renewal based on continued compliance. After a set number of years of provisional status, individuals could apply for permanent residence.

Modernize the legal immigration system. Recapture unused visas from previous years, increase annual caps to reflect economic needs, reduce processing times through technology upgrades, and create predictable timelines for all applicants. The goal should be to process most applications within 12 months, rather than the current multi-year delays.

Invest in integration support. Provide English language classes, job training, and credential recognition programs through partnerships with community colleges, unions, and employers. These programs should be funded through fees paid by participants and employers, making them self-sustaining while ensuring immigrants can contribute fully to their communities.

From Public Mood to Policy Design

The polling cited in Forbes may reflect growing public understanding that immigration, managed responsibly, strengthens America rather than weakening it. People are looking for practical solutions that address legitimate concerns while taking into account economic realities.

This represents a significant shift from the political environment of even six months ago. The challenge now is translating possible public readiness into policy action. That requires leadership that treats immigration as a national asset rather than a partisan wedge issue.

Even Ronald Reagan, in his final year in office, referred to immigration as ""a source of renewal."" The economic case for that view has only grown stronger. The underlying mathematics of demographics and fiscal policy remain the same, but the public mood has shifted.

What You Can Do Next

Public support is moving. The facts are clear. But the system will not change without sustained pressure, conversation, and leadership from every level of government and civil society.

Rather than tackling these complex issues individually, consider supporting organizations already working on comprehensive immigration reform:

Support advocacy organizations working on immigration policy reform, such as the American Immigration Council, New American Economy, or FWD.us, which focus on economic arguments and bipartisan solutions.

Engage business coalitions, such as local Chambers of Commerce, that advocate for expanded guest worker programs and address labor shortages in your region.

Connect with faith-based organizations that support immigration reform and have established networks for effective advocacy.

Contact your representatives to express support for comprehensive immigration reform, emphasizing the economic consequences of inaction rather than just moral arguments.

Stay informed and share fact-based analysis with your networks when immigration comes up in conversation.

The current moment represents a rare convergence of public opinion, economic necessity, and political opportunity. Missing this chance means accepting continued dysfunction in a system that affects every aspect of American economic life.

We have an opportunity to lead rather than simply manage a crisis. If we fail to act, history will note the silence that followed this clear public signal for change.

“We The Action is committed to expanding access to justice and delivering free legal services where they are critically needed,” Chu said.

We The Action’s website also states that they believe lawyers have the power to “do good” because of their ability to defend the nation’s values in the court of law.

Deportations or lay offs typically fall under civil legal problems, meaning they typically do not involve criminal charges but still have consequences. According to The Hague Institute for Innovation of Law, Americans have more than 150 million new civil legal problems every year, with 120 million of these going unaddressed. Other research also shows that only 14 percent of civil justice problems are taken to court or a hearing body.

Also, per the Legal Services Corporation, Americans with low income receive no or “inadequate” legal help in 92 percent of all legal problems.

Chu said We The Action works to support immigrant communities, like people seeking asylum like asylums or refugees, by finding nonprofits “defending” immigrant communities. She added that lawyers help people with the immigration system, reuniting families, and more.

One way that lawyers are connected with immigrant communities is through postings on We The Action’s website under the immigration section. Currently, postings include one from Hands United—which works to decrease the prevalence of language deprivation among hard-of-hearing children in immigrant families—for helping a Colombian family with a deaf child “fight” for asylum. Another post, by the Asian Women’s Shelter, which supports survivors of domestic violence and oppression in Asian and other communities, calls for California-based divorce and family attorneys.

“We are facing unprecedented attacks on the rule of law,” Chu said. “And despite the uncertainty this brings, We The Action’s community of lawyers are poised to meet the moment.”

Under the first Trump administration, America saw the lowest number of migrants come to approximately 411,000. When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, immigration reached its highest in the 2000s at approximately 3.3 million in 2023. Since Trump has taken office again, immigration has dropped to approximately two million as of April 2025, according to The Brookings Institution.

Within Trump’s first week of office, he increased the number of active duty troops to the southern United States border by 1,500, for a total of 4,000 troops—a 60 percent increase. Through an executive order, he also halted the processing of all undocumented migrants and asylum seekers into the U.S., among other actions.

According to the Pew Research Center, 32 percent of Americans think all immigrants illegally in the country should be deported. This is compared to 51 percent, who stated that some should be deported. And 97 percent of those individuals said someone should be deported if they previously committed a violent crime.

Chu added that with these ""unprecedented threats,” We The Action launched the Immigration Legal Response Center for volunteer lawyers to protect immigrant communities under threat.

We The Action is also supporting federal workers who have been laid off under the Trump administration’s policies. In 2025, Chu said that We The Action partnered with the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, the American Constitution Society, Democracy Forward, the Partnership for Public Service, and others to launch Rise Up: Federal Workers Legal Defense Network and connect federal workers with critical legal resources.

Rise Up gives those laid off access to free initial legal consultations with federal workers recently laid off. It also allows lawyers to sign up to volunteer and help laid-off federal workers.

According to reporting from the HuffPost, since Trump took office, nearly 150,000 federal workers have been laid off. Trump’s administration also established the Department of Government Efficiency, whose objective is to cut excess regulation and spending, modernize technology, and maximize productivity.

The LA Times also reports that the civil service system, which We The Action assists, was not set up to deal with all these layoffs in a short period of time.

“Our lawyers have the power to support federal workers and protect the stability and integrity of federal institutions,” Chu said.

But federal judges have already blocked the Trump administration from laying off federal workers, citing a number of legal reasons. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with its plan to lay off federal workers from more than 20 different agencies.

Illston wrote in her ruling that presidents do not have the authority to change federal agencies unless they have obtained approval from Congress. She also added that nine presidents over the last century have changed federal agencies only after getting approval.

Besides assisting in federal layoffs, Chu also said that We The Action advances racial justice and protects voting rights in a number of ways. Looking forward, Chu said they will continue their mission.

“We will continue to meet the moment by expanding our technology and platform, meeting needs of vulnerable communities, protecting the rule of law, and defending democracy,” Chu said.

Grainy footage of handcuffed immigrants. Soft-focus, slow-motion portraits of agents. Menacing intonations about an invasion that must be stopped at all costs. Repeated declarations of going after the “worst of the worst,” even if they’re mostly — and very clearly— not.

But ICE has now entered the cops-poaching part of their deport-a-thon.

And the latest migra ad befouling L.A.-area television stations is the most pathetic — and chilling — one yet.

“Attention law enforcement” a robotic voice announces over an opening scene of a flashing siren in what looks like a tough part of an unidentified city. The camera cuts to a blue-tinted law enforcement badge as the words, “You took an oath to protect and serve” flash on the screen. The deep-toned announcer repeats the words.

Over 30 seconds, ICE claims “dangerous illegals walk free” in cities due to sanctuary policies not allowing police and sheriff’s departments to go after them. But if you join la migra, the commercial asserts, cops can finally “catch the worst of the worst” and “join the mission to protect America.” Promises — a $50,000 signing bonus, the forgiving of student loans and “generous” benefits — pile on top of each other toward the end of the ad with a plug for ICE’s website.

“Fulfill your mission,” it concludes, Terminator-like.

Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when ... they stop coming for you — because cops decide they’re going to start chasing after a tamale lady or a gardener with three sons in the U.S. Marines.

The commercial pushes the Trumpian idea that undocumented immigrants are the ne plus ultra of criminality in this country, even though study after study over decades have shown that they’re less likely to commit crimes than American citizens. It absurdly implies that arresting actual criminals — being in this country illegally is generally a civil matter — isn’t enough for local law enforcement to consider themselves true defenders of public safety. And it suggests that ICE is the only government agency that truly lives up to the oath to protect and serve Americans.

(Insert, “Sure, Jan” GIF here.)

Tinseltown has made many great films about the exploits of cops: “L.A Confidential,” “Heat,” “Serpico,” “Training Day,” just to name a few.

But I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie where some “loose cannon” cop pops out of a Penske rental truck to grab a “bad hombre” outside Home Depot trying to make a few bucks roofing your house.

Hint to Hollywood: There’s this fella named Dean Cain just ready to be cast in that role.

ICE didn’t respond to my multiple questions about its commercial — where it’s airing, how much is it costing taxpayers and why they made an ad specifically tailored to law enforcement in the first place. The campaign launched in mid-August across the U.S. but got my attention only last week, when it began to air seemingly every hour during KCAL Channel 9’s three-hour evening news block.

La migra has been trying to hire anyone with a pulse to join them ever since Trump’s Big Bloated Bill allocated an extra $170 billion in immigration enforcement spending over the next decade. Recruitment fairs are traveling the country like some xenophobic Lollapalooza in the quest to hire 10,000 agents — they’ll be offering jobs to an army of Roombas next.

ICE’s attempted nabbing of police and sheriff’s departments for their staff isn’t making local law enforcement leaders happy.

In August, USA Today reported that ICE sent an email solicitation to deputies nationwide, leading the head of the National Sheriff’s Assn. to call the move “either galactically stupid or purposefully malicious.”

Deputy Tony Meraz, a director for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, didn’t get that email but saw ICE’s commercial on YouTube and a similarly themed billboard. He hasn’t heard of any colleagues raring to go after taqueros and flower ladies but worries that la migra’s pitch “is going to shrink our applicant pool. If it somehow seems like local law enforcement is being federalized, [being a local officer] might not attract people who might want to serve in their local community.

“I don’t want to make it political,” Meraz added, “but if [the White House] can put commercials for federal law enforcement, maybe they can subsidize local law enforcement with our hiring and recruitment and retention issues.”

That’s the underlying evil of ICE’s “Attention law enforcement” ad. Donald Trump claims he loves them — but allowing la migra try to woo cops at a time where many departments face staffing shortages makes neighborhoods more dangerous, not less. That seems no concern to Trump, who’s continuing his scheme to transform every sector of American life charged with protecting this country into a deportation machine — or else.

Take a federal judge’s recent decision deeming that Trump’s National Guard invasion of L.A. this summer was illegal and a seeming prelude to creating a “national police force.” As reported by my fellow columnista Anita Chabria, buried in the 52-page ruling was a reference to sworn testimony by the man who headed that deployment, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman. He replied “yes” when asked if U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino questioned his “loyalty to the country” after Sherman initially hesitated about leading a temporary occupation of MacArthur Park in July because it would cause chaos.

The man who ultimately approved the show of farce was Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who also ordered hundreds of Marines to occupy parts of L.A. in the wake of anti-migra protests. He recently accepted a Justice Department request to send up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges. They’re supposed to expedite the deportation of the tens of thousands of people currently in detention camps and go through millions of backlogged cases even though few of them have experience with immigration law.

I’m telling you, the Trump administration would poach Lionel Hutz from “The Simpsons” for its lawyer ranks if it helped them catapult more immigrants out of the country.

Legal experts told Anita that the move possibly runs afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from taking on domestic and immigration law enforcement. But it’s never about due process for Trump. It’s about dominion, damn the Constitution.

Trump and his masked goons claim all they want to do with their deportation deluge is to make communities safer. The irony of ICE’s cop commercial airing in Los Angeles is that if there’s a city that knows terrorizing undocumented immigrants doesn’t help to stop crime, it’s Los Angeles.

In 1979, the LAPD implemented Special Order 40, a directive that prevented officers from asking people about their immigration status in order to foster better relations with residents in the name of fighting crime. The chief who implemented it? That legendary hippie, Daryl Gates.

Special Order 40 is still in effect 46 years later and has never faced a significant internal or external revolt. Police Chief Jim McDonnell has repeatedly stressed his department wants nothing to do with playing migra even as critics point out that ICE has identified and deported people by using fingerprints that the LAPD uploads to a national database.

If law enforcement in a city with a significant population of undocumented immigrants would rather focus on catching actual criminals instead of chasing after people with no legal status, what makes ICE think they’d want to join them?

Tom Saggau, spokesperson for the union that represents LAPD officers, said he needed to “pop a Tums and get back” to me about ICE’s push, then never responded to a follow-up (try Pepto-Bismol next time!). Meraz said his members are “not concerned with the national stuff, they want to do the local and state law” — but ICE is looping them in anyway.

He and other deputies accompanied la migra “several times” over the summer during immigration raids. “They’d call us for support in the sense of ‘We’re getting overrun by protesters and bad actors — can you guys handle?’

“We don’t get into the politics,” Meraz said again. “But our people do not want to get involved in federal enforcement.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/69a1e2d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F5c%2F7207c93245b6a27053308642ae62%2F1520409-mla-me-sweater-drive-occupy-ice-la-ces-00975.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 12:56:56.169363

The Department of Homeland Security blasted a federal judge’s order preventing the Trump administration from scrapping temporary protected status for more than a million Venezuelan and Haitian nationals in the United States.

The temporary protected status, or TPS, applies to over 1 million people from the two countries, allowing them to remain in the U.S. for the time being, according to The Associated Press.

The outlet reported that it applies to 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians.

""For decades, the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program. Its use has been all the more dangerous, given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""While this order delays justice, [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,"" the statement continued. ""Under God, the people rule. Unelected activist judges cannot stop the will of the American people for a safe and secure homeland.""

Judge Edward Chen, of the Northern District of California, wrote in his ruling that ending the TPS was ""unprecedented"" and that Noem’s actions broke the law.

""This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,"" the judge wrote.

TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians was granted under the Biden administration, as the qualifiers for immigrants from a country to get the status include an active war or a major public health crisis in their homeland.

The Arizona-based Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (FIRRP) on Friday added Honduran children to a lawsuit filed last weekend that resulted in a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of dozens of migrant children to their native Guatemala.

In a statement, the organization said it had received reports that the U.S. government will “imminently move forward with a plan to illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

FIRRP did not immediately provide The Associated Press with details about what information it had received about the possible deportation of Honduran children. The amendment to the organization's lawsuit is sealed in federal court. The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to email requests for comment on Friday and Saturday.

Over Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration attempted to remove Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in shelters or with foster care families in the U.S.

Advocates who represent migrant children in court filed lawsuits across the country seeking to stop the government from removing the children, and on Sunday a federal judge stepped in to order that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July’s arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and El Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the suit was initially filed last week.

Some children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their legal right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.

“Our concern is that there is no benefit to the child to have ICE agents present at those meetings,” Lopez said.
In some cases, they have made an arrest at the sponsor appointment ORR scheduled.” Lopez said the interrogation of unaccompanied children seems to have been particularly focused on children from Guatemala and Honduras.
“Unaccompanied children should not be treated like criminals,” Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit argued.
The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the various federal agencies involved to publish all records pertaining to the alleged interrogations of the unaccompanied children and their sponsors.","The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the agency tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children, has allegedly implemented a secret policy in recent months allowing immigration agents and criminal investigators to interrogate those children and their potential U.S.-based sponsors, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week by Al Otro Lado, a San Diego-based binational organization that provides legal services and humanitarian aid to migrants.

Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accuses Health and Human Services of violating its “statutory mandate to act in the best interest of children in its care.” The lawsuit seeks to make public through the Freedom of Information Act all records pertaining to the allegedly secret policy.

“Health and Human Services has a legal obligation to act with the best interests of the child in mind,” Cassandra Lopez, Al Otro Lado’s litigation director, said in an interview Friday. “Historically, HHS hasn’t been allowed to share information about the children’s cases … with (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or with other agencies, and that’s because they’re supposed to be doing everything they can that’s in the best interest of that child, and not working to … help ICE carry out enforcement activities.”

Lopez said Al Otro Lado is aware of deportations that have occurred as a result of ICE agents interrogating unaccompanied migrant children and their potential sponsors. She said it has become a widespread practice across the U.S.

A Health and Human Services spokesperson said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not respond Friday to messages seeking comment.

Typically when an unaccompanied minor arrives at the U.S. border, the child is placed in the care of Health and Human Services, and specifically the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to the lawsuit. Health and Human Services is supposed to play no role in the apprehension or initial detention of children and by law is not a party to children’s immigration proceedings.

As soon as the Office of Refugee Resettlement takes an unaccompanied child into its care, the agency is supposed to put that child in contact with their parents, guardians or other relatives and begin a process of finding the child a suitable sponsor living in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Those sponsors are required to undergo background checks and complete an assessment process that identifies potential risks and safety concerns.

The lawsuit alleges that in recent months, ICE agents have been accompanying personnel from the Office of Refugee Resettlement during routine meetings with children and seeking to interrogate them without an attorney present. The suit contends that ICE agents have done the same with potential sponsors.

“Our concern is that there is no benefit to the child to have ICE agents present at those meetings,” Lopez said. “People are afraid of ICE. So if ICE is going to be present at those meetings, people will no longer want to be sponsors for unaccompanied children, which means kids will stay in custody, and they may be less willing to fight their immigration case or to pursue relief that they are eligible for.”

Lopez said nonprofits have been raising the alarm for months now that ICE agents and other immigration officers have been accompanying Health and Human Services personnel to routine meetings and welfare checks at sponsors’ homes.

“They’ll be there with an ICE agent who is then asking a bunch of questions about other people besides the child,” Lopez said. “ICE (also) seems to be riding along almost every time a sponsor clears the last hurdle to gain release of a child in an attempt to interrogate sponsors. In some cases, they have made an arrest at the sponsor appointment ORR scheduled.”

Lopez said the interrogation of unaccompanied children seems to have been particularly focused on children from Guatemala and Honduras.

Included in the lawsuit is an Aug. 5 email that Al Otro Lado obtained that was apparently sent by Adam Loiacono, ICE’s deputy principal legal advisor for enforcement and litigation. The email, which was sent to other ICE and DHS personnel, appears to lay out ICE’s legal justification for questioning unaccompanied migrant children at shelters operated by Health and Human Services.

The email stated that agents from Homeland Security Investigations, an agency under the DHS umbrella that’s focused on global organized crime, intended to interview unaccompanied migrant children in part as an effort to help Health and Human Services reunite the children with their families.

The email said that another goal of the interviews was to “take administrative action as appropriate … if the parent or guardian is unlawfully present in the US.” The email also stated that the children, who are entitled by law to an attorney “in legal proceedings or matters,” did not need legal counsel during the interviews with HSI agents because the interviews would not qualify as legal proceedings or matters.

Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit said the unaccompanied children, many of whom have “suffered trauma, abuse and persecution in their home countries,” are entitled to care and reunification by experienced teams dedicated to child welfare.

“Unaccompanied children should not be treated like criminals,” Al Otro Lado’s lawsuit argued.

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.
Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.
A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.
In June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states.","SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary legal protections that have granted more than 1 million people from Haiti and Venezuela the right to live and work in the United States.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco for the plaintiffs means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the United States. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians.

Chen scolded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for revoking protections for Venezuelans and Haitians that the judge said would send them ""back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries.""

He said Noem's actions were arbitrary and capricious, and she exceeded her authority in ending protections that were extended by the Biden administration.

Presidential administrations have executed the law for 35 years based on the best available information and in consultation with other agencies, ""a process that involves careful study and analysis. Until now,"" Chen wrote.

Plaintiffs and their attorneys welcomed the news Friday, although it's unclear if it would help people who have already been deported.

""In recent months, people have suffered unspeakable harm — including deportation and family separation — due to the Supreme Court greenlighting Secretary Noem's discriminatory and harmful agenda,"" said Emi Maclean, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California. ""That must end now.""

A DHS spokesperson said in an email that the program has been ""abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program"" and that ""unelected activist judges"" cannot stop the American people's desire for a secure country.

""While this order delays justice, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,"" the email read.

The second Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has resulted in ramped-up arrests of people in the country illegally, but also an end to programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in immigrants' homelands are deemed unsafe.

According to court documents, the administration has terminated Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and Humanitarian Parole designations for about 1.5 million people, prompting lawsuits across the country from immigrant advocates.

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States, if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.

Haiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.

Their designations were to expire in September but later extended until February, due to a separate court order out of New York.

Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the countries to stay on for what is a temporary program. Attorneys for the government have said the secretary's clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program are not subject to judicial review.

Designations are granted for terms of six, twelve or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.

The secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violated the law, Chen wrote.

The case has had numerous legal twists, including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In March, Chen temporarily paused the administration's plans to end TPS for people from Venezuela. An estimated 350,000 Venezuelans were set to lose protections the following month.

But the U.S. Supreme Court in May reversed his order while the lawsuit played out. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals, and did not rule on the merits of the case.

Venezuelans with expired protections were fired from jobs, separated from children, detained by officers and even deported, lawyers for TPS holders said.

A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and the Supreme Court decision.

After appearing for her annual immigration check-in, a restaurant hostess living in Indiana was deported back to Venezuela in July. Her husband, a construction company supervisor, cannot work and care for their baby daughter at the same time.

In June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states. He slept for about two weeks on a floor, terrified he would be sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. His wife cannot maintain the household on her earnings.

""I am not a criminal,"" he said in the declaration, adding that ""immigrants like myself come to the United States to work hard and contribute, and instead our families and lives are being torn apart.""

The Supreme Court's reversal does not apply to Friday's ruling. The government is expected to appeal.

Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.
“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.
Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.
“So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job.","Federal immigration authorities say they arrested dozens of South Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, marking what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest-ever raid — and triggering outrage from South Korean officials who expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.

But a search warrant seen by The Independent shows that agents were seeking the arrests of only four workers at the facility — who are Latino.

Agents arrested 475 people on Thursday at a battery facility on the sprawling Hyundai campus in Ellabell, Georgia — roughly 30 miles west of Savannah — as part of an “ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” according to Homeland Security.

A judge approved the warrant following a months-long investigation, according to Steve Schrank, a special agent in charge of Homeland Securities Investigations Atlanta. Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.

No criminal charges were announced, but Schrank said many of the factory’s workers were living and working in the United States without legal permission.

The massive operation targeted a sprawling, 3,000-acre complex in a state under Republican leadership, which has hailed the $7.6 billion Hyundai Motor Group investment as one of the state’s largest economic development projects in its history.

South Korea's biggest automaker began manufacturing electric vehicles at the plant last year, which employs more than 1,000 people. LG Energy Solution operates an adjacent battery plant set to open next year.

But Donald Trump’s administration did not appear to give its key ally any advance notice of the operation, which caught Seoul by surprise.

The country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong expressed “concerns and regret” following news of the arrests and urged “special attention to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens are not violated.""

“The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,” the ministry said following news of the arrests.

Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.

Responding to questions at the White House about whether his anti-immigration agenda is clashing with his efforts to pull billions of dollars of foreign investment into the economy, Trump said “they were illegal aliens” and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “was just doing its job.”

He wants to “get along with other countries, and we want to have a great, stable workforce,” he said in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday.

“And we had, as I understand it, a lot of illegal aliens, some not the best of people, but we had a lot of illegal aliens working there,” he said. “So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job. That’s what they have to do.”

In a statement, Hyundai said the company is “closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.”

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company said.

With a directive from the White House to make thousands of daily arrests, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has received record-breaking funding from Congress — expanding the agency’s budget to be larger than most countries’ militaries — to hire more officers and expand detention space.

The Trump administration has deployed federal agents across the country to support his aggressive mass deportation agenda with large-scale arrests and sweeps targeting major Democratic-led cities with large immigrant populations. A record 60,000 people are currently locked up in immigration detention centers across the country.

The administration has directed all federal law enforcement agencies to converge around immigration enforcement, drawing warnings from immigration attorneys and advocates that those arrest quotas will almost certainly include “collateral” arrests of citizens and others with lawful immigration status.

The country’s labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants within the first seven months of the year, including people who are in the country without legal permission, according to an analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data from the Pew Research Center.

That massive reduction has affected industries with large populations of foreign-born workers, including farming, construction and home healthcare.

Roughly 92 percent of construction companies reported project delays due to workforce shortages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/f8bc60db09c9e0da0c79415a96b5ce31,N,,2025-09-06 13:57:16.539326

Dinesh Tandon, who owns the Indian restaurant Indigo with his wife, said delivery sales have dropped about 30% in recent weeks.
In Mount Pleasant, another restaurant owner reported profits plunging by 60% because of the shortage of delivery drivers.","Yakson had a delivery to pick up in Washington, DC’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood, but first he scanned the street for immigration officers. A white truck parked nearby looked suspicious. He lingered, peering through the truck window for signs of an agent. Only when it seemed clear did he dart inside the restaurant, rushing the pickup.

“People are scared,” he told CNN, his eyes still on the truck.

The Trump administration’s move to surge federal law enforcement into Washington, DC, has reshaped the daily rhythms of immigrant life in the nation’s capital. With ICE now riding alongside local police, many food delivery drivers – a workforce that includes many Venezuelan migrants – say they no longer feel safe waiting on street corners for orders.

Some have switched from mopeds to bikes to avoid attention or potential stops for traffic violations, while others have left the city altogether, leaving local businesses struggling with delayed orders, vanishing customers, and steep drops in sales. Dozens of delivery drivers in DC used to gather outside businesses while waiting for their phones to “ping” to signal the next pickup. Street corners that once pulsed with salsa, reggaetón and lively chatter have fallen silent since the start of Trump’s law enforcement push in the capital.

CNN has reported that in the first two weeks of Trump’s crackdown last month, there was a more than tenfold increase over the typical ICE arrest numbers for the district. Many residents in migrant-heavy neighborhoods now worry about being picked up by ICE, with delivery drivers especially fearful.

‘Just let us work’

José, a delivery driver from Venezuela, told CNN that he changed from a moped to a bike to lessen the chances of being targeted.

“I have my wife and two children back in Venezuela (that I send money to) and bills (here) still need to be paid,” said José, who declined to share his last name.

José left Venezuela two years ago in search of a better future amid the country’s ongoing political and economic crisis, which has deepened under the country’s increasingly authoritarian government.

He told CNN being a delivery driver was his way to make ends meet. He said that after the law enforcement push in DC, his income has gone down.

“It’s hard, it’s very hard,” said José when discussing the current work environment.

During the Biden administration, thousands of Venezuelans were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), giving them work authorization and protection from deportation. The Trump administration has moved to end TPS.

Another driver, who’s been in Washington, DC, for three years, told CNN he has witnessed arrests that he considered unfair. “Not everyone does bad things – people deserve respect as human beings,” he said.

He added that many drivers have stopped showing up given the current climate.

“I’ve seen fewer delivery drivers on the streets because people are afraid of being deported. If someone does wrong, fine, apply the law. But those who work hard every day deserve the chance to keep working,” he said.

A different delivery driver, who asked to remain anonymous, had a simple plea: “Just let us work.”

“There is a lot of fear,” she continued. Two years ago, she fled Venezuela with her young daughter and sister amid the country’s political and social turmoil. “It’s a disaster,” she said of her homeland.

She began working as a delivery driver six months ago, drawn by the flexible hours that allowed her to earn an income while caring for her daughter.

Her sister, also a delivery driver, shares the same fear. If anything were to happen to either of them, she worries her daughter would be left alone, with no other family in the United States to turn to.

“I’m sad, scared, depressed — I don’t go into DC anymore. None of the women (who are) delivery drivers do; we all have young children,” she said. “My sales have dropped, and I’m still supporting my parents and grandmother back in Venezuela. My grandmother is very sick, and I help take care of all of them.”

Growing fears and declining sales

Some of the moped delivery drivers are Venezuela migrants who arrived in DC in 2022, bused in from Texas. They sought work and found that food delivery for the apps was not only an in-demand, steady job, but easy to get approved.

Delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub have varying requirements for their couriers. Some demand Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, while others only ask for a government-issued ID – a gap that’s made certain platforms more accessible to immigrant workers.

Video captured by a Washington Post reporter of one recent arrest of a moped driver went viral on social media. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the moped driver had come to the US illegally from Venezuela and had an order of removal from an immigration judge.

Leavitt has defended the federalization of DC, saying the administration is committed on making the nation’s city “safe and beautiful again.”

But immigration advocates say the change has fueled a climate of anxiety among food delivery workers. “A big fear is just being stopped and assumed to be undocumented – whether they are or not – and then getting arrested,” said Catherine Rubio of the Central American Resource Center. “There’s this fear that because they’re moped drivers, they’ll be targeted.”

Feeling unsafe in the city, some delivery workers have shifted to Maryland or Virginia, while others abandoned delivery work entirely and are now struggling to pay rent and bills, according to Amy Fisher, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid.

Some businesses have also taken a hit.

Dinesh Tandon, who owns the Indian restaurant Indigo with his wife, said delivery sales have dropped about 30% in recent weeks. “Earlier, orders were picked up instantly, without delays. Now we wait for drivers – sometimes they don’t even show up,” he told CNN. In Mount Pleasant, another restaurant owner reported profits plunging by 60% because of the shortage of delivery drivers.

In nearby Columbia Heights, Latino-owned businesses describe kitchens being short-staffed after workers were arrested, while longtime customers now avoid the neighborhood’s commercial corridors. One supermarket employee said his hours were cut to just two or three days a week, and that several coworkers had already been arrested.

Hector, a business owner in Mount Pleasant who declined to give his last name but goes by “El Dominicano,” said, “My sales have gone down, as you can see,” gesturing to his nearly empty coffee shop.

“We had just opened, but since ICE started showing up in the neighborhood, people are scared – not just Latinos, but Americans as well,” he said.

When asked if he personally feels the impact, one Venezuelan driver turned to his faith. “I believe God is stronger than everything. He gives and takes away power.

The Fourth Amendment protects citizens against arbitrary searches and arrests and serves as the basis of search warrants with a probable cause of crime. The resolution directs city staff to “uphold the 4th amendment at their workplace and city agencies and report back to Council any barriers to effective training on the 4th Amendment for any departments.”

The resolution says the city has “historically pursued equity and safety for all residents” and the trust of Durhamites is essential to the city carrying out its operations. It says the threat of “unconstitutional seizure” has prevented immigrants in Durham from “safely engaging in public life, including pursuing employment and education.”

The move comes less than two months after four ICE agents appeared at the Durham County Courthouse to detain an undocumented individual charged with felony. The officers donning plain clothes did not arrest anyone, but their presence sounded alarms among Durham residents and council members alike.

“Our residents witnessed ICE agents in our community, instilling widespread fear and uncertainty,” Mayor of Durham Leo Williams said of the event. “While local leaders cannot legally override the federal government’s use and weaponization of ICE, we can and must stand in strategic solidarity with our neighbors.” That same day, Durhamites organized a peaceful demonstration and march from the Durham County Courthouse against immigration enforcement.

The Fourth Amendment Workplace resolution was introduced by council member Javiera Caballero and supported by Siembra NC, an organization that supports Latino immigrant workers across North Carolina. Notably, Siembra NC also organized the rally for Duke bus driver Luis Alonso Juárez, who is at risk of losing his legal status in the U.S. after the Trump administration ended Temporary Protected Status for Hondurans.

Durham is the second city to pass such a resolution, with Carrboro being the first in the Triangle to enact a Fourth Amendment Workplace resolution in May.

At the council meeting, various Durhamites spoke in support of the increased protections to immigrants.

“Durham celebrates a rich diversity of residents and we understand that the Trump administration’s mass deportation targets a completely manufactured panic surrounding immigrants, puts anyone who does not appear white, anyone who does not speak English or has an accent, anyone regardless of papers or immigration status, at risk of abuse, abduction and even deportation to country they have no ties to,” said Elise Ballan, chair of the Durham Workers’ Rights commission.

Several immigrants and their families spoke in favor of the resolution, sharing stories of their anxieties in day-to-day life.

The passage of the resolution marks a win in the Durham community’s efforts against ICE presence in the city.

In February, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers arrested 11 Durham residents they identified as “illegal aliens.” It was not clear whether the 11 detainees had search warrants against them. Durham residents with immigrant backgrounds said they were concerned about the safety of their family members and resorted to advocacy hotlines and local community organizations like Siembra NC for support.

Durham was listed a “sanctuary county” in April by the Department of Health and Homeland Security for allegedly failing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. County officials have since rejected that label and said the designation had “no legal or factual basis.”

The North Carolina General Assembly overrode Governor Josh Stein’s veto of the controversial House Bill 10, which directs local sheriffs to comply with federal immigration agents. In an Aug. 31 candidate forum, Mayor Pro Tempore Mark Anthony Middleton said that he would never support Durham Police Department collaborating with ICE in any fashion.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status.
The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud, or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press.

While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services such as prescription drugs and specialty care.

The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.

“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”

The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. without authorization off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics, and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois, and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.

At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.

“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud, and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”

Trump targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country without authorization.

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.

Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.

Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.

“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.

California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.

As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs, and dental care.

Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.

“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud, and abuse very seriously.”

It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.

California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.

Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.

And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”

“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”

Immigrants’ Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis, and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.

“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

In an email to the Maryland man, which was obtained by CNN, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said that given Abrego Garcia's concerns about being deported to several other countries, they now seek to remove him to Eswatini. The Department of Homeland Security previously notified Abrego Garcia of plans to deport him to Uganda, but he objected to the removal, citing fears of being persecuted or tortured.

""That claim of fear is hard to take seriously, especially given that you have claimed (through your attorneys) that you fear persecution or torture in at least 22 different countries,"" read the email, which listed the countries, including his home country of El Salvador, where he spent weeks in a notorious mega prison earlier this year after he was mistakenly deported.

""Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa,"" the email added.

An ICE official confirmed that Abrego Garcia will be deported to Eswatini, telling CNN, ""TRUE: An immigration judge ordered him removed and ICE will comply with that order.""

Abrego Garcia is currently in ICE custody after being brought back to the US to face human smuggling charges, but the Trump administration is trying to quickly deport him again, even before the trial concludes.

Last week, the federal judge overseeing Abrego Garcia's case ruled that he cannot be deported until at least early October, after Trump administration officials are expected to testify about the government's efforts to re-deport him.

Abrego Garcia has said he prefers to be sent to Costa Rica, a country that has said it would be willing to give him some form of legal status should he be sent there.

The administration previously offered to eventually deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in exchange for a guilty plea, his lawyers told the judge overseeing his human trafficking case last month. However, Abrego Garcia did not accept the offer, according to a source familiar with his case.

Eswatini - formerly known as Swaziland - is located in Southeast Africa and is roughly the size of New Jersey. Governed by a monarch who has absolute power, Eswatini is one of four African countries that have struck a deal with the Trump administration to receive foreign deportees, along with Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.

Abrego Garcia is also separately seeking to renew his bid for asylum, a process that will play out before an immigration judge within the Justice Department.

After launching aggressive immigration raids that drew clashes with the public, Trump declared an emergency, controversially deploying the National Guard and U.S. Marines.
“If we didn’t send out the National Guard — Los Angeles would be burning right now!” Trump insisted over Truth Social at the time.
But he said sending in National Guard troops would not accomplish that.","CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker set in motion a campaign against federal intervention in his state more than a week ago.

Before immigration agents descended on Chicago and the threat of a National Guard deployment loomed, there was Pritzker, showing off the city on social media and in TV interviews. One interviewfeatured him walking on a sunlit path along Lake Michigan, and another had him sitting in a restaurant in the city’s Little Village neighborhood. This week, he staged a news conference in front of a Chicago River teeming with summer tourists and Trump’s hotel prominent in the background.

Pritzker and his team were laying out an intentional visual record. Their strategy was to stock national media with footage of a typical day in Chicago to show it was far from the “worst and most dangerous city in the World,” as President Donald Trump has proclaimed on his Truth Social platform.

“The president’s absurd characterizations do not match what is happening on the ground here. He has no idea what he’s talking about,” Pritzker told reporters this week. “There is no emergency that warrants deployment of troops. He is insulting the people of Chicago by calling our home a hellhole — and anyone who takes his word at face value is insulting Chicagoans, too.”

Pritzker’s tack is the latest employed by Democratic leaders from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., to Baltimore who have become the target of a White House that has threatened to send — or has already sent — National Guard troops into their states.

In Chicago, Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have made clear that the Trump administration slashed public safety funding, including canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in grants, with specific impacts on anti-violence programs in the city, even as it is calling for law enforcement escalation. Johnson also criticized red states for lax laws that he said enable the flow of guns into his city.

Johnson laid out examples of Chicago working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to get guns off the streets.

“My question is: Why did Trump cut $468 million from the ATF’s budget in his nasty signature bill? Why did he cut funding for the agency responsible for getting guns off our streets by almost 30%?” Johnson said at a news conference.

Though crime is down in the cities Trump has targeted, Democrats have been faced with the unpopular prospect of appearing to downplay the issue and rejecting federal assistance. But as the clashes have escalated in recent weeks, Democratic leaders have fine-tuned their messages.

This week, Trump suggested he could send National Guard troops to New Orleans, noting that Louisiana’s Republican governor would be compliant. Some Democrats saw that as a sign that their focus on Trump only targeting blue states was working.

“You do see our governors leading and pushing back with the right approach,” said Josh Marcus-Blank, a Democratic strategist. “None of them are saying crime is fixed.”

In the case of Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser — who does not have jurisdiction over the city in the way a governor does over a state — has engaged in a delicate balancing act of collaborating with Trump’s administration while reassuring a disapproving city council that she was not kowtowing to it.

Bowser cooperated with the White House as National Guard troops arrived. She acknowledged that crime dropped after the deployment and noted she and the city “greatly appreciate the surge of officers.”

Her posture at times was viewed as sidling up to the Trump administration, but Bowser clarified in subsequent remarks that she was attempting to find an exit strategy for the National Guard occupation.

“Our North Star is protecting home rule and the district’s autonomy,” she said. “What hasn’t worked, in my opinion, and hasn’t been efficient and is not on mission is National Guard troops, especially from other states.”

D.C. is now challenging the White House’s move in the courts.

Democratic strategist Mike Nellis noted Bowser’s situation stood out from those of other mayors.

“Thanking Donald Trump is like thanking Tony Soprano for protection you never asked for. But she’s in a very precarious position,” Nellis said. “Playing along and keeping her city safe is the smartest move for her — he and the Republican Congress can just slash whatever they want.”

It is unclear what Trump’s next move is, given a court ruling earlier this week calling his deployment of the National Guard and the Marines in Los Angeles illegal.

“We’re going in,” Trump told reporters of Chicago, even after the ruling on Los Angeles.

That legal fight was just one way California Gov. Gavin Newsom has combated Trump’s deployment of federal law enforcement in his city since June.

After launching aggressive immigration raids that drew clashes with the public, Trump declared an emergency, controversially deploying the National Guard and U.S. Marines. Soon, scenes of burning vehicles and looting dominated TV coverage.

“If we didn’t send out the National Guard — Los Angeles would be burning right now!” Trump insisted over Truth Social at the time. The clashes transpired over about five blocks, or 0.01% of Los Angeles County.

Newsom went on his own campaign against Trump, accusing the president of engaging in authoritarianism, challenging him in court, posting photos of National Guard members sleeping on the floor, and ensuring the public knew it was footing the $120 million bill for the deployment.

In one prominent moment, Newsom addressed Californians in a formal speech that was carried live. He laid out how the situation unraveled, citing the immigration raids, the protests that followed and the deployment of the National Guard, whose use of rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades he said only served to escalate it all.

“What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before,” Newsom said at the time. “This brazen abuse of power by a sitting president inflamed a combustible situation, putting our people, our officers and the National Guard at risk.”

There were immediate signs of a hunger for the pushback. Social media posts of Newsom’s full nine-minute speech were viewed more than 40 million times in less than a week, according to the governor’s office.

As he braces for what’s next in his state, Pritzker has sought to portray Trump’s impending action as overreach, including the president’s contention that Pritzker should call him and ask for the National Guard to be called to Chicago to deal with violence.

“When did we become a country where it’s OK for a U.S. president to insist on national television that a state should call him to beg for anything? Especially something you don’t want,” Pritzker said this week, referring to a potential National Guard deployment as an “invasion.” “Have we truly lost all sense of sanity in this nation that we treat this as normal?”

For Pritzker, reality has clashed with his strategy. Just after he recorded an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation” in Little Village, two people were shot in that heavily Latino neighborhood, one fatally. And over Labor Day weekend, nearly 60 people were shot in the city, again drawing the kinds of violence-laden headlines the governor and Chicago mayor were trying to avoid. Crime is down significantly this year, however. A WBEZ analysis found that this summer, Chicago had the fewest murders since 1965.

“I don’t want to hear another damn word from either one of them that everything’s OK, that we can handle this on our own,” Chicago City Council member Raymond Lopez said of Pritzker and Johnson. “Because what I’m hearing from them is that they have an acceptable loss of life expected from Chicagoans that I do not agree with.”

Brian Hopkins, who heads the Chicago City Council’s public safety panel, said the city would thrive with a boost in federal resources and agency coordination. But he said sending in National Guard troops would not accomplish that.

“It should be obvious to anyone involved that their true intentions are not to assist us, but they’re to embarrass us. They’re to score political points at our expense, and they’re using law enforcement tools as a pawn in their game,” Hopkins said. “It’s despicable and offensive and unconstitutional and wrong.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250902-JB-Pritzker-aa-121-1b838e.jpg",N,,2025-09-06 13:57:03.493981

Senior U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, a Barack Obama appointee, on Friday granted a motion for summary judgment from the National TPS Alliance, an immigrant advocacy group.

Noem’s decision, Chen said, would have returned migrants to “conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel.” He called Noem’s actions unprecedented and illegal.

In a statement to Courthouse News, a DHS spokesperson said that Noem will use “every legal option at the Department’s disposal” to end what they called “chaos” over the TPS program.

“For decades, the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,"" the spokesperson said. “Its use has been all the more dangerous given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country.”

A representative for the National TPS Alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Created by the 1990 Immigration Act, temporary protected status is offered to people from certain countries where violence or economic duress would make their deportation difficult or unsafe.

About 600,000 Venezuelans were given TPS under the Biden administration, making them the largest TPS demographic in the country.

Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden issued an extension for those whose status was running out. Noem revoked the extension as soon as she took office.

In February, Noem also revoked status for Haitian immigrants. There are about 500,000 Haitians in the United States who benefit from TPS.

In their lawsuit, migrants and the National TPS Alliance claimed Noem’s actions were motivated by racial animus and violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

In March, Chen postponed Noem’s decision after determining that racial animus was indeed a likely factor. There’s never been such a revocation in the 35-year history of the TPS program. Then, in a one-page decision without explanation in May, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed Chen’s ruling.

In oral arguments on Aug. 1, the National TPS Alliance argued that in her haste to undo protections granted by the Biden administration, Noem sidestepped review requirements. The group argues she then fabricated reasons to justify her decision.

“It’s not a blank slate for her to decide whatever she wants,” Jessica Bansal, an attorney representing the alliance, said. “This is a statute that is designed to provide some measure of insulation against political changes to humanitarian refugees in this country.”

William Weiland, a Justice Department lawyer, said Noem considered the conditions in Venezuela as part of her decision.

“What they are asking you to do is weigh or reweigh"" that decision, Weiland told the judge.

On Aug. 25, Chen issued a temporary stay pending a ruling by the Ninth Circuit.

Four days later, the Ninth Circuit affirmed Chen’s postponement order. A panel said Noem lacked authority to end the Biden-era extension of TPS for Venezuelans.

“The TPS statute is designed to constrain the executive, creating predictable periods of safety and legal status for TPS beneficiaries,"" U.S. Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw, a Bill Clinton appointee, wrote for the panel.

In a separate lawsuit, the National TPS Alliance is also challenging the Trump administration’s revocation of protections for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/127.0.0.1/2023/03/kristi-noem.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-09-06 09:56:32.255030

The move came after Congress authorized expanding immigration detention and enforcement amid a crackdown inside courtrooms and at immigration check-ins.
For months now, those inside the immigration courts system have been pressed to implement Trump Administration policies.
That status expired on April 2 after the Trump administration terminated the program, a decision that is also tied up in litigation.
“This now solidifies that as the law of the land, unless and until [the] federal circuit court rules otherwise.”","A Trump administration policy to deny bond hearings to immigrants who entered the country without authorization was upheld by an immigration appellate board Friday, expanding mandatory detention to thousands of people already behind bars and potentially millions more nationwide.

Although the policy is being challenged in federal court, the ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals is likely to send an immediate chill through immigration courts where judges for decades have released individuals on bond whom they did not deem a flight risk or danger.

Those judges are now bound by the board’s decision. Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch but fall under the Department of Justice.

Immigrant rights attorneys say holding immigrants throughout their cases — a process that can sometimes take years — is intended to break the spirit of many and force them to sign their own deportation orders.

“This is an effort to increase the number of people in detention significantly,” said Niels W. Frenzen, director of the USC Gould School of Law Immigration Clinic, who is part of a team of attorneys who have filed habeas petitions for dozens of immigrants picked up during the summer raids in Los Angeles.

“Literally millions of people are now subject to being held without bond,” he said.

One of those is Ana Franco Galdamez, a mother of two U.S. citizens who has been in the country for two decades. She was getting treatment for breast cancer when she was arrested in a June 19 raid in Los Angeles County, where nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants reside, according to estimates.

She was denied bond and missed treatment, but she was eventually released after a lawyer filed a habeas case.

“Detention conditions are horrific, and they’ve gotten even worse,” Frenzen said. “The goal of the administration is to make it difficult for people to fight their cases and to give up.”

Federal judges have ruled in several cases that denying bond violated federal statues and constitutionally protected due process. The group is now seeking to block the no-bond policy in a class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Other lawsuits are also pending.

The Trump administration introduced the no-bond policy nationally in a memo in July — paving the way for the mandatory detention of immigrants.

The move came after Congress authorized expanding immigration detention and enforcement amid a crackdown inside courtrooms and at immigration check-ins.

Immigrants, most of whom had been following the rules to adjust, maintain or gain legal status, were arrested and detained.

For months now, those inside the immigration courts system have been pressed to implement Trump Administration policies. Judges have been fired, and the Pentagon has said it is identifying military lawyers and judges to temporarily sit on the bench.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts, did not answer specific questions from The Times — but pointed out that the ruling was a precedent.

“It strips judicial discretion in many cases,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “It basically says, if you entered illegally, only ICE can decide if you get out of detention.”

The Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision stems from the case of a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the border in November 2022 near El Paso, Texas, and was later granted temporary protected status. That status expired on April 2 after the Trump administration terminated the program, a decision that is also tied up in litigation.

The board determined that immigration judges had no authority to issue bonds because immigrants “who are present in the United States without admission ... must be detained for the duration of their removal proceedings.”

In other words, the board’s decision treats people who have been in the U.S. for years the same as newly arriving immigrants at the border, who can be quickly deported without bond.

“We’ve had clients that are pregnant, we’ve had clients that are breastfeeding. We’ve had clients who have never been arrested, let alone commit, convicted of any crime ever, who’ve never missed an ICE check in — they’re all being told, ‘You’re subject to mandatory detention because of this new interpretation by the Trump administration,’” said Jordan Wells, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area. “This now solidifies that as the law of the land, unless and until [the] federal circuit court rules otherwise.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4474f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6051x3177+0+430/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F28%2F87bc0f50449f9db96dc4ba93022b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2219062487,N,,2025-09-06 09:56:36.079020

I’m Al Letson. There have been videos circulating lately that I just can’t get out of my mind. Speaker 2:If you have an ID and a [inaudible 00:00:12] of course you can take her. Speaker 3:Excuse me. Speaker 4:Oh, oh, no, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Al Letson:One shows this petite young woman holding onto a tree, gripping it with everything she has, while this older man, a guy with silver, gray hair, grabs her arm twisting it behind her back. Speaker 4:Are you kidding me, old man? Speaker 2:What you’re doing is (beep) illegal. Speaker 4:What you’re doing is kidnapping. What you’re doing is [inaudible 00:00:33]. Al Letson:The older guy has a mask on, he’s wearing black sunglasses, he’s got a gun and a utility belt but no uniform. And he’s using everything he has to try and peel the woman off that tree. Speaker 4:What you’re doing is [inaudible 00:00:47]. What the (beep) is wrong with you? Get the (beep) back. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Al Letson:She must understand, this is a losing battle for her, but she’s holding on for dear life. The older guy isn’t alone, there are others, they have guns and they’re also wearing masks. Speaker 4:They’re kidnapping her. Speaker 5:[Inaudible 00:01:03]. Al Letson:Eventually, the masked people get the woman off the tree and manage to push her into the back of an SUV. Her red apron stays on during the whole ordeal. She’s wearing an apron because she’d been selling food by a Home Depot when federal agents chased her down and arrested her. According to ICE, the woman is a migrant without legal status in the US. Arrests and confrontations like this one are surging across the country. Donald Trump:We will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. Speaker 7:A shocking ICE arrest was caught on video. Speaker 8:Now on the ground, on the ground. Speaker 9:[inaudible 00:01:45] Speaker 10:Protests are breaking out in response. Speaker 11:President Trump has a clear message for those that are in our country illegally. Leave now. Speaker 12:Stay indoors when possible and know your rights. Do not go out unless necessary. Stay at home and do not open the door to strangers. Al Letson:There are roughly 60,000 people in ICE detention according to NBC. Less than a third of them have criminal convictions. Speaker 13:No, Mummy. Speaker 14:They just smashed the window of that SUV and then they forced this man out of the car onto the ground. Al Letson:ICE is arresting people in front of their kids at school drop-offs, on the way to church, and at routine check-ins at immigration offices. And it’s only the beginning. The Trump administration’s mega spending bill will grow ICE’s budget from $8 billion a year to nearly 28 billion. More than many large nations spend on their entire military. ICE raids are remaking the country. Speaker 15:New census data shows that the foreign-born population in the US has declined by 2.2 million people from January to July. That’s the biggest six month drop on record. Al Letson:The thing is, those numbers, they’re not just numbers. Every single one of them is a person. For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have tried and failed to pass the kinds of immigration reforms that could have created a pathway for many of these folks to remain here legally. Instead, they’ve been vanishing with little to no due process. Who are they? And what happens to the family, jobs, and communities they leave behind? We begin at Loganville High School in the suburbs of Atlanta. In May, the school held its graduation ceremony. There were speeches from the valedictorian and the principal. An impressive rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner. And of course, the handing out of diplomas. Speaker 16:Say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light. Al Letson:But one graduate wasn’t there to receive his. Josue Trejo Lopezz had been deported just two weeks before the ceremony, along with his brother. Producer, Katie Mingle, has the story. Katie Mingle:Let me introduce you to these brothers. There’s Josue, the graduate, and his brother, Jose, who’s older, but just by a year. Their mom wanted them to have similar names they told me because she always liked the idea of having twins. She also had them wearing matching outfits all through their childhood and well into their adolescence. Until finally it occurred to them that it might be nice not to do this anymore. Jose Trejo Lopez:We were like, “You know what? Why are we dressing the same?” Katie Mingle:This is Jose, he’s the older one. Jose Trejo Lopez:And I told my brother I want to dress differently than you, I don’t want people to see that we are wearing the same shoes, the same shirt, the same pair of pants. I want to have a different style. It was around the age of 15 to 16. And I told my mom and she was like, “Okay, that’s fine, if that’s what you want, you can do it.” So my mom started buying different type of clothes. It was the same, but it was a different color at least. At least it was a different color, we were not looking the same. Katie Mingle:Now the brothers are 19 and 20 and they look different. Jose has glasses and Josue doesn’t. Josue has recently been sporting a long handlebar mustache that Jose is always telling him to trim. But still they’re very close. Josue Trejo Lopez:Like something happens to him, well, I will care about it, I’m there for him. And something happens to me, he’s there for me. Katie Mingle:That’s Josue. And Jose has something to add. Jose Trejo Lopez:Well, what he’s basically trying to say is that we are really supportive to one another. I would call our brother relationship like best friends. We are always together. And if I buy a pair of shoes and he doesn’t buy one, I don’t buy mine because I’m like, “You know what? I feel bad.” Katie Mingle:Josue and Jose left El Salvador with their mom when they were 10 and 11. It was 2016, and El Salvador had recently recorded the highest murder rate of any country in the western hemisphere. Jose told me gang members had started approaching kids at school offering them cell phones to join up. The boys’ mom wanted to bring her sons to a place where they’d be safer and have a chance at a better future. Plus a lot of their relatives were already in the US. So the family took a long journey through Guatemala and Mexico, crossing the border into Texas, and eventually making their way to Georgia. Their aunt was living in a suburb of Atlanta and they moved in with her and her kids. Jose remembers how different it felt from El Salvador. Jose Trejo Lopez:And now going to a country where you see kids playing basketball, playing soccer, or riding a bike in the street. You’re seeing all those beautiful houses, even the grass, the green grass, the landscape, it was so beautiful to me. And I was like, “Dude, I love this.” I really like this type of life. Katie Mingle:School was a different story though, a foreign country in and of itself. The brothers didn’t know what their teachers were saying. Jose said he used Google Translate to try to do his homework. Not speaking English was such an immense barrier that it sometimes felt to Jose like the only barrier. Jose Trejo Lopez:I remember I used to tell myself, hey, when I learn the language, I’m not going to have bad grades, I’m going to have A’s and B’s. Katie Mingle:Their cousins told the boys to download Duolingo. And they did. They also watched TV and movies in English. And slowly they got better at the language and started to fit in. Jose Trejo Lopez:At the end, I was like, “Dude, this is what basically feeling an American is like.” Having friends, graduating from high school, good grades. Katie Mingle:In their early years in the country, an attorney had encouraged the boys and their mother to apply for asylum. In 2018 their claim was denied. And Josue, Jose and their mom, Alma, all received deportation orders. Since coming to the US, Alma had given birth to a third son, Mateo, a US citizen with significant disabilities. Alma didn’t believe Mateo could get the healthcare he needed in El Salvador, so she kept her family in the US and began looking into other pathways to remain here legally. In the meantime, they always went to their check-ins with ICE even when they interfered with other things. Jose Trejo Lopez:I remember one time that we had a check-in during the finals, and I was like, “What can I do about it?” How am I going to deal with these two things going on at the same time? If I miss the final, I’m going to get a zero. If I miss the check-in, I’m going to be in a big deal with ICE. Katie Mingle:What did you do? Jose Trejo Lopez:I went to the check-in, I missed my final. Katie Mingle:Jose graduated from high school in May of 2023 and moved to New York City to live with a family friend. Josue should have graduated in the spring of 2024, but he was behind on credits. He was determined not to have to do a whole extra year of high school though. And his teacher told him he’d need to do a bunch of extra credits on top of his regular load of classes to be able to finish in December. Josue Trejo Lopez:She told me, “Look, you need to do 11 credits.” I was like, “Jeez, 11 credits.” But I tell myself, yeah, if I don’t do this I’m never going to get out of here. I even stop playing video games, I just focus on school. I did three credits in one month. Katie Mingle:Josue told me he worked harder than he’d ever worked. And he did it. He finished all of his high school credits in December of 2024. And he joined his brother in New York. His plan was to return to Georgia to walk in his high school graduation ceremony in May of this year. But that’s not what happened. In March, the boys went to a routine check-in at an ICE field office in Manhattan. Their mom had traveled from Georgia to go with them. When they got there, they were told that the building was full and they’d have to send an email requesting another check-in. And then an ICE officer said something strange to Jose. Jose Trejo Lopez:He told me, “Good luck.” I was like, “Wait.” That’s kind of strange to me because during this whole time that I have to go check-ins never an ICE officer had told me good luck. Katie Mingle:The boys were hoping their next check-in would be in maybe six months or a year. But when they got the email it said they should report back in two days. This is the point where some people might have chosen not to show up, just lay low and hide out. But Jose told me they never considered this, they wanted to follow the rules. When they returned to the ICE office two days later, and were called up to the counter, the officer asked if they knew they had a deportation order. Jose Trejo Lopez:And I was like, “Yes, I know.” And he was like, “Okay, and are you doing something about it?” And I was like, “Yeah, yeah, I have all my papers that my attorney gave me.” It was like this big. It was for especially juvenile status. Katie Mingle:The previous year in 2024, the boys had begun the process of applying for special immigrant juvenile status. If they got it, the status would allow them to remain in the country legally. Theirs was exactly the kind of situation that didn’t used to be a priority for ICE. In previous administrations, even in Trump’s first term, it was generally the case that if you had a deportation order but you could prove you were pursuing some kind of legal remedy, ICE wouldn’t detain you. This was especially true if you didn’t have a criminal record. And Jose and Josue have never been in trouble with the law. But none of this seemed to matter to the ICE officer who was looking at their paperwork. Jose Trejo Lopez:He only looked at the first page. And then he was like, “This is not going to help you, this is worth nothing basically.” And gave it back to me. And he was like, “Okay, give me a minute. I’m going to talk to my supervisor.” Katie Mingle:The boys went to sit down. They were nervous. Eventually, the officer came back and asked Jose and Josue to follow him to another area, away from their mom and little brother who they’d come with. Jose Trejo Lopez:And then he told me, “Okay, you are being detained by ICE and you are going to be put in removing proceeding. If you have anything that you want to give it back to your mom, your phone, your wallet, give it to me right now so I can bring it to her.” I look back and my brother was in handcuff. When they put the handcuffs on me, I was like, “Is this really happening to us?” We had never been put in handcuffs because we had no problems with the law. I couldn’t express the feelings that I was feeling in that moment because I felt like a criminal. Katie Mingle:Just like Jose and Josue, more than half of all people arrested by ICE in New York City in the first five months of the Trump administration had no criminal record according to data gathered by The New York Times. And according to federal data, half of those arrested were detained just like this during routine check-ins and court appearances. Jose Trejo Lopez:They didn’t let us say at least bye to our mom, not to our little brother. Katie Mingle:The boys were taken to a detention facility in Buffalo, New York. Jose Trejo Lopez:And I told the ICE officer, “Hey, can you keep us together at least? Me and my brother together to the same detention facility on the same unit?” He was like, “Yeah, I’m going to try.” But I guess he didn’t try because we were separated as soon as we got to the detention facility. Katie Mingle:After a couple of weeks, their lawyer filed a petition, and they did get to be together. Jose, with the authority vested in his single extra year on this planet, tried to be strong for his younger brother. Jose Trejo Lopez:Basically, I was the pillar, I was the one holding everything at that moment. I told my brother, “Hey, bro, don’t cry or don’t act up, just relax, we’re going to go through this. Either way, if we don’t like it, we’re going to go through it.” Katie Mingle:Jose only cried once he told me, alone in the bathroom where Josue couldn’t see. Josue, for his part, tried to keep the mood light. Josue Trejo Lopez:I was just trying to make this guy laugh. Katie Mingle:On May 7th, both boys were deported back to El Salvador. They hadn’t been there in almost 10 years and they had no close family or friends still in the country. Their mom, Alma, is still in the US. It’s possible she’s been spared from deportation thus far because she’s the sole caretaker for her disabled son, Mateo. I asked Alma if knowing what she knows now she regretted bringing Jose and Josue to the US. She told me she doesn’t. Her sons had so many more opportunities here than they would’ve had in El Salvador. But she told me that she does regret allowing them to go to that final check-in appointment with ICE. A distant family friend, who the boys had never met, picked them up from the immigration office in El Salvador and let them live in his house for their first few months in the country. His name is also Jose, which is maybe why they always call him the old man. Josue Trejo Lopez:Well, he’s an old man, he’s already 69 years old, so he’s older. Katie Mingle:It was from the old man’s apartment near the capital city of San Salvador that Josue watched his high school graduation ceremony on a live stream. Speaker 19:We made it. From freshman jitters to senior celebrations, we have navigated some of the most defining years of our lives. Tonight we celebrate Katie Mingle:Josue had planned to be there with his friends. He already had his cap and gown. Instead, he watched on YouTube as his former classmates’ names were called. And one by one they walked across the stage to get their diplomas. Speaker 20:Robert Torres, honors, going on. Josue Trejo Lopez:Now, we’re just watching to see my friends walking. I thought they’re not going to call my name. Katie Mingle:But then they did call his name. Speaker 20:Josue Trejo Lopezz. Katie Mingle:Older brother, Jose, was in another room and he could hear Josue watching the live stream. Jose Trejo Lopez:I was hearing him watching the ceremony, and then hear they call his name and then he came out. I have a video of it because I was like, “I’m going to record just to have as a memory that this happened to us.” Katie Mingle:Jose holds up the phone selfie-style and films while his brother lays his head on his stomach and sobs. “Did they say your name at the graduation?” Jose asks his brother. Jose Trejo Lopez:[foreign language 00:16:37] Katie Mingle:“The good thing is that you got your diploma,” Jose tells him. Jose Trejo Lopez:[foreign language 00:16:46]. Katie Mingle:“You managed to graduate, that’s good.” Jose Trejo Lopez:[foreign language 00:16:55]. Katie Mingle:At the end of the graduation ceremony, a student speaker emphasizes that it isn’t just the end of one chapter, it’s the beginning of another. “It’s time to embrace the changes ahead,” she tells the crowd, “and walk confidently toward the future.” But when I ask Jose to imagine what a future might look like in El Salvador, he’s at a total loss. Jose Trejo Lopez:I don’t have an answer to that yet, or soon, because it is hard. It is hard to think about. I don’t know if we’re going to start looking for jobs. I don’t know if we’re going to start thinking about a future in here. First because it’s just going to be me and my brother, right? Being separated from our family is actually one of the biggest trauma that we have right now. Because who is going to be supporting us? Who’s going to be directing us in this country when we don’t know how the system works? I really want to go back to my family. I want to go back to the country that I call my home. Katie Mingle:Before they were deported, Jose and Josue both imagined they might attend a trade school of some kind, become mechanics or welders. Help support their mom and their little brother, and eventually have families of their own. Now they’re just hoping some way, somehow they get back to the country where that future still exists. Al Letson:As schools across the country start a new school year, teachers and administrators are bracing for what ICE’s continued expansion could mean for students, including how it might affect attendance. Last spring, some California school districts saw attendance drop by more than 20% because of fear over immigration raids. That story was produced by Katie Mingle. When we come back, we’ll meet a restaurant owner trying to figure out how to keep her business open after her brother is detained by ICE. Speaker 21:It’s becoming almost like it’s not sustainable for me to just keep operating the way I’m operating. I did not include my brother being picked up by ICE in my business plan. Al Letson:You’re listening to Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting in PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Like a lot of restaurants these days, the Nigerian restaurant Suya Joint in Boston has an Instagram account. Scrolling through the last few months of their posts is a mouth-watering experience. Pictures of stir-fried tofu and jollof rice, glistening fried plantains, pineapple upside-down cake. But in late June, there’s a different kind of post. The owner of the restaurant, Cecilia Lizotte, has written a note to her followers that begins, “Dear Suya Joint family, help us bring Paul home.” The note goes on. “Being forced apart like this is tearing through the heart of our home and community.” Cecilia’s brother, Paul, the manager of the restaurant, had been detained by ICE on his way to church. The news over the last few months has been full of stories about restaurant employees being picked up by ICE, and when Mother Jones reporter, Julia Lurie, saw Suya Joint’s news on Instagram, it made her wonder what it’s like for the people left behind, what it’s like to run a restaurant or any business really, when a key employee, who happens to be your brother, suddenly disappears. Julia Lurie:I went to eat at Suya Joint for the first time in May with a reporter friend of mine who’d been raving about it. It was just a few weeks later when I saw the post on Instagram. The owner, Cecilia, would later refer to it as a cry for help, and that’s what it seemed like to me. Her post was basically saying, “I’m not sure if I can handle this.” It made me want to know more, so I headed back to Suya Joint. Cecelia Lizotte:So you see that this is where all of us have a Hi, hi, hi. Yeah. Those are everybody- Julia Lurie:That’s Cecilia greeting a kitchen full of cooks prepping for dinner. Cecelia Lizotte:It sounds so good in here. Speaker 4:Thank you. Thank you so much. Julia Lurie:Cecilia learned to cook from her grandmother, who ran a little restaurant in Central Nigeria. After she came to Boston in 1999, she started catering out of her home, which eventually led to opening Suya Joint as a brick and mortar. Now she has two locations and a food truck, and last year Cecilia was a semi-finalist for the prestigious James Beard Award. Cecelia Lizotte:Maybe inside, just it’s a little tighter. Speaker 4:Okay. Julia Lurie:We duck into a storage room away from the commotion to talk about Paul. Cecelia Lizotte:Don’t mind the mess. Julia Lurie:No problem. Cecilia and her brother balance each other out. Cecilia is the outgoing one. Loud, chatty, wears chunky jewelry in bold colors. Paul meanwhile is quiet, attentive, the go-to guy for critical behind-the-scenes jobs. It’s Paul who picks up ingredients from New York, who comes in to fix the plumbing in a pinch, or waits tables when Cecilia is short-staffed. Cecelia Lizotte:When I see him coming through the door, it’s like, I feel really, really safe. It’s like, “Yes, you are here.” Julia Lurie:Paul was on his way to church on Father’s Day when he was picked up by ICE. When I asked ICE about Paul’s case, a representative said that he’d been, quote, “Unlawfully residing in the United States since August 2019 when he violated the terms of his lawful admission.” Records show that Paul came to the US on a visitor visa in 2019 and applied for asylum later that year. When he was arrested, his case was ongoing. He had a social security number and a work authorization that’s valid until 2029. Under previous administrations, people like Paul wouldn’t have been a high priority for ICE, but things are different now. When he was arrested, Paul asked the officers if he could make a phone call to his sister. Cecelia Lizotte:I felt like someone just sucked my blood, my air, anything like, “How do you live?” Julia Lurie:Yeah. There’s not a playbook for someone in your situation. Cecelia Lizotte:No, there’s absolutely not a playbook. You wake up one day, you feel energized, and then within a twinkle of an eye, it’s almost like, “Where do I throw up?” It’s that bad. It’s terrible. Julia Lurie:There’s an eerie familiarity to Paul’s detention. The year before he came to the States, he was kidnapped by Boko Haram. The militant group was targeting journalists, and at the time Paul was working as a crime reporter for the Nigerian Television Authority. Paul talked about the kidnapping in a BBC documentary back in 2019. Paul Dama:I was scared. I was really, really scared because I started to imagine the trauma my family members were going to go through. Julia Lurie:Paul and Cecilia’s mom got the call from Boko Haram telling her he’d been kidnapped. Cecilia says her mom was literally speechless, kept fainting because of the news. The family scrambled to come up with the nearly $13,000 to free him. According to Paul’s asylum application, they even sold most of their property to make it happen. After four hellish days, Paul was released. Nigerian police told him they couldn’t guarantee a safety, advised him to leave the country. In his asylum application, Paul wrote, “This is why I’m here in the United States where I can feel safe and have my freedom guaranteed.” Cecelia Lizotte:And now in Boston, in America, literally right now as we speak, I just feel like, “Here’s another second kidnapping, he’s been picked up, and here we are at the mercy of everybody.” Julia Lurie:When I met with Cecilia, Paul had been sitting in a detention center in Dover, New Hampshire for two weeks. She seemed to be running on adrenaline moving 1,000 miles a minute. I had the sense that talking to a reporter was just one more item on her mile-long to-do list, which in a way, it was. She had to collect character statements for Paul’s upcoming hearing. She had to be there for her daughters, for her staff, for her relatives in Nigeria who were distraught about what was happening. And then there was Paul’s lawyer who could call at any moment looking for documents. Cecelia Lizotte:Before they can finish asking the question, I already know kind of the answer and I know exactly where to find it. And then, “Here you go, here you go.” Julia Lurie:Right now, Cecilia’s top priority is getting ready for the bond hearing, when a judge will decide if Paul can be released from detention while his asylum case is ongoing. Cecilia knows he faces an uphill battle. Last year, Paul was charged with two misdemeanors for operating a vehicle under the influence. Both times he was found sleeping in his stopped car, keys in the ignition according to police reports. Cecilia says he was in a dark place at the time, grieving the sudden loss of their mother and pulled over to sleep. In both cases, a judge sentenced Paul to a year-long probation. He also had to pay a fine and complete a program for impaired drivers. Typically, if you complete the terms of the sentence, in a case like this, the charges can be dismissed. Cecelia Lizotte:We all have our own dark, whatever moments that we’re living with. This guy came out and he’s like, “Okay, you know what? This is not it.” And he’s been like in therapy. He has done so much extensive things to make sure that he’s doing the right things. Julia Lurie:When I left the restaurant, Cecilia seemed overwhelmed but also focused. She had a mission, which was getting ready for the bond hearing. We agreed we’d check in after it was over. On the day of the hearing, I called Cecilia, no answer, no response to text either. A few days later I call again and she picks up sounding exhausted. Paul’s bond was denied. Paul’s lawyer told Cecilia that the DUIs had come up in the hearing and the judge wasn’t convinced Paul should be released. So are you doing with this news? Cecelia Lizotte:Thank you. It’s crazy. Julia Lurie:How is it for you to be working? I’m imagining it would be kind of hard to be positive and stuff like that around customers. Cecelia Lizotte:No, no. This is very, very difficult. And I think when I met with you all, I was hopeful I was doing okay, but then as time goes on, I’m just getting more and more defeated, just very, very much getting sick mentally, emotionally. It’s becoming almost like it’s not sustainable for me to just keep operating the way I’m operating. I don’t think anybody say like, “Okay, when I’m writing a business plan included this,” so I did not include my brother being picked up by ICE in my whole entire business plan. I’m not able to operate the establishment basically because it’s crazy. Julia Lurie:Cecilia told me she’s having trouble sleeping. She’s crying a lot, and this sounds like a bad metaphor, but it’s actually quite literal. Cecilia, the award-winning chef, has lost her appetite. Cecelia Lizotte:It’s just little nibbles like cat, and I’m like, “No, this is not good.” Julia Lurie:One of the many things weighing on Cecilia are all of the expenses. There are the legal retainers, $2,500 for the bond hearing, $13,000 for the asylum hearing, and then there’s all the cost of living that Paul normally would’ve paid for himself. Cecelia Lizotte:We are now left with paying all his rent, insurance, car payment, phone bills. It adds up. It piles up. Julia Lurie:This may sound naive, but I never really thought about all the recurring normal life expenses that pile up when a person suddenly disappears. It’s not like when someone dies and there’s no question, you cancel their rent and their phone bill. This is different. Cecilia has to decide, does she keep paying his $1,300 rent in hopes that he comes back, or does she go clean out his apartment? And Paul, of course, hates that she’s been put in this position. Cecelia Lizotte:He was very, very devastated, upset with the fact that all these things that now is put on the family is something that he is strong, capable of doing what he’s been doing all this time. So he’s very much distraught. Julia Lurie:Ever since news broke of Paul’s arrest, donations have poured in. Within two weeks, a GoFundMe for Paul’s legal expenses raised $32,000. Sometimes customers leave little notes of support in the delivery instructions of takeout orders. Cecilia shared one with me that said to leave the order in the lobby, and then went on, quote, “I’m so disgusted to hear about Paul Dama. I’ll do anything to help. Thank you for being my comfort food for the last five years.” Cecelia Lizotte:We’ve been receiving a lot of support from customers that we’ve never seen before based on what they’ve heard maybe on the news or they’ve read on the newspaper just to make sure that the establishment is sustained and it’s going. But me, the owner, is breaking. Julia Lurie:In moments when she’s feeling down, Cecilia seriously considers abandoning the life she’s built here, closing down the restaurant, going back to Nigeria even though she’s a US citizen. Her daughters and employees hate when she talks like this. They’re holding onto her and they want her to stay strong for them. But Cecilia’s like, “I’m trying to stay strong, but without Paul, who am I holding onto?” Cecilia talks to Paul almost every day. During one of their recent calls, a friend Paul made in detention got on the phone. Cecelia Lizotte:Then he explained to me how Paul is almost like they call him the president. They’re like, “You are our president.” Any question they have go to Paul, anywhere for them to feel some sense of a comfort, “Go to Paul, go to Paul.” I was joking with Paul like, “You can’t leave because you have a lot of almost like followers that are looking up to you to make this whole entire thing make sense.” Julia Lurie:Cecilia, of course, knows exactly how they feel. Al Letson:That was from Mother Jones reporter, Julia Lurie. You can’t talk about the federal government’s deportation efforts without talking about Los Angeles. Trump famously activated the National Guard on LA streets, and ICE has been targeting the city for months. But a tiny LA newsroom that used to be focused mostly on tacos has been tracking ICE and fighting back. Speaker 5:I’ve been going through hundreds of DMs, where they’re being spotted, so be careful, mi raza, keep your bootstraps tight. Al Letson:That’s next on Reveal. Stay with us. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today we’re telling stories of people rounded up as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. Our last story takes us to Los Angeles, where since June, thousands of people have been swept up in aggressive raids. ICE and Border Patrol are raiding car washes, Home Depots, outdoor markets, places where undocumented immigrants work and hang out. Federal agents have no arrest warrants and they’re picking up random individuals. Then in July News Anchor:A federal judge just ruling ICE and the Border Patrol must stop their aggressive tactics immediately, saying, “There is a mountain of evidence the feds are in fact breaking the law.” Al Letson:The judge said federal agents may not go after people based on their race or ethnicity or because they speak Spanish or work in a particular industry. That same day, Border Czar Tom Homan came on Fox News and acknowledged that that is basically what the government is doing. Tom Homan:They just got through their observation, get articulable facts based on their location, the occupation, their physical appearance, their actions. Al Letson:For Homan, it’s how agents establish reasonable suspicion. For the judge, it’s profiling. The Trump administration appealed the judge’s order and lost, and now they’ve appealed up to the Supreme Court. The Department of Homeland Security continues to claim that the raids do not target Latinos and are based on investigations. Officials say they’re going after criminals, but according to an analysis of government data, agents arrested just over 4,300 people in June and July in Los Angeles. About 86% were Latino, and less than a third of the people arrested had a criminal conviction. People are scared and angry and they’re turning to a tiny newsroom called L.A. Taco for information about where ICE raids are happening. As you might’ve guessed from the name, L.A. Taco writes about food, but since June, it’s been using its deep roots in Los Angeles to set the record straight and expose what ICE is doing in the communities it covers. Reveal’s Steven Rascón spent time with L.A. Taco to learn how it ended up in the trenches of one of the biggest civil rights moments in the country’s recent history. Steven takes it from here. Audio:Salsa. Salsa? It’ll be 50 cents. Steven Rascón:A cook pulls a fish filet out of the fryer, lays it over some tortillas, and tops it off with some diced tomato, then hands it to a customer. Audio:[Spanish 00:02:45] Steven Rascón:It’s lunchtime at Tacos Baja in East Los Angeles. Memo Torres:The go-to order here is the Baja-Style Fish Taco. I’m going to get that. Steven Rascón:Memo Torres knows his tacos well and so does his colleague, Javier. Javier Cabral:My name’s Javier Cabral. I’m the editor-in-chief of L.A. Taco. Steven Rascón:Javier and Memo have been reviewing places like this for years. They even won a James Beard Award for their food coverage. Javier Cabral:I actually grew up coming here with my parents on Wednesdays because they’re super cheap tacos. They used to be a dollar. I think right now, they’re $1.59 now, so taco inflation. That’s not bad. Memo Torres:That’s bad at all. Javier Cabral:That’s not bad. They’re not letting people inside right now, which I think is interesting. Steven Rascón:Tacos Baja is serving tacos but behind locked doors. Javier Cabral:They also have the sign, check it out. Memo Torres:“[Spanish 00:03:29] ICE.” Steven Rascón:“Everyone is welcome here, except ICE, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” Javier Cabral:And it says, “Private property. No trespassing. Federal agents prohibited without a judicial warrant,” with “ICE” crossed out. Steven Rascón:The signs are up because this past June, ICE agents raided a local food truck called Jason’s Tacos. Jason, the owner, posted this video to Instagram after the raid. You can see the truck is empty, carne asada left sizzling on the grill. Jason Devora:Wow. There’s no joke, guys. They took all my employees, all of them. It’s crazy. Within like two minutes. Steven Rascón:Jason’s Tacos is just one of hundreds of taqueros that L.A. Taco has written about over the years. ICE was now targeting them. Javier and Memo know these people. It was personal. Memo Torres:Where our taqueros, our beloved taqueros are closing now because Steven Rascón:Memo made a video about it for L.A. Taco’s Instagram. Memo Torres:Folks are scared and rightly so. After, especially after seeing Jason’s Tacos, two taqueros get abducted, and four of his clients? That’s wild. Steven Rascón:If there ever was such a thing as a perfect crisis for L.A. Taco to be ready for, this was it. Years of reporting on local businesses had created trust and a big online following, and that trust was starting to pay off because people were now sending Memo tips about what ICE was doing. Memo Torres:I’ve been going through hundreds of DMs, where they’re being spotted, and it’s a pretty general theme. The theme is working Latinos, so be careful, mi raza. Keep your bootstraps tight. Steven Rascón:Memo was swamped with information, so the team decided that the raids should take priority over their taco coverage, and soon L.A. Taco’s Instagram became a daily journal for ICE activity across Los Angeles. Memo Torres:It’s June 20th and this is your Daily Memo as to what’s been going on in LA today, and boy, has it been busy. ICE has been everywhere. All right, so It’s Tuesday, June 24th. It’s Wednesday, June 25th and these are your ICE recaps for L.A. June 27th, the 22nd straight day of the ICE siege here in Los Angeles. They were at the Home Depot and a car wash in Huntington Park downtown on 6th and Grand, taking people, went back to the Walmart in Pico Rivera Steven Rascón:As Memo speaks, videos run behind him showing men in masks, carrying rifles, wearing tactical gear, dressed like they’re going to war. ICE is everywhere and people feel targeted. Video:This is the property of the church! This is Downey Memorial Christian Church and we are not okay with you being on our property. We are not okay Steven Rascón:Before resharing a video like this one, the first thing Memo does is find the person who shot it. Memo Torres:Either I or somebody on the team will reach out to them directly and be like, “Hey, hey, so we heard that they were at your taqueria. We heard that they were at the school.” Steven Rascón:He needs to make sure the video is accurate, and Memo gets a lot of videos. Memo Torres:Sometimes I have 43 different videos and pictures that I’m like, “Okay, how am I going to fit all this into a three-minute video?” Steven Rascón:For him, carefully documenting what’s happening in communities is a way to fight against the Trump administration’s false narrative. Memo Torres:They want to portray this picture as ICE being heroes and Border Patrol being heroes and out here being brave men, yet in the same light, it’s like we have to show what are they actually doing? Old men are getting tackled at bus stops. They shot at a kid in a truck. They brutalized this TikToker who was recording them. You got to show the brutality, the criminalization of just people that are working, street vendors, people that are day laborers, people that are at their jobs gardening. Steven Rascón:We reached out to the Department of Homeland Security to ask why so many Latinos without criminal records were being targeted. We shared the numbers with them. A senior DHS official wrote back and did not dispute the data, and instead continued to claim without proof that, quote, “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, and rapists.” We also asked about several incidents that were violent, and the official said, “In each case, the agent’s actions were justified.” Throughout the summer, Memo keeps documenting and he’s noticing U.S. citizens are getting swept up in the raids. Javier Ramirez:They said that they came looking for immigrants and the only person that they got was a U.S. citizen. Steven Rascón:This man, Javier Ramirez, was working at a tow yard when Border Patrol agents arrested and detained him at a federal detention center, and there was Joe Garcia. Memo Torres:The U.S. citizen that was arrested at the Home Depot in Hollywood and then transferred Steven Rascón:And then transferred to the same federal detention center after he filmed a raid and told a group of men not to respond to ICE agents. Around the same time, Border Patrol arrests another U.S. citizen after he tries to protest a man being detained. He spent three days in federal detention. A reporter named Aisha Wallace-Palomares discovered the story. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:I was like, “Oh my God, this is huge, a U.S. citizen detained by federal immigration agents.” Steven Rascón:At the time, Aisha was a freelance reporter covering the ICE protests outside the Federal Building. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:Outside of the Federal Building in Downtown, L.A. Steven Rascón:It’s where ICE processes the people it plans to deport. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:Because tear gas has been deployed here over the past few days and there’s still remnants of those. Steven Rascón:One day, she notices a family standing outside of the detention center. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:They didn’t look like protesters. They looked out of place. And I was like, “Hey, you know, what’s going on?” Being a nosy reporter. And they were like, “Our son was taken today.” And I said, “Your son was taken today? Taken by who?” And they said that he was taken by ICE and that he was a U.S. citizen. Steven Rascón:Aisha sticks around. She talks to the dad. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:And he said, “Yes, and I have a video of it,” and I had actually recognized the video because it had come up on my feed earlier that morning. It had gone viral already by that point because of the brutality. Steven Rascón:The video shows a thin 20-something-year-old, Adrian Martinez, wearing a blue Walmart vest yelling at the agents for detaining a janitor. He cleans the plaza where Adrian works. The agents tackle Adrian, grab him by the neck, throw him into a Border Patrol vehicle and take him away along with the janitor. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:And so at that point, I decided I needed to step away from them for at least a few minutes because I needed to send an Instagram DM to L.A. Taco and I was just crossing my fingers hoping that they would see it and be interested in the story. Steven Rascón:L.A. Taco DMs back, and by that night, Adrian’s story is on the Daily Memo. Memo Torres:Adrian, according to his family, is a U.S. citizen, but this is just hard to watch, guys. I mean, he’s a 20-year-old. Aisha Wallace-Palomares:I think within an hour or two, it was already at like 600,000 views. Steven Rascón:The video creates outrage online. Major news outlets are picking up the story, NBC, CNN, L.A. Times. And a few days later, Border Patrol Assistant Chief David Kim comes out with a different story on Fox News. David Kim:The narrative right now is just a U.S. citizen was arrested for no reason, but that subject punched two agents. Steven Rascón:We asked Border Patrol whether they had any proof of this because the videos Aisha and Memo looked at show that Adrian definitely confronts ICE agents, but he never throws a punch. They didn’t get back to us. Oscar Preciado:My name is Oscar Preciado. Steven Rascón:Oscar was there that day and also didn’t see Adrian throw a punch. He recorded the original video that went viral. Oscar Preciado:I do photography for music events and then I also do Instacart on the side. Born and raised here in East L.A. So that day, I was working Instacart at the Pico Rivera Walmart, and that’s where we saw them pull up to a janitor that was out there cleaning, doing his job, and that’s where everything just got pretty crazy. Video:Hey! Hey! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Steven Rascón:Oscar’s video shows Border Patrol agents driving into a parking lot. People are honking their horns at them. Two men run when they see them. One of them is the janitor. Video:Get out of the way. I don’t know him. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Oscar Preciado:When I turn back around recording, that’s where Adrian shows up. Steven Rascón:Adrian pulls up in a black sedan. He approaches a Border Patrol agent. Video:What the fuck? What is he doing? He’s a fucking hard worker! [inaudible 00:12:34] Video:Hey, we’re taking that as motherfucking evidence! I’m giving that to- Car, put him in the car! Steven Rascón:It’s clear from the video that Adrian isn’t the only one upset. People try to block in the agents with their cars. Oscar is trying to capture as much as he can on his phone. Video:I’m not doing shit! Hey, what the fuck, dude? You can’t be doing that shit! Adrian Martinez:The guy smacked the phone out of my hand. I picked it back up, kept recording. Video:It’s my civil right! I can fucking record you if I want! Steven Rascón:Oscar keeps recording through a cracked screen. He captures three agents restraining Adrian. Video:Why are you guys putting hands on homie? Look at all these little bitches. [inaudible 00:13:31] He’s a U.S. citizen! Right here. Steven Rascón:Oscar and Adrian didn’t know each other, but when they saw the janitor get taken away, it felt like an injustice to both of them. Adrian Martinez:I feel like that’s kidnapping. You can’t just go to their job and like, “Oh, I’m taking you.” It’s not right, so. Oscar Preciado:You’re upset about what’s going on and what they’ve been doing to the communities and anybody that’s of color, any brown person they see. Steven Rascón:Since June, ICE has detained at least seven U.S. citizens. Some were let go and charges were dropped, but Adrian was indicted. Federal prosecutors are charging him with conspiracy to impede a federal officer. Pedro Chavez:I sympathize with Adrian. Steven Rascón:Pedro Chavez is an immigration lawyer. He runs an organization called Fear of Return, and he’s become a bit of a TikTok sensation for his legal advice, and he’s been following Adrian’s arrest. Pedro Chavez:He looked at this man that is being abducted by ICE and he probably saw his uncle or he saw his dad in that man. It’s like I can feel his emotion. Steven Rascón:Pedro says Adrian’s conspiracy charge is something the government has been using on people who stand up to ICE. He says federal prosecutors would have to prove that what happened at the Walmart wasn’t spontaneous but planned, and that’s a stretch. Pedro Chavez:Because it’s clear that they didn’t meet beforehand. Steven Rascón:Instead, he says they reacted in the moment and were outraged at what they saw, ICE driving around looking for someone to pick up. Pedro Chavez:They didn’t have arrest warrants, they didn’t have search warrants, they had nothing. It was a roving patrol and they admitted it in the complaint. Steven Rascón:Roving patrols are what a federal judge ordered the government to stop doing because they lead to racial profiling. Memo is still getting videos showing they’re happening. Memo Torres:This law enforcement is not obeying laws. They’re not obeying the restraining orders, and then these people are masked. They don’t want to identify themselves. They’re roaming around doing whatever they want. Steven Rascón:He says this is what’s driving the anger across L.A. Memo Torres:How can you not be angered at the cruelty of it, the barbarianism of it? Steven Rascón:And L.A. Taco is committed to covering this story for the long haul. Memo Torres:L.A.’s currently very traumatized. I’ll tell you that right now. People are traumatized. These people, these immigrants, they’re not criminals. They’re our neighbors. Al Letson:After the ICE raids started back in June, tens of thousands of Angelenos took to the streets to express their anger. Trump deployed Marines and the National Guard to tamp down protests and even used soldiers during raids. This month, a judge ruled that it was illegal and said the president violated a federal law that bans the military from being used to do domestic policing. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the judge’s decision.

The first week of school in parts of Long Island has been marked by concern and confusion after reports surfaced of masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appearing near school grounds as students arrived for class.

Community advocacy group Islip Forward shared photos that allegedly show masked ICE officers positioned just outside Brentwood High School early Wednesday morning, coinciding with the school’s opening day. A similar scene was reportedly observed outside Alverta B. Schultz Middle School in Hempstead on Thursday.

Parents and community members are expressing alarm at what they say is a troubling presence near institutions meant to be safe havens for children.

“The kids are supposed to have peace, not be in fear,” said Marta, a Brentwood grandmother. “It’s terrible. The kids haven’t done anything wrong — they’re not criminals. I don’t understand why [ICE] has to come near the school.”

The Brentwood School District responded by issuing a message to families, assuring them that ICE agents did not enter school property. However, the proximity of immigration enforcement activity to the school has nonetheless left many residents shaken.

School officials in Hempstead said the officers did not enter school grounds, and said there has been no substantive given to the district that there were actual ICE agents at the school.",https://images-cf.news12static.com/3kqcuzntcg31/2SDKkVaMGQbnszsKWCJqfk/135c62e28c6fafa21205285c70b97e40/d7bb79a3-2c42-40fe-a777-2f193ca86aa3.jpg?fit=thumb&w=600&h=340&q=80&fm=webp,N,,2025-09-06 06:56:18.932026

Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.
“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.
Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.
“So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job.","Federal immigration authorities say they arrested dozens of South Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, marking what the Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest-ever raid — and triggering outrage from South Korean officials who expressed “concern and regret” over the operation.

But a search warrant seen by The Independent shows that agents were seeking the arrests of only four workers at the facility — who are Latino.

Agents arrested 475 people on Thursday at a battery facility on the sprawling Hyundai campus in Ellabell, Georgia — roughly 30 miles west of Savannah — as part of an “ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” according to Homeland Security.

A judge approved the warrant following a months-long investigation, according to Steve Schrank, a special agent in charge of Homeland Securities Investigations Atlanta. Schrank hailed the arrests as “the largest single-site enforcement operation” in the history of the agency.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said during a press conference Friday.

No criminal charges were announced, but Schrank said many of the factory’s workers were living and working in the United States without legal permission.

The massive operation targeted a sprawling, 3,000-acre complex in a state under Republican leadership, which has hailed the $7.6 billion Hyundai Motor Group investment as one of the state’s largest economic development projects in its history.

South Korea's biggest automaker began manufacturing electric vehicles at the plant last year, which employs more than 1,000 people. LG Energy Solution operates an adjacent battery plant set to open next year.

But Donald Trump’s administration did not appear to give its key ally any advance notice of the operation, which caught Seoul by surprise.

The country’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong expressed “concerns and regret” following news of the arrests and urged “special attention to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our citizens are not violated.""

“The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,” the ministry said following news of the arrests.

Just last week, Trump hosted South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House to announce a $150 billion investment in the United States, including battery manufacturing.

Responding to questions at the White House about whether his anti-immigration agenda is clashing with his efforts to pull billions of dollars of foreign investment into the economy, Trump said “they were illegal aliens” and Immigration and Customs Enforcement “was just doing its job.”

He wants to “get along with other countries, and we want to have a great, stable workforce,” he said in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday.

“And we had, as I understand it, a lot of illegal aliens, some not the best of people, but we had a lot of illegal aliens working there,” he said. “So, you know, look, [federal agents] are doing their job. That’s what they have to do.”

In a statement, Hyundai said the company is “closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.”

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company said.

With a directive from the White House to make thousands of daily arrests, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has received record-breaking funding from Congress — expanding the agency’s budget to be larger than most countries’ militaries — to hire more officers and expand detention space.

The Trump administration has deployed federal agents across the country to support his aggressive mass deportation agenda with large-scale arrests and sweeps targeting major Democratic-led cities with large immigrant populations. A record 60,000 people are currently locked up in immigration detention centers across the country.

The administration has directed all federal law enforcement agencies to converge around immigration enforcement, drawing warnings from immigration attorneys and advocates that those arrest quotas will almost certainly include “collateral” arrests of citizens and others with lawful immigration status.

The country’s labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants within the first seven months of the year, including people who are in the country without legal permission, according to an analysis of preliminary Census Bureau data from the Pew Research Center.

That massive reduction has affected industries with large populations of foreign-born workers, including farming, construction and home healthcare.

Roughly 92 percent of construction companies reported project delays due to workforce shortages, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/05/20/17/G0CV4fnWUAAsFWC.jpeg?trim=0,86,0,8&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-09-06 06:56:25.190942

Agents on Thursday arrested 475 people, most of whom are South Korean citizens, at a construction site for an electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Ga., near Savannah, Steven Schrank, a special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, said at a news conference.

The raid was the culmination of an investigation that took place over several months, he said.

Mr. Schrank said that the workers arrested were in the United States illegally or were working unlawfully. No criminal charges would be announced on Friday, he said, adding that investigators were still determining employment details for those arrested, some of whom worked for subcontractors.

The operation aimed to ensure “a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law,” Mr. Schrank said.

Most of those arrested were held at the Folkston detention facility in Georgia on Thursday night.

The battery manufacturer, LG Energy Solution, which co-owns the plant with Hyundai Motor Group, said in a statement that its employees and those from its partnering companies had been taken into custody.

Hyundai said in a statement that none of those detained were Hyundai employees, as far as the company was aware.

“We are closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances,” Hyundai said on Friday.

It added that it was reviewing its processes “to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves,” including “thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors.”

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry confirmed on Friday that South Koreans were among those in custody, without saying how many.

Mr. Schrank told reporters at the plant on Thursday that some U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents had been detained initially and were being released.

Charles Kuck, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta, said two of his clients who were in the country under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa were caught up in the raid.

“My clients were doing exactly what they were allowed to do under the visa waiver — attend business meetings,” he said on Friday, noting that one of them “had just arrived on Tuesday and was leaving next week.”

James Woo, communications director for the Atlanta office of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said he had been on the phone all day with South Korean residents across Georgia.

“People are in shock,” Mr. Woo said, adding that there was deep concern about how those arrested were being treated by ICE officials. He noted that the Korean community in Savannah was small and “has never become one” with the plant and its workers.

“There aren’t the same resources you’d find in Atlanta,” he said. “People don’t know where to go, or how to find legal representation.”

The operation, part of President Trump’s crackdown on immigration, caused diplomatic alarm in South Korea.

Just over a week earlier, Mr. Trump hosted President Lee Jae Myung of South Korea at the White House, where the South Korean leader pledged to invest an additional $150 billion in the United States, including in battery manufacturing.

When asked on Friday whether he was concerned about his immigration agenda clashing with economic goals, Mr. Trump said that ICE was just doing its job.

“They came through illegally. They came into our country. So we have to do our job,” he told a reporter.

The operation on Thursday operation echoed other workplace raids, including a huge one conducted across various work sites in Mississippi during Mr. Trump’s first term. In 2019, federal agents raided several companies in what officials said at the time might have been the largest work-site enforcement action ever in a single state.

More than 600 immigrants who were believed to be working without legal documentation were apprehended during that operation. The Biden administration announced it was ceasing the practice of enforcement operations at businesses in 2021.

In another large workplace raid under the administration of President George W. Bush, 389 workers were arrested at a kosher meatpacking company in Postville, Iowa, in May 2008. The company filed for bankruptcy later that year.

The lithium-ion battery plant, which predated Mr. Lee’s pledge, was expected to start operating next year. It is the kind of large-scale, job-creating investment that the United States has sought from South Korea and other nations.

South Korean companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in American manufacturing in recent years, much of it incentivized by federal subsidies and tax breaks for semiconductor plants and electric vehicle factories.

The Trump administration has already backtracked on some of those commitments, possibly damaging anticipated returns for giants like SK Group, LG and Samsung.

In late July, the White House struck a deal with South Korea that would set 15 percent tariffs on most of the country’s exports to the United States.

South Korean executives told local media that they need their own technicians on-site, at least temporarily, to get all of their factories up and running. And at the same time, South Korean companies are paying billions of dollars in tariffs, diminishing the capital available to spend on new plants.

The Ellabell site is part of one of Georgia’s largest manufacturing plants. Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican, has promoted the $7.6 billion Hyundai E.V. factory there as the largest economic development project in state history.

The immigration operation brought construction to a halt at the battery plant, known as HL-GA Battery Company. A spokeswoman, Mary Beth Kennedy, said in a statement that the plant was cooperating with the authorities.

Jongwon Lee, a Korean lawyer who works in metro Atlanta, said on Friday that South Korean conglomerates are bringing huge investments into the United States, but there aren’t enough visas to sponsor trained workers to run these factories.

The blame lies with the American visa system, he said. The United States “invited us to invest in the U.S., but they don’t give Koreans proper visas.”

The Durham City Council passed the resolution on Tuesday with a unanimous vote to shield city workers against raids and arrests carried out by federal officials, according to The Duke Chronicle.

The Fourth Amendment protects citizens against unreasonable searches and arrests, and requires warrants with probable cause of a crime before seizing a person or property.

The resolution instructs city staff to ""uphold the 4th amendment at their workplace and city agencies and report back to Council any barriers to effective training on the 4th Amendment for any departments,"" The Chronicle reported.

The city has ""historically pursued equity and safety for all residents,"" the resolution stated, adding that having the trust of residents is essential to carrying out its operations.

The measure emphasizes that the threat of ""unconstitutional seizure"" has prevented migrants in the city from ""safely engaging in public life, including pursuing employment and education.""

The resolution comes after four ICE agents in plain clothes showed up without warning at the Durham County Courthouse in July to detain an illegal immigrant facing a felony charge for domestic violence, although the man did not make it to his scheduled court appearance and no arrests were made, WRAL reported.

""Our residents witnessed ICE agents in our community, instilling widespread fear and uncertainty,"" Mayor Leo Williams said in a statement after the incident. ""While local leaders cannot legally override the federal government’s use and weaponization of ICE, we can and must stand in strategic solidarity with our neighbors.""

Residents also organized a demonstration on the day of the incident to protest ICE raids and arrests.

""This is a direct threat to the safety and dignity of our communities. The Courthouse should be a place where people can seek justice, not where they’re hunted down by federal agents,"" Durham County Board of Commissioners Chair Nida Allam, who was part of the demonstration, said at the time.

At the council meeting for the resolution, several migrants and their families spoke in favor of its passage, expressing their anxieties in day-to-day life, according to The Chronicle. Other residents also pushed for added protections for illegal immigrants and training for city staff to enforce the new measure.

""Durham celebrates a rich diversity of residents, and we understand that the Trump administration’s mass deportation targets a completely manufactured panic surrounding immigrants, puts anyone who does not appear White, anyone who does not speak English or has an accent, anyone regardless of papers or immigration status, at risk of abuse, abduction and even deportation to [a] country they have no ties to,"" Elise Ballan, chair of the Durham Workers’ Rights Commission, said at the meeting.

In February, ICE arrested 11 people in Durham who were in the U.S. illegally, according to federal officials. Some Durham residents reported being concerned about the safety of their family members after the arrests.

The federal government accused Durham in April of being a so-called ""sanctuary"" community for allegedly failing to cooperate with immigration officials.

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday released immigration court documents that outline its arguments against Abrego Garcia applying for asylum or receiving it.

A primary argument is that Abrego Garcia is a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization, MS-13, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he hasn't been charged.

Abrego Garcia, 30, became a flashpoint over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native country of El Salvador in March. The U.S. returned him in June, but only to face federal human smuggling in Tennessee, which his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive. He has pleaded not guilty.

Abrego Garcia filed a motion in Baltimore immigration court last month to reopen his 2019 immigration case and apply for asylum again. He was denied the first time because his request came more than a year after he arrived in the U.S.

Abrego Garcia had fled threats of gang violence in his native El Salvador around 2011 to join his brother in Maryland. And while his first asylum request was denied, he was granted protection from deportation to El Salvador because he had established a well-founded fear of gang violence there.

Abrego Garcia was released in 2019 under federal supervision and continued to live with his American wife and children. He checked in with ICE each year, received a federal work permit and was working as a sheet metal apprentice earlier this year, his lawyers have said.

Immigration experts have said that Abrego Garcia’s new asylum application could lead to a green card and a path to citizenship. But by reopening his 2019 case, he also risks being sent back to El Salvador.

The Trump administration stated in court documents this week that it would pursue returning him to his native country if he successfully reopens his previous immigration case.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s lawyers are playing with fire,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Friday. It added: “As a member of a designated foreign terrorist organization, MS-13, he is no longer eligible for his previous immigration relief.”

Abrego Garcia and his attorneys have repeatedly denied the MS-13 allegation. It stems from a day in 2019 when he was detained by local police in Prince George’s County, Maryland.

Abrego Garcia had arrived outside a Home Depot in search of work as a day laborer, according to court documents. Authorities had been told by a confidential informant that Abrego Garcia and other men outside the store could be identified as members of MS-13 because of their clothing and tattoos.

Abrego Garcia was never charged. He was turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and subsequently applied for asylum and ultimately received protection from being deported to El Salvador.

In February, the Trump administration designated MS-13 to be a foreign terrorist organization and wrongfully deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison, where he claims he was beaten and psychologically tortured. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lead immigration attorney, said in a statement Friday that Abrego Garcia would likely get asylum if he gets a fair trial.

“The only reason he was denied asylum in 2019 was because he did not file within one year of entering the United States, a problem which the government has now solved,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “If Mr. Abrego Garcia is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there’s no way he’s not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.”

This is the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project.

The detainment of South Korean nationals also sets it apart, as they are rarely caught up in immigration enforcement compared to other nationalities.

Here are some things to know about the raid and the people impacted:

The workers detained

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.

Some of them worked for the battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution that is slated to open next year, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site, according to Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations.

He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

But an immigration attorney representing two of the detained workers said his clients arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.

Attorney Charles Kuck said one of his clients has been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks, while the other has been in the country for about 45 days, adding that they had been planning to return home soon.

Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday that none of its employees had been detained as far as it knew and that it is reviewing its practices to make sure suppliers and subcontractors follow U.S. employment laws. LG told The Associated Press that it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens and is sending diplomats to the site.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None of them have been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said, but the investigation is ongoing.

Raid is the result of a monthslong investigation

The raid was the result of a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site, Schrank said.

In a search warrant and related affidavits, agents sought everything from employment records for current and former workers and timecards to video and photos of workers.

Court records filed this week indicated that prosecutors do not know who hired what it called “hundreds of illegal aliens.” The identity of the “actual company or contractor hiring the illegal aliens is currently unknown,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote in a Thursday court filing.

The sprawling manufacturing site

The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.

Hyundai Motor Group started manufacturing EVs at the $7.6 billion plant a year ago. Today, the site employs about 1,200 people in a largely rural area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Savannah.

Agents specifically honed in on an adjacent plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county’s Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.

Raid was the ‘largest single site enforcement operation’

From farms and construction sites to restaurants and auto repair shops, there have been a wide array of workplace raids undertaken in this administration. But most have been smaller, including a raid the same day as the Georgia one in which federal officers took away dozens of workers from a snack-bar manufacturer in Cato, New York.

Other recent high-profile raids have included one in July targeting a legal marijuana farm northwest of Los Angeles. More than 360 people were arrested in one of the largest raids since Trump took office in January. Another one took place at an Omaha. Nebraska, meat production plant and involved dozens of workers being taken away.

Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The majority of the people detained are Koreans. During the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2024, only 46 Koreans were deported during out of more than 270,000 removals for all nationalities, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Community members and advocates have mixed reactions

Kemp and other Georgia Republican officials, who had courted Hyundai and celebrated the EV plant’s opening, issued statements Friday saying all employers in the state were expected to follow the law.

The nonprofit legal advocacy organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta described the raid in a joint statement as “unacceptable.”

“Our communities know the workers targeted at Hyundai are everyday people who are trying to feed their families, build stronger communities, and work toward a better future,” the statement said.

Sammie Rentz opened the Viet Huong Supermarket less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Hyundai site six months ago and said he worries business may not bounce back after falling off sharply since the raid.

“I’m concerned. Koreans are very proud people, and I bet they’re not appreciating what just happened. I’m worried about them cutting and running, or starting an exit strategy,"" he said.

The raid reportedly resulted in at least 475 workers detained, many of whom were South Korean nationals — including some with legal status. It is the largest raid ever conducted in recent history at a single work site.

In response, the American Immigration Council issued the following commentary.

“These raids don’t make anyone safer. They terrorize workers, destabilize communities, and push families into chaos,” said Michelle Lapointe, legal director at the American Immigration Council, who is based in the Atlanta, Georgia area. “This historic raid may make dramatic headlines, but it does nothing to fix the problems in our broken immigration system: a lack of legal pathways and a misguided focus on punishing workers and families who pose no threat to our communities. Raiding work sites isn’t reform, it’s political theater at the expense of families, communities, and our economy.”

“Immigrant workers are the backbone of our economy, filling critical labor gaps in manufacturing and beyond. Nationwide, 5.7% of manufacturing workers are undocumented, and here in Georgia they make up 6.7% of that workforce. Raiding worksites instead of fixing our pathways to legal employment is cruel, wasteful, and deeply shortsighted. The chilling effect of these raids will make it less likely that people will show up to work, deepening labor shortages and hitting businesses hard at an already precarious economic moment,” said Nan Wu, director of research at the American Immigration Council.

By linking deportation to DUIs, H.R.
Consequences of Detention and Deportation If enacted, H.R.","On June 26, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 875, the “Protect Our Communities From DUIs Act.” While framed as a key tool for public safety, the bill could be one of the most far-reaching expansions of deportation grounds for our immigrant communities in recent history. If enacted, the bill would make driving while intoxicated or impaired a deportable and inadmissible offense, granting DHS/ICE expanded authority in an ongoing push to deport as many people as possible. Like the Laken Riley Act, H.R. 875 shows how public safety rhetoric is used to deepen the ties between the criminal legal system and immigration enforcement.

Although Representative Barry Moore (AL-01) authored the bill as a “common sense” approach to protect against drunk drivers, DUIs already carry severe immigration consequences. Under current law, a single misdemeanor DUI could not only trigger the revocation of a student or employee visa but also bar eligibility for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and asylum. If a controlled substance is involved, the immigration consequences escalate to prolonged ICE detention that can last months or years. H.R. 875 would go even further: elevating a DUI arrest to the same level as the most serious offenses, such as drug trafficking or murder. The bill would dramatically expand who faces these penalties to include legal residents who have lived in the U.S. for decades, and even survivors of crimes. H.R. 875 would also coincide with the more than $170 billion investment in immigration enforcement, making these agencies the most highly funded law enforcement agencies in the country. If enacted, the bill would dramatically contribute to family separation, travel restrictions, and detention in horrendous conditions.

Immigration Enforcement and DUIs

Over recent decades, the convergence of criminal and immigration law, referred to as “crimmigration,” has entangled immigration enforcement within everyday policing. Since 2002, ICE has entered 287(g) agreements with local agencies, authorizing officers to screen detainees in jails and enforce immigration laws in their jurisdictions. Notoriously, under Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Maricopa County deputies routinely used race as an unconstitutional pretext to stop, detain, and arrest Latinx drivers, who were up to 9x more likely to be pulled over. By 2012, the Obama Administration phased out this “deputization” model, citing civil rights concerns. Under the Trump Administration, 287(g) agreements have surged from 135 in 16 states to over 700 across 40 states in five months. By linking deportation to DUIs, H.R. 875 would widen the net of immigration enforcement, extending it through traffic stops and sobriety checkpoints conducted by local officers.

Police discretion allows officers to initiate stops based on subjective judgment, such as perceived behavior, driver appearance, or vehicle condition. These decisions result in Latinx and Black drivers being stopped at higher rates, even when their driving mirrors that of white drivers. In an analysis of nearly 100 million cases nationwide, the Stanford Open Policing Project found racialized patterns in stops, searches, and seizures. By giving officers another basis for stops, H.R. 875 would heighten the risk of detainment and deportation of noncitizen drivers.

Checkpoints provide another avenue for discriminatory enforcement, as officers have broad discretion to stop or wave drivers through. At a Tennessee Highway Patrol sobriety checkpoint, officers pulled over driver Chelsea White and her husband, Hilario Martínez García; while White was released, Martínez García was detained and swiftly deported to Mexico. This case illustrates how checkpoints can sweep up drivers and passengers alike, putting immigrant community members at risk. Additionally, checkpoint locations are not random. In Chicago, 84 percent of checkpoints occurred in predominantly Black or Latinx neighborhoods, while predominantly white areas with more DUI incidents were overlooked. These placements deviate from guidelines that recommend placing checkpoints based on objective factors, such as the rate of alcohol-related crashes. H.R. 875 would expand officers’ authority in ways that disproportionately affect immigrant drivers and passengers.

Consequences of Detention and Deportation

If enacted, H.R. 875 would deepen the climate of fear and insecurity already experienced by immigrant communities. Immigrant families facing detention or deportation lose income overnight, pushing them into financial crises, food insecurity, and the threat of eviction.

This fear of deportation ripples outward, undermining trust in vital institutions like hospitals. Immigrant families often avoid or delay medical care, hesitate to send their children to school, and isolate themselves out of fear of surveillance or separation. In Los Angeles, recent ICE raids have made families too afraid to access basic health services or attend school in person. After recent wildfires, parents even delayed lead testing for their children due to these fears. Instead of promoting public safety, H.R. 875 will endanger public health by fueling distrust and uncertainty already weighing on immigrant communities.

Fear is intensified by the opacity of the detention system itself. Detained loved ones who abruptly disappear can be impossible to locate, leaving relatives in torment before learning where they are being held. Once located, detainees are subjected to inhumane conditions that immigration and legal advocates have long documented: sexual abuse, malnourishment, mental suffering, and medical neglect. Alarmingly, recent deaths in ICE custody have made 2025 one of the deadliest years in immigration detention.

Current enforcement already has harmful impacts on immigrant families. By broadening the grounds for deportation and tying immigration enforcement even more tightly to local policing through discriminatory traffic stops and DUI checkpoints, the bill will enable wider enforcement. The result would be more family separation, deeper distrust in public institutions, worsening public health outcomes, and policies that criminalize rather than support the inclusion of immigrant communities.",https://dornsife.usc.edu/eri/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2025/09/Blog_post_header_duitodeportation2-1024x589.png,N,,2025-09-06 02:56:22.915459

Recently, there have been numerous reports of ICE pulling over cars, questioning occupants, and taking people away in handcuffs in Troy and Rensselaer County. ICE agents have also been reported waiting outside homes early in the morning to confront individuals about their immigration status. In July, a Troy resident was detained and deported by ICE after applying for a green card, leaving behind his U.S. citizen wife and infant son. On July 7, video footage shared by the Troy Capital Region Sanctuary Coalition showed ICE agents escorting a man into an agency vehicle after being pulled over and questioned in front of City Hall.

Since February, at least 36 detainments have been reported in Troy, two in East Greenbush, and one green card deportation. These incidents have instilled fear among migrant community members, causing children to stay home from school and parents to be too scared to leave their homes for work.

Trump reacts to a bad week Trump greeted the waves of bad news with a characteristic mix of deflection, finger-pointing and anger.","Facing viral rumors of his imminent death, President Trump emerged in the Oval Office on Tuesday alive and scowling. Core tenets of his economic policies were under strain. Flashy diplomatic overtures to Moscow appeared to be backfiring. And a scandal over a notorious sexual abuser that has fixated his base was roaring back to life in Washington.

It was a challenging week for the president, whose aggressive approach to his second term has begun to hit significant roadblocks with the public and the courts, and overseas, with longstanding U.S. adversaries Trump once hoped to coax to his will.

The president called for an expedited Supreme Court review of an appellate court ruling that he had exceeded his authority by issuing sweeping global tariffs last spring — a decision that, if left standing, could upend the foundation of his economic agenda. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued jobs numbers showing a contraction of the labor market in July, a first since the depths of the pandemic in 2020.

New art lining a hallway in the West Wing features photographs of Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump said the Russian president had agreed to meet with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to discuss an end to the war. Yet, three weeks on, Russia had launched its most intense bombardment of Kyiv in years, and Putin traveled to Beijing for a military parade hosted by Xi Jinping, which Russian state media used to mock the U.S. president.

During an appearance in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, Trump said reaching a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine has turned out to be “a little bit more difficult” than he initially thought.

And a rare spree of bipartisanship broke out on Capitol Hill — in opposition to Trump’s causes.

A tense hearing at the Senate Finance Committee with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. laid bare concern over the direction of federal vaccination policy and public health recommendations under his leadership across party lines.

Trump declined to stand behind him wholeheartedly after the hearing. “He’s got some little different ideas,” Trump told reporters, adding: “It’s not your standard talk.”

On Wednesday, moments after a group of more than 100 women pleaded for Trump’s help from the steps of the Capitol seeking transparency over the investigation of their alleged abuser, Jeffrey Epstein, Trump dismissed the matter as a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats.

“The Department of Justice has done its job, they have given everything requested of them,” Trump repeated on Truth Social on Friday. “It’s time to end the Democrat Epstein Hoax.”

Trump was close friends with Epstein for more than a decade. But his base has repeatedly called for the release of thousands of files in his case — and some of Trump’s staunchest allies in Congress are set to vote against his wishes for a discharge petition directing the Justice Department to do so in the coming days.

A far-right political activist released hidden camera footage this week of a Justice Department official claiming the agency would redact the names of Republicans, but not Democrats, identified in the files. In the video, the DOJ official also suggested that Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell was recently moved to a lower-security prison as part of a deal to keep her quiet.

Public support for Trump has appeared stable since July, with roughly 42% of Americans approving of his job performance across a series of high quality polls. But the end of the August recess in Washington — and the oncoming flu and COVID-19 season — could return public attention to subjects that have proved politically perilous for the president this week.

Polls show that a majority of the president’s Republican voters support vaccines. They oppose Putin and increasingly support Ukraine. And across the political spectrum, Americans want the Epstein files released, unredacted and in full.

A string of court losses

The president’s agenda suffered several setbacks this week, as federal judges across the country ruled his administration had broken the law in various instances.

In San Francisco, a federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of military troops in Los Angeles was illegal and barred soldiers from aiding immigration arrests in California in an order set to take effect next week.

In Boston, a federal judge said the Trump administration broke the law when it froze billions of dollars in research funds awarded to Harvard University. In another court ruling, a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting dozens of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala.

And on Friday afternoon, a federal judge stopped the Trump administration from taking away the deportation protections under Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and Haitians living in the United States.

While the court decisions represent a snag for key portions of the administration’s agenda, the cases continue to play out in court — and could ultimately turn in favor of Trump.

Legal experts are closely watching those decisions. In the case of the military troop deployments, for instance, some fear a reversal on appeal could ultimately hand the president broader power to send troops to American cities.

Trump has floated additional federal deployments — to Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans — in recent days.

Trump reacts to a bad week

Trump greeted the waves of bad news with a characteristic mix of deflection, finger-pointing and anger.

He warned that losing his appeal on tariff policy at the Supreme Court would render the United States a “third world country,” telling reporters, “if we don’t win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly.” And he said he was “very disappointed” in Putin.

After the parade in Beijing — which was also attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, a longstanding U.S. ally now ostracized by Trump’s tariffs — drew widespread media attention, Trump wrote on social media that the countries were conspiring together against the United States.

“We’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China,” he wrote.

In another lengthy social media post on Friday, Trump accused Democrats of fueling the Epstein “hoax” as a means to “distract from the great success of a Republican President.”

Days earlier, survivors of Epstein’s sexual abuse publicly pressured lawmakers to back a legislative measure to force the release of the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier.

“This is about ending secrecy wherever abuse of power takes root,” said Anouska De Georgiou, who was among the Epstein victims who held a news conference on Capitol Hill.

A few high-profile Republicans also broke with Trump on the Epstein issue, calling for more transparency on the investigation. Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she is willing to expose those who are tied to Epstein’s sex trafficking case.

On a phone call with Trump on Wednesday morning, Greene suggested he meet with Epstein’s victims at the White House while they were gathered in town. He was noncommittal, the congresswoman told reporters.

The survivors left town without a meeting. At the direction of the White House, Republican leadership continues to press Republican members to oppose efforts to release the files.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d299136/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5721x3004+0+405/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F6c%2Fe3e33e8c4c81963df82727aa2497%2F58309bc2ea7040e682f621faa558400c.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 23:56:36.419083

It was shortly after 10 a.m. when prosecutors said a squad of federal agents arrested Stover in a Downers Grove apartment parking lot. The FBI Chicago posted photos online taken of agents with the Joint Terrorism Task Force during the encounter.

According to a criminal complaint unsealed late Friday afternoon, Stover is accused of writing multiple threatening social media posts, including threats to kill ICE agents earlier this year, as well as threats against the U.S. President.

""The us president just said he wants to purpose build concentration camps for his political enemies,"" Stover allegedly wrote online back in April. ""Its war right here and now against this attacker or we die in slavery. Put down your posters and selfie sticks and pick up a weapon!""

Prosecutors also accused Stover of posting a photo in February of ""five rifle bullets- with the first names of five well-known U.S. political figures respectively written with marker on each bullet-placed on top of two hunting knives.""

Stover's social media activity had been monitored by the FBI's National Threat Operations Center for months, and the agency contacted the U.S. Secret Service to launch an investigation this past May.

On May 7, court records state Downers Grove police and the FBI ""entered a Clear and Present Danger request for Stover with the Illinois State Police (ISP)"" and the ISP revoked Stover's Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) Card, a state card that allows a person to possess or acquire firearms.

The next day, federal prosecutors said Downers Grove police responded to a 911 domestic-disturbance call at Stover's residence.

When they knocked on his door, investigators said Stover ""opened the door for officers, immediately shut it, then opened the door again with his hands in the air and an empty holster, a pocketknife, and a full magazine on his hip.""

No charges were filed in relation to the domestic-disturbance call, but given Stover's possession of multiple firearms and his FOID card revocation the day prior, he was placed under arrest.

According to prosecutors, Downers Grove police seized six handguns, five rifles, a shotgun, and ammunition, including the five rifle rounds with the first names of ""well-known U.S. political figures.""

Stover was ultimately released after state prosecutors declined to charge him with unlawful firearm possession.

After he was released, Stover was interviewed by a Downers Grove Crisis Intervention Sergeant and the FBI, in which he ""he expressed frustration about global affairs and the U.S. government.""

But prosecutors say the police encounter did not stop Stover from posting threats on social media.

He was active on his Blue Sky account, using exceedingly extreme language in his posts, court records show.

""ICE is a terrorist organization,"" Stover allegedly wrote in a July 7 post cited in his criminal complaint. ""Share this if you think we should shoot them down like dogs.""

At his first court appearance, Stover told the U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge David Weisman that he was employed and worked in ""air conditioning.""

Stover has not entered a plea to the federal charge he faces.

Given the violent and serious nature to the post, federal prosecutors asked that Stover remain in federal custody until a future detention hearing is held.

That detention hearing is scheduled for Sept. 10.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17751863_090525-wls-rivera-iteam-ice-threats-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-05 23:56:56.460879

These amendments would enhance congressional oversight over President Trump’s expansive use of the military for law enforcement operations in American cities, including without the consent or request of a state’s elected officials.

“Deploying the military to Chicago without the request or consent of Illinois’ elected leaders is a clear violation of the law by the President. Chicago does not need to be ‘saved’ by President Trump, and this is nothing more than a shameless scare tactic,” said Durbin. “President Trump continues to abuse his power as Commander in Chief, but Senator Duckworth and I are pushing for stronger oversight over his actions.”

“I’m proud to join Senator Durbin in sponsoring these amendments that will help ensure our military can remain focused on its core missions and prevent Donald Trump—or any President—from politicizing and misusing our Armed Forces for their own gain,” said Duckworth. “Forcing the military, uninvited, into our cities to intimidate Americans in their own communities does not make our nation stronger, it simply distracts the military from executing its core mission of keeping our nation safe from real adversaries who wish us harm. Trump’s threats against Chicago are more unwarranted, unwanted and unjust moves straight out of the authoritarian’s playbook that will only jeopardize civil rights, undermine our military’s readiness and ultimately weaken our national security.”

The amendments that Durbin and Duckworth announced include:

Amendment #3028 to curb misuses of military bases, installations and facilities for detentions by prohibiting the use of any military construction funds to construct, renovate or expand any facility forthe purposes of detaining migrants.

Amendment #3209 to draw a bright line between military and policing by prohibiting individuals from simultaneously serving as an employee in the Department of Defense and in any civilian law enforcement entity, except if they are members of the Reserves and National Guard and hold law enforcement roles solely in their civilian capacities.

Amendment #3210 to protect civil rights and prevent misuse of military by requiring the President to notify Congress and justify in writing before providing access to military equipment—including surveillance equipment—bases or facilities to support law enforcement, and require Congressional approval to extend any such support longer than 30 days. This amendment would make it harder forPresident Trump to use military bases for detention, provide military surveillance equipment to support police or DHS, and claim it is legal to deploy the military to American cities because they are only in support roles to law enforcement. In recent months, the Trump Administration has dedicated expensive DOD platforms, assets and facilities for support to law enforcement, including designating military bases in five states for DHS support, including Ft. Bliss which was once used for Japanese internment, and pulling expensive military systems away from their normal missions to assist DHS with surveillance within the United States along the border.

Amendment #3596 to prohibit DoD non-reimbursable support to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the purposes of immigration enforcement activities. The Trump Administration’s expansive use of the military for immigration operations, both domestically and overseas at Guantánamo Bay, has raised significant civil liberties concerns and risks eroding trust in the military. It is also a costly diversion of military resources that undermines readiness, as the Department of Defense (DOD) has provided such immigration enforcement support to DHS on a non-reimbursable basis, effectively forsaking the intent behind such Congressionally directed defense funds.

Amendment #3774 to prohibit the use of DoD funds for any activities that would violate the Posse Comitatus Act or that would infringe on powers reserved to the States under the Constitution.

Amendment #3775 to ensure applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act on the National Guard. This amendment would close an unintended loophole President Trump has abused to deploy National Guard troops across state lines for law enforcement support and absent invocation of emergency authorities under the Insurrection Act.

Amendment #3773 to prohibit the use of funds for any DoD deployment of National Guard forces under Title 32 authorities in a state or federal territory over the objections of the chief executive.

Both Durbin and Duckworth have repeatedly spoken out against President Trump’s threats to deploy troops and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to Chicago. Earlier this week, Durbin and Duckworth led Illinois delegation members in demanding that President Trump abandon his plans to deploy the military to the city, and the Senators wrote to the leaders of DOJ, DHS, DOD, and the FBI to request information about the Trump Administration’s plans to send federal agents and troops to Chicago. After reports surfaced that DOD planned to use Naval Station Great Lakes to enable operations by ICE officers, the Senators requested a meeting with the Secretary of the Navy. The Senators visited Naval Station Great Lakes earlier today.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Duckworth also successfully secured the following amendments in the NDAA that the Committee approved in July and are set to be considered by the full Senate:

Language to strengthen public trust of the military and enhance civil rights by requiring that servicemembers identify themselves as part of the military when assisting federal law enforcement in the United States. As the Trump Administration continues to send federal agents and our nation’s military into our communities to intimidate their fellow Americans, this provision ensures that servicemembers identify themselves properly—to avoid public misunderstanding about who is providing logistical support versus conducting arrests or law enforcement duties.

Ensure all servicemembers know their legal obligations during deployments both at home and abroad by mandating legal training to all servicemembers, including a refresher within 90 days of any mobilization or deployment, on their responsibilities under the law of armed conflict, rules of engagement, defense support for civil authorities and standing rules for the use of force within the United States. In light of the Trump Administration’s increasing use of troops to support law enforcement within the United States, this provision will ensure troops know how to responsibly operate within the bounds of domestic laws and protect American civil rights.

In a message from a state spokesperson, 13News confirmed that the deployment would be restricted to Indiana, but it would range across the state.

""Indiana National Guard personnel will not conduct law enforcement functions and will not make arrests,"" the spokesperson said.

""Indiana National Guard troops supporting ICE are scheduled to conduct in-processing and training, and are scheduled to be on duty by mid-September,"" the spokesperson said.

The Indiana National Guard is not currently tasked to mobilize to either Chicago or Baltimore.

The deployment of Indiana National Guard is part of a nationwide deployment of state national guards to support ICE operations.

It is separate from the thousands of guardsmen deployed in Washington, D.C. and expected in other Democrat-controlled cities across the country.

The news of the deployment was reported in late August, and Indianapolis-based immigration attorney John Broyels said the immigrant community is struggling.

""The anxiety level is off the charts,"" Broyels said. ""Clients are very anxious about what the future holds for them.""

""When you bring new people in that have no training or experience handling these matters and don't know the detention standards and rights of the inmate, you are going to have mistakes made,"" Broyels said.

Broyels said immigration laws exist for a reason, but he said the ""massive expansion"" is causing problems.

USCIS, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), screens and processes green card and citizenship applications.
“USCIS should be fairly adjudicating people’s applications for services,” Doug Rand, a former USCIS senior official during the Biden administration, told NBC News.
In August, DHS proposed a rule to limit the amount of time that foreign-born reporters, academics, students, physicians, and others can stay in the United States.
The Trump administration has also been targeting people who show up at courthouses or USCIS offices for immigration appointments.","U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is planning to recruit and train special agents who will be able to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute warrants against people who have allegedly violated immigration laws.

A final rule published today in the federal register authorizes the director of USCIS to conduct “law enforcement activities to enforce civil and criminal violations of immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS.” The rule is effective on October 6.

USCIS, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), screens and processes green card and citizenship applications. The agency also administers a number of programs, including those for people who seek to work in the United States, as well as humanitarian programs for victims of certain crimes and people who have been displaced by catastrophes in their home country, among others.

“This historic moment will better address immigration crimes, hold those that perpetrate immigration fraud accountable, and act as a force multiplier for DHS and our federal law enforcement partners, including the Joint Terrorism Task Force,” USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow said in a press release. (During his Senate confirmation hearing, Edlow, a former visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025, told lawmakers that “USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.”)

The rule states that: “The law enforcement authorities delegated to the Director of USCIS include, but are not limited to, the authority to investigate alleged civil and criminal violations of the immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS, issue and execute both search and arrest warrants, detain and remove aliens, and make recommendations for prosecutions or other appropriate action when deemed advisable.”

Previously, these duties were “only delegated to ICE and CBP regarding the enforcement of immigration laws.”

As per the new rule, the director of USCIS “will grant individuals or a class of individuals the authority to use non-deadly force, deadly force (in situations where the designated immigration officer or other persons are in danger), and initiate a vehicular pursuit to apprehend fleeing suspects who are attempting to avoid apprehension.”

DHS did not provide public notice or hold a public comment period for the rule, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming that the “normal notice and comment procedures do not apply” as the changes “do nothing more than organize internal DHS operations.” The rule, however, fundamentally changes USCIS’s role in the immigration system.

“USCIS should be fairly adjudicating people’s applications for services,” Doug Rand, a former USCIS senior official during the Biden administration, told NBC News. “It should not be scaring people from applying for services in the first place.”

DHS has made a number of changes to limit people’s pathways to live, study, and work in the United States. In August, DHS proposed a rule to limit the amount of time that foreign-born reporters, academics, students, physicians, and others can stay in the United States. Those who wish to stay longer than that time frame would have to apply to USCIS, “therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS,” according to DHS’s press release.

If adopted, the rule, DHS said, “will limit the amount of time that foreign students, professors, physicians, and other visa holders are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting.”

Also last month, USCIS announced that it will consider “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations” and “evidence of antisemitic activity” when reviewing noncitizens’ applications to live and work in the United States. The Trump administration has used baseless accusations of antisemitism to attempt to deport foreign-born pro-Palestine student activists, including Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil, who has a green card.

The Trump administration has also been targeting people who show up at courthouses or USCIS offices for immigration appointments. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has reported that ICE has been arresting people when they come to USCIS for biometrics appointments, interviews for I-130 petitions (forms filed by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor their family members), and interviews for green card applications.

“[T]hese arrests are preventing eligible individuals from being approved for lawful status,” the organization wrote in a policy brief published in August.

“The ICE arrests taking place at USCIS field offices across the country are inefficient, undermine the legal immigration process, and unnecessarily separate families,” the brief continues. “Current ICE actions not only undermine trust in the system but also punish those who are actively trying to comply with the law.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-5-hands-holding-USCIS.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:57:05.528082

The Trump administration’s complaint centers around the doctrine of preemption, which holds that federal law may displace state law if the state law frustrates a purpose or objective of a federal law or inappropriately encroaches on an area that has been specifically reserved for the federal government.

Immigration has consistently been deemed a province of the federal government. For instance, 8 US Code § 1373 states that no official may “prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.”

The complaint alleges that the Boston Trust Act “is at cross-purposes with that congressional design,” specifically the portions that preclude local officials from “[p]roviding personal information … regarding a person’s release date or time to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency … solely for the purpose of enforcing civil violations of United States immigration laws.”

A Department of Justice press release condemned Boston’s sanctuary policies—policies that tend to inhibit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said that “[i]f Boston won’t protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.”

In response to Bondi’s letter “threatening to prosecute local officials” for failing to partake in “mass deportations,” Mayor Wu maintained that Boston’s actions are completely consistent with federal law:

The City of Boston follows the law—local, state, and federal. The United States Constitution establishes that local governments, closest to the people, hold the authority to enact public safety policies without the threat of unlawful interference from the federal government.

Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira has lived in the United States for most of his life and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection, according to lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Singleton Schreiber LLP, a private national firm with a New Mexico presence working with the ACLU.

DACA is a status conferred through a 2012 federal law that affords immigrants who were brought to the United States as children protection from being deported for renewable two-year periods.

Gamez Lira is a father of four and married to a United States citizen. According to the lawsuit, as well as surveillance video obtained by news outlet ElPasoYa, masked federal immigrant agents arrested him in his driveway in Horizon City, Texas, on Aug. 13 with two of his children in the car. The arrest resulted in a dislocated shoulder, according to the lawsuit.

NM Gov announces Oct. 1 special session on federal cuts to healthcare, nutrition, public media

The lawsuit filed Wednesday names Homeland Security Kristi Noem and US Attorney General Pam Bondi, along with other federal officials and Dora Castro, the Otero County Processing Center warden. No defendant has yet responded in court.

Earlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS told NPR that DACA recipients “are not automatically protected from deportations” and that they should leave the United States voluntarily.

Gamez Lira is being held at the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral, New Mexico, a facility that houses the majority of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees held in New Mexico. The ACLU alleges he faces “indefinite detention” at the facility, according to the news release.

“Paulo has worked hard to build a dignified and meaningful life in the United States. He is a committed father of U.S. citizen children, and this is the only home he has ever known,” said ACLU-NM Senior Staff Attorney Becca Sheff in a statement. “It’s unconscionable for the government to hold Paulo indefinitely in an ICE detention center known for dangerous and degrading conditions, especially since his status as a DACA recipient protects him from being deported.”

Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

The lawyers filed a similar petition on behalf of Catalina “Xóchitl” Santiago, another 28-year-old DACA recipient, who has been held in detention in West Texas for more than a month, according to the news release. The petitions allege the detainees are being held in violation of their constitutional rights to due process, along with other violations.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment, saying the agency does not comment on pending federal litigation.

The detention center where Gamez Lira is held has an average daily population of about 850 ICE detainees, according to the latest figures. A group of mostly Republican lawmakers visited the facility recently, part of an effort to push their Democratic colleagues and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham not to ban ICE detention facilities in New Mexico.

What Recent Policy Changes Have Paved the Way for Military Lawyers to Serve as Immigration Judges?
Permanent immigration judges undergo a rigorous training curriculum, which includes at least one year of mentorship with an experienced immigration judge.
Given the short 6-month terms, temporary immigration judges won’t have time to become experts in immigration law.
Second, Congress could improve its oversight of the hiring practices of immigration judges given this new workforce for immigration adjudications.","This week, the Department of Defense (DOD) approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges—which would double the total number of immigration judges at the Department of Justice. This is yet another example of the Trump administration diverting military resources away from national security and instead toward its mass deportation agenda.

Temporary immigration judges are meant to support, not supplant, permanent immigration judges and are only allowed to serve 6-month renewable terms. The DOD’s decision comes days after the DOJ—which oversees the immigration court system—significantly watered down the requirements to serve as a temporary immigration judge.

What Recent Policy Changes Have Paved the Way for Military Lawyers to Serve as Immigration Judges?

On August 28, the DOJ published a final rule that eliminated certain requirements to serve as a temporary immigration judge. Previously, to be a temporary judge, a candidate must have served (1) as a former immigration judge or appellate immigration judge, (2) as an administrative judge within another executive branch agency, or (3) as a DOJ attorney with at least 10 years of immigration law experience.

The Trump administration removed those requirements and now the DOJ can select any attorney to serve as a temporary immigration judge, including military attorneys and attorneys from the private sector with no immigration experience.

The Trump administration claims that more immigration judges are necessary to address the immigration court backlog. But in the past seven months, the Trump administration itself has fired or laid off more than 100 permanent immigration judges—taking the DOJ from a high of 735 judges at the end of FY 2024, to about 600 now.

What Harms Could Result From Reassigning Military Lawyers to Serve as Immigration Judges?

Temporary immigration judges could be more susceptible to political influence than permanent judges. Several recently fired immigration judges have stated that DOJ is telling them how to make decisions in a case, and the Trump administration has terminated judges for not aligning with its mass deportation goals. Given that temporary immigration judges only serve for 6-month renewable terms and are subject to review before any renewal is made, the Trump administration could easily choose to keep only those judges that have ruled the way the administration wants.

Training alone won’t address the problems with appointing unqualified attorneys as temporary immigration judges. The DOJ states in its final rule that temporary immigration judges will be subject to the “same” training as permanent hires, but that’s not enough. Permanent immigration judges undergo a rigorous training curriculum, which includes at least one year of mentorship with an experienced immigration judge. But the immigration system is complex and becoming more complex by the day. Given the short 6-month terms, temporary immigration judges won’t have time to become experts in immigration law.

This diversion of military lawyers further undermines due process. Reassigning military lawyers who lack experience and understanding in immigration law to serve as immigration adjudicators further blurs the line between independent administrative courts and presidential policies. It increases the risk that people facing life-altering consequences of detention and deportation will be deprived of the little due process they are entitled to in immigration proceedings.

What To Look for as Immigration Courts Start Turning to Military Lawyers for Adjudications?

First, lawyers are still examining the legality of this new decision which may result in litigation. The DOD’s decision to allow active-duty military attorneys to serve as immigration judges could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of “any part” of the military to “execute the laws” of the United States.

Second, Congress could improve its oversight of the hiring practices of immigration judges given this new workforce for immigration adjudications. Since 2019, Congress has used the appropriations process to monitor hiring practices of immigration judges, but advocates have proposed strengthening this oversight.

Finally, Congress should ensure that any future reform of the U.S. immigration system includes protections against the politicization of immigration courts we are currently experiencing.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-doj-military-attorney-judge.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 17:57:03.595067

Temporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States, if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

Designations are granted for terms of six, twelve or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work.

At the South Texas ICE Processing Center, at least four emergency calls since January have reportedly referenced sexual abuse,” the report said.
And because Sen. Ossoff’s investigation of abuses in immigration detention is ongoing, further credible reports are likely to come.
“Records of hundreds of emergency calls from ICE detention centers obtained by WIRED—including audio recordings—show a system inundated by life-threatening incidents, delayed treatment, and overcrowding,” the outlet reported in June.
The Marshall Project newly reports that as the administration is seeking to expand immigration detention, it’s rapidly “raising troubling facilities” with a history of abuses “from the dead” in order to get more space.","“One attorney reported that a U.S. citizen child with severe medical issues was hospitalized three times while in CBP custody with her non-citizen mother, and that when the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report said. But in response, a guard simply said to “just give the girl a cracker.”

An ongoing investigation led by Georgia’s senior senator has uncovered hundreds of credible reports of shocking human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities, including dozens of allegations of physical and sexual abuse and the mistreatment of pregnant women and children as young as two, including U.S. citizens.

The probe, led by Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, details more than 500 credible human rights abuses in immigration detention, including 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse, 32 reports of abuses against pregnant women and kids, reports of denial of health care and legal representation, and even punitive solitary confinement – which is considered torture by many experts – for reporting allegations at facilities in more than two dozen states, Puerto Rico, and even U.S. military bases in Cuba and as far away as Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.

“Public reports describe at least two 911 calls from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California referencing reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults. At the South Texas ICE Processing Center, at least four emergency calls since January have reportedly referenced sexual abuse,” the report said. At the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas, one detained individual was slammed so hard against the ground “for stepping out of line in the dining hall” that guards “reportedly nearly broke his wrists.”

Both the Adelanto ICE Processing Center and the South Texas ICE Processing Center are operated by GEO Group, one of a number of private prisons set to reap massive profits under the administration’s anti-immigrant dragnet. And they’ve made perfectly clear they know on which side their bread is buttered. GEO Group was the first corporation to max out to Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, and subsequently used a subsidiary to donate a combined $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC.

The human misery that now fills the pockets of private prison executives aligned with the agenda of the administration has not spared the most vulnerable, either.

“The partner of a woman in DHS custody reported to the Senator’s staff that the woman was pregnant and bled for days before facility staff would take her to a hospital,” the report said. “Once she was there, she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours. In another case, a detainee reportedly ‘nearly miscarried twice’ while in ICE custody.”

“One attorney reported that a U.S. citizen child with severe medical issues was hospitalized three times while in CBP custody with her non-citizen mother, and that when the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report continued. But in response, a guard simply said to “just give the girl a cracker.” In this disturbing pattern targeting sick children, a four-year-old child receiving ongoing treatment for cancer was also detained and subsequently deported “without the ability to consult a doctor.”

“Detainees have reported being beaten by detention facility staff and placed in solitary confinement after reporting their abuse,” the report said. The intent is clear. Human rights experts have stated that solitary confinement is tantamount to torture and can even be lethal.

And because Sen. Ossoff’s investigation of abuses in immigration detention is ongoing, further credible reports are likely to come. But as the report notes, Congressional oversight seeking to shine a light on these abuses has been impeded by the administration, which has sought to unlawfully block lawmakers from doing their jobs, as a recent lawsuit from members of Congress states. The administration claims that members must give at least 72 hours notice of any visits, but that’s entirely made up. Federal law permits them to visit unannounced as part of their oversight responsibilities.

“Regardless of our views on immigration policy, the American people do not support the abuse of detainees and prisoners,” Sen. Ossoff told NBC News, adding that “it’s more important than ever to shine a light on what’s happening behind bars and barbed wire, especially and most shockingly to children.”

Other recent reports show that abuses within immigration detention are part of an escalating pattern under Trump and mass deportation architect-in-chief Stephen Miller’s crusade to purge the country of non-white people. “Records of hundreds of emergency calls from ICE detention centers obtained by WIRED—including audio recordings—show a system inundated by life-threatening incidents, delayed treatment, and overcrowding,” the outlet reported in June.

“The data, obtained through public records requests, show that at least 60 percent of the centers analyzed had reported serious pregnancy complications, suicide attempts, or sexual assault allegations,” WIRED reported. “Since January, these 10 facilities have collectively placed nearly 400 emergency calls. Nearly 50 of those have involved potential cardiac episodes, 26 referenced seizures, and 17 reported head injuries. Seven calls described suicide attempts or self-harm, including overdoses and hangings. Six others involved allegations of sexual abuse—including at least one case logged as ‘staff on detainee.’”

And the following month, visiting lawmakers decried Florida’s Everglades detention camp and described the site as an “internment camp” where immigrants have been “packed” into what are essentially human holding pens. “Wall-to-wall humans. 32 detainees per cage,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL-25). Another visiting lawmaker, Rep. Maxwell Frost (FL-10), called conditions at the detention camp abhorrent. “When those doors opened .. what I saw made my heart sink.”

Following landmark legal action led by environmental and indigenous groups, a federal judge “banned the arrival of new detainees and ordered a winding down of operations within 60 days,” Friends of the Everglades said. However, an appeals court has since put that order on hold. Litigation around the detention camp remains ongoing as reporting has revealed that as Floridians continue to struggle with living costs, their state wasted more than $200 million on the project.

But as the end of one inhumane detention site could possibly be within reach, others are popping up in its place. The Marshall Project newly reports that as the administration is seeking to expand immigration detention, it’s rapidly “raising troubling facilities” with a history of abuses “from the dead” in order to get more space.

“In Louisiana, where many immigrants arrested across the country are being held, the state closed several prisons after sentencing and parole reform allowed it to shrink the incarcerated population,” the report said. “But those empty buildings were repurposed, and now, seven of the nine ICE facilities there are former local prisons or jails.” And it means more money for private prison profiteers. In rural Michigan, one reopened detention site is being operated by GEO Group. “I think the rapidity of that reopening does speak to the chaotic environment that we always associate with the GEO Group and how they cut corners, and above all, they want to make money,” No Detention Centers in Michigan member JR Martin told The Marshall Project.",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/engin-akyurt-XJp8R7wimhg-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:57:11.677199

The courts are playing a central role in opposing the lawless Trump administration, but the core of the resistance are people–people at every level organized in opposition, defending democracy.","US President Donald Trump is on a losing streak this week. Just look at the latest judicial decisions challenging his policies, from mass deportations to tariffs to his troop deployments to US cities.

The courts are proving to be a significant check on Trump’s thirst for absolute power.

These cases illustrate the point:

Immigration

Over Labor Day weekend, Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to begin deporting up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. In the dead of night, the first children were loaded onto planes in south Texas. “These are unaccompanied children who do not have a parent or a guardian with them,” Efrén Olivares, an attorney representing the minors, said on the Democracy Now! news hour.

At 1:00 am on Sunday morning, Olivares and his colleagues filed an emergency complaint with the federal court in Washington, DC. Judge Sparkle Sooknanam was woken after 2:00 am, and by 4:00 am she issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations until the children had the immigration hearings to which they have a legal right.

Meanwhile in Texas, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation’s most conservative, ruled that Trump’s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport people was illegal.

Tariffs

The Appeals Court in Washington DC ruled that Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were illegal and unconstitutional, noting that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs. The ruling was “a sweeping decision that unequivocally rebukes President Trump’s idea that he can impose tariffs on American consumers on his own,” Neal Katyal, the attorney who argued the case, said on Democracy Now!

Domestic Deployment of the Military

Trump says, “We’re going in,” threatening to invade Chicago using, among other forces, the Texas National Guard.

But in California, a federal judge, invoking the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act that bars the use of military in domestic law enforcement, ruled in favor of Gov. Gavin Newsom, finding Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles, along with several hundred US Marines, was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of retired US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from “deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops [from] engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

These are just a few of the recent court cases that have rebuked Trump as he attempts to subvert the US Constitution.

We recently got a personal glimpse into what judicial wins over Trump look like. In the high mountain air of Telluride, Colorado, we had a chance to spend time with E. Jean Carroll, the renowned advice columnist and journalist. She was at the Telluride Film Festival for the premier of the new documentary, Ask E. Jean.

Carroll had a long and storied career as the advice columnist for Elle Magazine, and has published several books. In recent years she became known as one of the most prominent women to accuse Donald Trump of sexual abuse, saying he raped her in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s, in Manhattan.

The courts are playing a central role in opposing the lawless Trump administration, but the core of the resistance are people.

Carroll sued Trump in civil court, and a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing her. Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote, “Trump did in fact ‘rape’ Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood.” She was awarded a $5 million settlement from Trump. After the verdict, he called her a liar. She then sued for defamation, and won an additional jury award of $83.3 million.

Carroll cut an elegant figure, walking along Telluride’s main avenue with the sweeping Continental Divide as a backdrop. Her film premiered to rave reviews, and, should there remain a film distributor in this country not cowed by threats of lawsuits from Trump, it should be available for viewing by a wide audience. The film highlights the story of one courageous woman refusing to be defined as a victim of Donald Trump, providing inspiration, no doubt, to the hundreds of survivors of Trump’s old friend, the now-dead sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. Many of them spoke this week outside the US Capitol, demanding the full release of the Epstein files. The Trump administration, which controls the files, is resisting.

Behind each lawsuit are impacted people, whether immigrant children pulled from their beds in the middle of the night and thrown on planes, or people standing up in the streets of LA confronting illegally deployed troops, whether sexual abuse survivors banding together, or federal workers fired en masse.

Politicians have warned of ramped up U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement efforts in the coming days, with federal agents expected to use the Naval Station Great Lakes on the North Shore and an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview.

Meanwhile, Chicago's popular El Grito fest was postponed over heightened concerns surrounding the enforcement efforts and Mexican Independence Day celebration organizers are on high alert following reports their events could be targeted.

Here's what we know so far:

Who is coming to Chicago?

National Guard

Despite a public back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the potential for National Guard deployment in Chicago, no official calls have been made so far.

Local

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott denied reports National Guard members from his state will be traveling to Chicago, contradicting comments from Pritzker earlier this week.

Pritzker had reportedly said ""we have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois."" But Abbott’s administration pushed back on those comments Wednesday, saying the state’s National Guard is not preparing for a deployment, while arguing that Pritzker and members of the Chicago City Council are “not in the loop” on any plans for federal intervention.

“Governor Abbott and the State of Texas are ready, willing, and able to deploy all necessary resources to clean up the streets of Chicago should President Trump call upon us to do so,” a spokesperson for Abbott told NBC Chicago.

Trump on Wednesday took a step back from talk of sending the National Guard to Chicago, saying Pritzker would have to ask for the assistance. The governor bluntly dismissed such an idea.

There is still a chance the president could pivot and attempt to send National Guard members to the city without a request from Pritzker, but President Donald Trump told reporters this week that he wanted to wait for such a call to come.

Trump had suggested during a Wednesday press conference that he would potentially explore sending National Guard members to Louisiana instead, but Pritzker said he has not seen any news of a redirection.

ICE

While the National Guard may not be deployed to Chicago, enhanced federal immigration enforcement operations are still expected.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village's roughly 8,000 residents that federal officials said a two-story building at 1930 Beach St. will be used for a ""large-scale"" immigration enforcement campaign led by the Trump administration. The campaign is set to last for approximately 45 days.

The letter also warned residents that protests and demonstrations near the building, ""like those seen earlier this year in Los Angeles, where property damage and assaults against law enforcement were reported,"" could occur.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

Immigration attorneys have previously told NBC Chicago that during the last round of scaled up ICE enforcement, it was difficult to make contact with their clients at the facility.

According to Pritzker, increased ICE enforcement in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs could begin as early as this weekend.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago.""

At least 300 federal agents expected to come to the Great Lakes Naval Base in North Chicago as part of the Trump Administration's enhanced operations from ICE, Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said.

A joint statement from the Lake County Government and the City of North Chicago Wednesday called the planned federal operations at the Naval Station ""unprecedented.""

""If the agents are stationed here in Lake County and they say they're going to be in Chicago, who's to say they won't come in to our community?,"" Rockingham Jr. said, who added that the community is approximately 40 percent Latino.

Pritzker said agents could be fully assembled by Friday, with operations beginning Saturday, though his office hasn't received official communication from the White House.

Last week, a report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

Mayor Rockingham said the agents will not be staying at the base, and will be housed at hotels in Lake County.

Protests begin

Protesters gathered Friday morning outside the Broadview ICE facility , calling for its closure.

The protests, which began at 7 a.m., featured groups citing the Illinois Way Forward Act.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,"" village administrator LeTisa Jones told the Associated Press. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

As of 7:15 a.m., several protesters had begun to gather in front of the center, with more arriving as the morning went on, some with signs, and a small police presence.

Mexican Independence Day celebrations

During his Tuesday press conference, Pritzker said he was ""deeply concerned"" that ICE will target Mexican Independence Day.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

In Chicago, organizers with El Grito, a popular Mexican Independence Day event slated for Sept. 13 and 14 in Grant Park, moved to postpone the festival due to the concerns.

""This was a painful decision; however, with the heightened political tensions and given our location in downtown Chicago, we need to keep our community safe,"" organizer German Gonzalez said in a statement Thursday. ""To proceed in spite of the advice we've received directly from city and state officials and potentially expose our community to becoming collateral damage would be irresponsible. That's a risk we are not willing to take.""

The city's iconic parade, however, remains planned as scheduled.

""The city of Chicago will celebrate the independence of Mexico the way it has done in the past,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson said. ""I know the president is working hard to intimidate, I’m not intimidated. No one should be.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/IMG_4807.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-05 18:57:07.897944

Given the backlog of pending removal cases, it’s time the immigration courts got some relief, but ignore any complaints you may hear about how complex immigration law is or any potential threats this plan may pose to “due process”.

A Historical Perspective on the Backlog

Having been an immigration judge myself, I am intimately familiar with this system.

When I left the bench to return to Capitol Hill in FY 2015, there were 254 immigration judges handling a docket of 659,000 cases — roughly 2,600 cases per immigration judge.

When Donald Trump took office in FY 2017, there were 84 more immigration judges on the bench, and they were handling nearly 896,000 cases — just about 2,650 cases each.

The then-president and his attorneys general (Jeff Sessions, Matt Whittaker, and Bill Barr) prioritized immigration judge hiring, and when Trump left office in FY 2021, the cadre of immigration judges had risen 65 percent to 559.

So far, so good, but the problem was that the immigration court backlog rose by 85 percent during that same period, to more than 1.655 million cases.

Immigration court shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the increase, but other factors, including a rush of alien adults travelling illegally with children to take advantage of misguided court decisions (mis)interpreting the Flores settlement agreement, drove the problem.

Then came the Biden administration, with its (illegal) quick-release policies for migrants who entered illegally and weren’t expelled under Title 42.

Most were placed into removal proceedings, and by FY 2024, the immigration court backlog had grown to more than 3.88 million cases — a 135 percent increase in just three years.

I’ll note Biden continued that first Trump-era hiring spree, but still, the 735 immigration judges on the bench at the end of FY 2024 faced average dockets of 5,286 cases each.

Keep in mind also that the backlog would have been even worse had the Biden administration not cooked the books by dismissing, terminating, or closing 700,000 pending cases involving facially removable aliens, a move the House Judiciary Committee termed a “quiet amnesty”.

That may have been good on paper, but it was plainly not in the best interests of the American people.

Impact of the Trump II Border Shutdown

Trump returned to office vowing to shut the border down, and assigned two veteran officials — “border czar” Tom Homan and CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott — to accomplish that task.

And by July, Homan, Scott, and thousands of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers attained “operational control” of the Southwest border, as agency encounters dropped 92 percent compared to December.

That decline in illegal entries took some of the heat off the immigration courts, and by the third quarter of FY 2025, the backlog had declined for the first time in 17 years (since FY 2008) as immigration judges completed more than 588,000 cases while receiving just more than 448,000.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”

The immigration courts have been under-resourced for all 33-plus years that I have been involved in this area, but Congress acted in H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) to address that gap.

In section 100054 of the OBBBA, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the DOJ component that administers the immigration courts, received $3.33 billion designated for the hiring of immigration judges and necessary support staff “to address the backlog of petitions, cases, and removals”.

That appropriation, however, came with an inexplicable restriction in paragraph (1)(B): “Effective November 1, 2028, [EOIR] shall be comprised of not more than 800 immigration judges, along with the necessary support staff.”

I say “inexplicable” because nobody can explain why there’s any cap on immigration judges. If anything, Congress should put a floor on hiring EOIR adjudicators, but for now, that limitation is the law.

“Designation of Temporary Immigration Judges”

As noted above, the backlog has declined in the past nine months, but the average immigration judge must still juggle a docket of more than 5,500 cases — a herculean task given that each can complete, at best, only 1,000 cases per year.

In response, EOIR on August 28 published a final rule in the Federal Register captioned “Designation of Temporary Immigration Judges”. As the office explains, under that rule: “the EOIR Director ... with the approval of the Attorney General, may designate or select TIJs, which have the authority of an IJ to adjudicate assigned cases and administer immigration court matters”. (TIJs are not counted toward the inexplicable 800-judge cap in the OBBBA.)

The appointment of TIJs has been permitted by regulation since the Obama administration, but prior to the current rule, the only attorneys eligible were former immigration judges, members of the appellate Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), ALJs — administrative law judges — from DOJ and other agencies, and DOJ attorneys with at least 10 years of immigration law experience.

That latter requirement really didn’t make any sense, given that full-fledged immigration judges only need seven years of post-bar experience — not 10 — and any lawyer could apply and be appointed, not just one with immigration experience.

The thought in 2014 when that earlier provision took effect was that many TIJs would want to become immigration judges.

But as the rule explains: “EOIR’s experience with its retired adjudicators, only a handful of whom have indicated a willingness to return as either TIJs or rehired annuitants with limited workloads since the 2014 [regulation] was promulgated indicates that pool is insufficient to address its TIJ needs”.

Consequently, the August 28 rule drops both the immigration-law experience requirement and expands TIJ-eligibility to attorneys from other departments — not just DOJ.

“Pentagon Authorizes Up to 600 Military Lawyers to Serve as Temporary Immigration Judges”

Which brings me to the September 2 AP article, headlined “Pentagon authorizes up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges”.

The outlet reports: “The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department ‘as soon as practicable,’ and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week.’”

Once on the bench, that assignment would boost the current number of immigration judges by about 22 percent, but don’t expect any of them to start hearing cases before late October.

As the August 28 rule notes, DOJ must first approve any would-be TIJs, and once they’re selected, they’ll “receive the same ‘comprehensive, continuing training and support’” that full-time immigration judges already get.

In my case, that meant a week-long course in immigration law and courtroom demeanor, followed by two weeks of in-court experience supervised by a full-time immigration judge.

Trust me — it was more than enough, and attorneys in my class who came in with no immigration-law experience have gone on to have distinguished careers.

“Makes as Much Sense as Having a Cardiologist Do a Hip Replacement”

Nonetheless, AP quoted a critic who complained Defense Department TIJs would “gut[] due process” and that the plan “makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement”.

Spare me. First, though immigration law experts compare the subject to tax law in its complexity, in most cases it’s straightforward and commonsensical.

Aliens enter illegally or they don’t, overstay nonimmigrant visas or they don’t, are telling you the truth about the horrors they faced back home or the relationship they have with their “spouses”, or they aren’t.

By and large, rules of evidence don’t even come into play in immigration court, and when it comes to bond hearings, multiple layers of hearsay and innuendo are fair game.

And if immigration judges — full-time or temporary — have any questions about the law or the facts, they can tell the parties to brief them. When I was an INS trial attorney, I usually hated such requests, but as an immigration judge I thought they were swell — and immensely helpful.

As for “due process”, immigration judges are first adjudicators, not the last. Every alien can have an immigration court decision reviewed by the BIA, and if they aren’t happy there, can ask the local federal circuit court to weigh in — and both tribunals are more than happy to send a wrongly decided case back or reverse a decision.

Even the cariologist/hip surgeon comparison is inapt.

The doctor’s adage “see one, do one, teach one” was coined by Dr. William Stewart Halsted at Johns Hopkins in the late 19th century when he was training young, would-be surgeons. Under the latest rule, TIJs will see many immigration cases — and likely do many under supervision as well — before the training wheels come off.

Moreover, while it’s true that I wouldn’t grab cardiologists from the cath lab and have them cut on me, immigration law isn’t surgery — and if I thought I was having a heart attack, I’d trust an orthopedist to diagnose my symptoms.

Respectfully, there are plenty of Article III, federal court judges with no experience at the outset in the varied areas of the law they are expected to adjudicate. To the best of my knowledge, no Supreme Court justice in history ever practiced immigration law, but they have the final word in interpreting it.

Finally, as the August 28 Federal Register notice notes, “Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success as an” immigration judge; trust me when I tell you from experience, truer words have never been spoken.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/judge-gavel-warrant-social.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:20.070722

President Trump has been mentioning the effort for weeks as part of his broadening immigration enforcement across the country, which aims to arrest people in cities including Chicago that typically don’t coordinate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Recently, Mr. Trump has described Chicago as a “mess,” the latest volley at a city that he has long criticized for its Democratic leadership and crime rate. He has already sent federal agents and troops to Los Angeles and Washington, and has said the moves are necessary to fight street crime and enforce immigration laws.

An internal document obtained by The New York Times indicated that Department of Homeland Security officials would arrive at the Naval Station Great Lakes this week and that there would be 30 days of operations in the Chicago area. In recent weeks, ICE officials have sought significant resources for the operation, including thousands of handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, as well as a number of gas masks, license plate readers and buses, according to an official with knowledge of the plans.

In Chicago, at least 150,000 people in the city of 2.7 million are undocumented, estimates show, making up about 8 percent of households.

Both political leaders and residents say they are uncertain what exactly is about to take place.

Hundreds of Chicago residents have vowed to gather in protest downtown at the first sign of ICE raids, and metal barricades were placed around the federal courthouse on Thursday night in the heart of the Loop.

In the suburbs north of Chicago on Friday morning, protesters unfurled banners in opposition to ICE along on a highway that leads from a naval station that is being used as a staging ground for the federal government’s operations.

Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said that his administration was ready to fight Mr. Trump in court if the president expanded the operations beyond immigration and ordered National Guard troops to enter the city. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to send troops to Chicago, saying that policing in the city needs federal help. But violent crime has dropped there in the last several years, and city officials said this summer recorded the fewest homicides since 1965.

Chicagoans, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants, have been anxiously monitoring news of the federal involvement. Some say they fear they could be arrested and deported.

“We are all afraid, but we also feel a sense of resignation,” said Francisco, a Mexican man who asked that his full name not be used because he was not authorized to be in the country. He said he had been working in Chicago as a janitor, cleaning offices and stadiums since 2010.

Immigration officials have been under increasing pressure to make more arrests and deport a growing number of people to fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations.

In Illinois, ICE has made at least 1,400 immigration arrests since Mr. Trump took office through the end of July, a much lower rate per capita than in other immigrant-heavy states like New York. More than a thousand of those arrests have been in the Chicago area

The operation in Chicago is expected to be particularly challenging for ICE. ICE officials have found difficulties in the past in progressive communities where advocates have advised people not to answer their doors to immigration officers seeking their arrest. Officials are also on alert for potential protest activity.

The anticipated crackdown coincided with a typically raucous time in the city as celebrations of Mexican Independence Day were to begin on Saturday with a parade in the Little Village neighborhood on the Southwest Side. Most Latinos in Chicago are of Mexican descent, and each year, thousands attend parades, fly Mexican flags from their cars and form caravans, honking horns and causing gridlock around the city.

The holiday was expected to be muted this year because of the prospect of federal law enforcement. Some organizers said they would cancel events altogether. El Grito Chicago, a two-day musical festival set to take place in mid-September in Grant Park, the city’s front yard, was postponed.

“It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake, and that’s a risk we are unwilling to take,” organizers said in a statement.

Chicago Public Schools has also been monitoring the situation with alarm.

Latinos make up nearly half of the city’s public school system’s 325,000 students, and some administrators worry that families will choose to keep their children home out of caution. Most of Chicago’s 800,000 Latino residents are legally in this country, but advocates say they worry that families will still fear being caught up in raids even if they have legal status.

Teachers planned to hold “solidarity walk-ins” on Friday, handing out brochures to parents or passers-by with details on their legal rights, should they be confronted by ICE agents.

In the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday morning, several dozen people showed up at an ICE processing facility in protest.

The group included some holding a prayer vigil and others carrying signs and chanting “all power to the people, no one is illegal.” Some members of the group have been protesting outside the facility weekly for almost two decades

The windows and the front door of the facility, a two-story building on a quiet, industrial street, were recently covered with plywood. Asked about the reason for the plywood, ICE officials did not provide an explanation.

City leaders encouraged protest against what they have described as a military occupation, but urged a peaceful, nonviolent reaction.

Former Representative Luis Gutiérrez, a Democrat, stood in Federal Plaza downtown on Thursday and denounced the Trump administration, while acknowledging that a violent response from the public could spur the president to bring in the National Guard.

“Lift your voice but not your hand,” Mr. Gutiérrez said. “The only one who wins when there is violence is Donald Trump, because he wins by saying that the people of the city of Chicago need the National Guard because it is a city of violence.”

Protests and incidents of arson over ICE arrests in Los Angeles led Mr. Trump to send thousands of National Guard members into the city over the summer.

Support for Mr. Trump’s plans for Chicago has been quiet in the city, relative to the opposition. But some Chicagoans said they would welcome troops to enforce the laws in their neighborhoods.

Wanda Williams, 49, sat on a bench in Federal Plaza on Friday. She said that while she was not in favor of deportations, she would not be upset if Mr. Trump brought in the National Guard to contend with problems other than immigration.

“I say bring them, I’m sick of the crime,” said Ms. Williams, a resident of the Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side, where she said drug sales were common on her block.

On the streets of Pilsen and Little Village — neighborhoods known for sizable Mexican American populations — immigrant residents, some undocumented and others with varying degrees of legal status, said they had closely followed the news of the crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington and feared that Chicago could become the next target. Many had long ago started limiting their outings to banks and grocery stores and not leaving home without first scanning TikTok or Facebook, or “el Feis,” as most called it, for sightings of immigration agents.

One 14-year-old girl waiting for the bus in the Pilsen neighborhood said her undocumented parents, like those of many of her friends, were scared to go outside over the next few days. Rumors of raids were already proliferating online, some complained, putting only more stress on communities already on edge. The National Guard seemed to be on everyone’s mind.

Maricela, 50, who declined to use her full name because she was undocumented, said the constant sense of worry and nervousness could be damaging to peoples’ health.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/NAT-CHICAGO-BRACING-1-qpzw/NAT-CHICAGO-BRACING-1-qpzw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:56:48.492202

Whether detaining a Turkish student on the street in Boston, raiding Home Depot parking lots in Los Angeles or, now, arresting immigrants on the streets of the capital, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in tactical gear and with their faces obscured have become a strange new national pageant.

The Homeland Security Department says that in an era of extreme polarization and rising political violence, masks are necessary. “ICE officers wear a mask because they’ve been doxxed by the thousands,” Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, told my colleagues at “The Daily.” “Their families have been doxxed. ICE officers’ pictures show up on trees and telephone poles. Death threats are sky-high.” Masking, the argument goes, is simply the practical response.

Lawmakers in liberal states say the practice should be banned, and this summer, Democratic elected officials in California, New York and Pennsylvania proposed laws to do just that. At the end of July, Virginia’s Democratic senators introduced a bill to ban the use of masks nationally. The issue also got the attention of a federal judge, who, in a ruling on Tuesday against Mr. Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles, noted disapprovingly that the armed forces’ identity “was often obscured by protective armor.”

As I watched all of this, I found myself wondering about masking by law enforcement and whether it has a history in the United States. Something about it seemed at once familiar and foreign. That’s because I associate the practice with Russia.

In the summer of 2000, when President Vladimir Putin had just taken office, I was living in Moscow and working as a reporter. At the time, the first battle lines were being drawn between the new president and the powerful oligarchs he hoped to tame. Russians began to see raids by government forces on oligarchs and their properties. Men in masks conducted them. They became so ubiquitous that people began referring to them sardonically as Maski Show, or mask shows, after a popular television show involving mask-wearing clowns.

The United States is not Russia. But as I search for ways to understand what is happening in my country today, I am looking to the places I’ve been before. In Russia in the 2000s, I thought of masking as a peculiar feature of a wobbly post-Soviet state. Over time it became clear that it was a harbinger of a new era.

The Power and the Danger

Masks became a feature of America’s fiercely polarized political life during the Covid pandemic. Mask requirements enraged conservatives, who saw them as an effort by the government to boss them around on flimsy science. Concerns about the virus’s spread subsided, but the debate seemed to have unlocked something in the American psyche about the power — and danger — of masks.

Over the past several years, states and counties began passing laws against masking that applied to protesters in demonstrations, reasoning that they would be more likely to do something illegal if law enforcement couldn’t see their faces.

Some of those laws echoed statutes passed in the 1940s and 1950s by states and cities that were trying to control the Ku Klux Klan, said Robert Mickey, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. Even though Klan chapters were often “shot through with members of the police,” Mr. Mickey said, those officers, who showed their faces during the day, wore masks when doing the work of the Klan at night.

There are good reasons vigilantes wear masks and police officers don’t. Policing experts argue that masking by law enforcement is wrong because officers are public servants and are supposed to be accountable to the public. Hiding behind a mask makes that harder. Yes, officers’ jobs can be dangerous, but being publicly identifiable goes along with having the right to wield a deadly weapon on behalf of the state.

In recent years in the United States, trends in law enforcement were moving in the opposite direction. Many police departments now use body cameras and require that the officer’s badge, with name and number, be visible.

Michael German, a retired F.B.I. agent who is now a fellow in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, said that even when he worked undercover, “the period of secrecy ended when charges were brought and I had to defend what I had done in that undercover capacity.”

Masking provides leeway for abuse, he said. People tend to be more scrupulous and vigilant when they can be personally held accountable for their actions. A mask allows more latitude for sloppiness or shortcuts — a punch or a kick, for example.

No one I interviewed could think of an example of American law enforcement masking. Jules Epstein, a law professor at Temple University who worked for decades as a criminal defense lawyer and death penalty litigator, said that in his more than 45 years of practice, he had never seen the police wear masks, including in high-profile gang cases.

‘Without Question a Bad Sign’

Outside the United States, masking by law enforcement has a long history. When it happens, it tends to be in countries with weak central governments, sometimes ones that are fighting insurgencies or drug cartels or, for that matter, political opponents.

In Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s, the government worked with paramilitary groups — forces on the side of the government but not directly employed by it — that often wore masks. They operated at the margins of the law, according to Adam Isacson, a security expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, and over time, courts and special tribunals have documented abuses they perpetrated. In Colombia, the state was up against a well-equipped and deadly foe: drug cartels. Anyone obstructing them had reason to fear for their lives. Judges wore masks to avoid reprisal killings, a practice that became known as “judges without faces.”

Law enforcement officers in Mexico sometimes mask, too, Mr. Isacson said, in areas where drug cartels have a strong presence.

In Peru, government forces often wore masks in their war against Shining Path guerrillas in the 1980s and 1990s, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist who has studied Latin America and written about democratic decline. In areas where Shining Path was strongest, police officers were afraid of reprisals by the guerrillas but also of becoming pariahs in their own communities for abuses they themselves committed, he said.

More recently, Human Rights Watch has documented cases of government forces using masks in Venezuela during the repression that followed the country’s tainted presidential election last year. And in the Philippines, victims of Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal antidrug campaign report that the people doing the killing were sometimes masked.

“The use of masks,” Mr. Levitsky said, “is without question a bad sign.”

And it is extremely rare in functional democracies. “I cannot think of a democratic country with a reliable rule of law where security forces mask themselves,” Mr. Levitsky said. “It just doesn’t happen.”

Stronger, more confident regimes rarely mask. Totalitarian states that have established control over their populations tend to avoid moves that would stir dissent. Masking can draw attention to the fact that the government is up to something it wants to hide, or that it is not powerful enough to protect its own forces. In short, it’s a bad look.

In China, the security forces do not wear masks, said Lynette Ong, a China scholar and professor at the University of Toronto. But something else happens. In her book, “Outsourcing Repression,” Ms. Ong explains that China’s everyday security policing force draws from ordinary people mobilized from the street and paid a daily rate or hired on a contract. The state does not formally employ them, and when they are caught harming someone, the government can plausibly say it was not responsible. China may be authoritarian, she said, but public officials can be held accountable for abuse. They can be fired, for example, if their forces are caught on camera beating people up.

Masks are rare in Iran, too, though they are occasionally used in drug and organized crime operations, said Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist who is now an Iran expert at DAWN, a Washington-based organization focused on U.S. policy in the Middle East. He said that when he was arrested in 2005, no one, not even his interrogators, wore masks.

“The people who interrogated me, they wanted me to see their faces,” Mr. Memarian said.

The reason was that the government wanted to show that what it was doing was legitimate. They also arrested him discreetly, “without a splash,” Mr. Memarian said. A number of armed men came to his building, but his neighbors had no idea it was happening. They kept it low-key so as not to draw the attention of regime critics.

“Once a mask is involved,” he said, “people understand it as a sign of weakness, that the government has something to hide.”

The Show

In Russia in the early 2000s, Mr. Putin wasn’t trying to hide anything. On the contrary: He was putting on a show that he wanted everyone to see. Russia’s central government had been plagued by weakness throughout the 1990s, with the oligarchs running official agencies and having their way with the state. The Maski Shows were efforts by this new leader to turn the tables.

One of the most famous episodes took place a few days after Mr. Putin was inaugurated in May 2000. Armed men in military fatigues and masks showed up at one of the offices that belonged to the oligarch who had founded the first independent television network, NTV.

Yevgeny Kiselyov, then the director of the channel and its main anchor, remembers being struck by the over-the-top nature of the force. “They were carrying out their operation as if this building was full of heavily armed terrorists,” he said in an interview. In reality, it was middle-aged women working in accounting.

The television station was eventually taken over by the state, and Mr. Kiselyov now lives outside Russia. He said the meaning of the raid was clear even then. It was a public message, not just to that station and its owner, but to anyone who opposed Mr. Putin. “It was an act of intimidation,” he said. “It was saying, ‘We are now in power, and we are going after you.’”

The Trump administration seems to be sending the same message with ICE, except in this case, the targets are not oligarchs, but immigrants and the businesses who employ them.

But there are other audiences. Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas, who helped oversee border security in the George W. Bush administration, said he believes the performance is aimed at would-be migrants around the world. Former President Joe Biden, “no matter what he did, could not change the view of the world that the border was open,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “I knew it was going to take someone who was going to create some heartache, and that they’d have to be very tough and create some fear to change the circumstances.”

And then there’s the domestic audience. Polling suggests that many Americans don’t like Mr. Trump’s tactics around deportations, at least when it comes to immigrants who have not committed violent crimes. But some Americans do approve of it, perhaps drawn to its dark spectacle. The immigrant detention center in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is now tied up in court battles, has its own merch. Americans pose for selfies by the center’s new highway sign and post them on social media. In early August, Indiana announced a partnership with the Homeland Security Department to build the “Speedway Slammer,” its answer to Alligator Alcatraz. A few weeks later, Nebraska announced plans for the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Mr. Levitsky called the highly visible, almost ostentatious use of masks “a performance but with real-world consequences.” “MAGA seems to get something out of playing authoritarian,” he said. “There’s an element of cosplay to it.”

Perhaps the most important audience of all is the agency itself — and its potential recruits. ICE says it wants to hire 10,000 new agents at a time when hiring law enforcement officers has been hard. It got a multibillion-dollar cash infusion from Congress in July. Masking could serve to reassure reluctant applicants, who are worried for their safety or about being judged by people they know, but also to attract more exuberant ones, who see masking as subversive and fun.

In August, the Homeland Security Department posted on social media an image in the style of the TV show “South Park” that showed a caravan of cartoon figures riding in ICE cars. Their faces were all covered from the nose down.

The president and his supporters see the influx of agents and soldiers as a means to curb crime and crack down on illegal immigration. Critics say Mr. Trump is using the deployments to punish Democratic-led cities and spread fear in immigrant communities. The move has prompted lawsuits, demonstrations and a scramble among local officials to respond.

Here’s how the federal presence on the streets has unfolded so far in some cities, and here’s how it may soon play out elsewhere.

Chicago

The Trump administration is making plans for escalated arrests of undocumented immigrants, using hundreds of federal agents who are being sent to the Chicago area. They are expected to use a naval base outside of the city as a staging area for operations. Local officials and immigrant advocacy groups are on high alert, reminding residents of their rights and urging caution.

Whether Mr. Trump will send the National Guard into Chicago is murky.

In Washington, D.C., the president deployed the National Guard as part of his security takeover there. But Washington is a federal district and not a state, and governors normally have control of their state Guard troops. Mr. Trump bypassed state control in California, where he federalized National Guard troops and sent them to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom. In Illinois, however, there has been no civil unrest in Chicago that might require National Guard assistance.

For weeks, Illinois officials have loudly objected to the Trump administration’s rumored plans, holding news conferences and rallies to make their position clear: They do not want the military in Chicago.

Mr. Johnson issued an order saying that the city would pursue “all available legal and legislative avenues” to resist actions by the federal government “that violate the rights of the City and its residents, including the Constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest and the right to due process.”

Advocacy groups are making plans to stage protests in opposition to any escalated immigration arrests, or the potential presence of the National Guard.

Los Angeles

Federal immigration agents carried out large-scale immigration raids in the Los Angeles area on June 6, including one at a clothing wholesaler in downtown Los Angeles that led to the arrests of dozens of people.

Since the raids began, more than 5,000 undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The raids have been met with backlash from local leaders and residents. Federal immigration agencies, including the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have said that agents are conducting targeted operations. But videos of many raids taken by bystanders and activists and posted on social media have shown agents chasing down people seemingly at random at Home Depot parking lots, carwashes and other workplaces.

At least two people have died after trying to flee immigration agents in Southern California. One man died in July after falling more than 30 feet from a greenhouse at a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County. In August, another man died after being struck by a vehicle while running onto a freeway near Los Angeles as he was trying to flee agents at a Home Depot.

Protests immediately erupted in Los Angeles on the first day of widespread immigration raids in June. The protests spread from downtown Los Angeles to Compton and across the region.

The protests prompted President Trump to send thousands of National Guard members into Los Angeles. Many of those soldiers have since been withdrawn, but about 300 remain. The deployment has cost taxpayers nearly $120 million so far, Mr. Newsom said.

The raids, protests and military presence have led to several legal battles.

One lawsuit was filed against the federal government over the Guard deployment. Another was filed against the Department of Homeland Security, accusing federal agents of stopping people based on the color of their skin. That lawsuit prompted a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order, barring agents from making indiscriminate stops. The ruling was upheld by an appeals court.

The operations in Los Angeles have been led by Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol chief known for confrontational tactics and aggressive raids. It was unclear if Mr. Bovino would join the immigration crackdown in Chicago, but in a video posted on Tuesday on social media, Mr. Bovino suggested that Border Patrol officers were headed to a new city.

“We’re going to trade these palm trees,” he said, “for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues.”

Washington, D.C.

President Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington in August in an effort to crack down on crime, despite figures that indicated a recent drop in crime rates in the area.

In two weeks, federal agents helped arrest about 1,000 people. A New York Times review of the arrests found that the operation appeared to be more of a dragnet than a targeted effort. In addition to those arrests, agents also arrested more than 400 other people who were believed to be undocumented in a three-week time frame.

New Orleans, Mr. Trump said, is a city in a state with a “a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite tough?”

Mr. Landry, a Republican, welcomed the idea of troops coming to New Orleans. Last year, he helped create a special unit of the Louisiana State Police to focus on public safety in New Orleans. Recent data has shown that New Orleans has recorded a drop in violent crimes this year.

Other Cities

The Trump administration has also suggested sending the National Guard or a surge of immigration agents to other cities, including Baltimore and Boston.

Mr. Trump has said he had an “obligation to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore,” adding that the city is a “very unsafe place.”

The Trump administration has also threatened to send immigration agents to Boston. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the city over its sanctuary policies. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in a statement that Boston was “among the worst sanctuary offenders in America.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/05NAT-CITIES-EXPLAINER-top2-qlch/05NAT-CITIES-EXPLAINER-top2-qlch-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:23.937740

Their work has been instrumental in building genocide cases and pressing for investigations into Israel’s conduct in Gaza and the West Bank.

The sanctions, quietly posted on the Treasury’s website, accuse the organizations of undermining U.S. foreign policy interests, essentially for doing the very work international law demands: documenting atrocities and seeking justice.

These measures come at a time when global pressure is mounting to hold Israel accountable for its military campaign in Gaza, which has left tens of thousands dead, displaced entire communities, and decimated civilian infrastructure.

Rights advocates say the timing is no coincidence. As calls grow louder for war crimes investigations and genocide proceedings, Washington appears to be doubling down on shielding its ally from scrutiny—even if that means punishing those who speak for the victims.

Al-Haq, PCHR, and Al Mezan issued a joint statement condemning the sanctions as politically motivated and legally baseless. “This is not just an attack on our organizations,” they wrote, “it’s an attack on the principle of justice itself.”

The three organizations declared in their joint response, “Only states with complete disregard to international law and our shared humanity can take such heinous measures against human rights orgs working to end a genocide”—a statement that underscores the gravity of the U.S. decision and its implications for global justice.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from international legal experts, who warn that targeting rights defenders for cooperating with the ICC sets a dangerous precedent.

It sends a chilling message to civil society groups worldwide: that documenting war crimes and advocating for accountability may come at a cost.

Enes Hocaogullari, who took part in a March meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, as one of Turkey’s youth delegates, was arrested last month after he criticized the detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and other opposition figures.

The 23-year-old activist also spoke out against alleged police violence during protests that erupted following Imamoglu’s arrest.

Marc Cools, president of a delegation of the Council of Europe’s local and regional authorities congress, said there was no legal justification for Hocaogullari’s prosecution or detention.

“Silencing Enes is silencing youth — and silencing youth is silencing democracy itself,” Cools said after visiting Hocaogullari in prison Friday and meeting a day earlier with Turkey’s deputy justice minister and other officials in Ankara.

Hocaogullari was taken into custody at Ankara’s Esenboga airport in August and later charged with “publicly disseminating misleading information” and “inciting hatred and enmity among the public.”

The first hearing of his trial is scheduled for Sept. 8.

“We hope that justice will prevail, that all charges will be dropped, that he will be immediately released,” Cools said.

Imamoglu, a popular opposition figure seen as the main rival to Erdogan in the presidential elections, was arrested in March over allegations of corruption, which he strongly denies. He was officially nominated as the presidential candidate for the main opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, following his imprisonment.

Several other CHP mayors and municipal employees have also been arrested as part of investigations into alleged corruption. The CHP denies the accusations.

Critics view the arrests as a politically motivated crackdown on the CHP, which made significant gains in local elections last year. The government denies the accusation, asserting that the judiciary operates independently and that the investigations target serious corruption allegations.

Now, as the next Supreme Court Term looms, the VRA is once again at risk.","My time as an Equal Justice Works Fellow at CAC began and ended with Supreme Court cases with major consequences for our multiracial democracy. A few months before I started, voting rights litigators obtained significant victories at the Court that upheld bedrock protections for the right to vote. But threats to voting rights lingered, and two years later, on the last week of my fellowship, CAC filed an amicus brief in the latest challenge to the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and its ability to ensure equal opportunity for voters of color. Much can change in a few years, and I feel exceptionally fortunate that I’ve spent these years at CAC.

Two Supreme Court decisions from June 2023 affected the course of my Fellowship. First, in Moore v. Harper, the Court soundly rejected the so-called independent state legislature theory (ISLT). At the same time, however, the Court created a small potential opening for ISLT proponents, writing that, under the Elections Clause, the Court has the power to review state court decisions on state election law when those courts “transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review.” During the first half of my fellowship, I delved into historical and legal research to combat any future invocations of ISLT and demonstrate that federal court review of state court decisions in this area is only appropriate in extremely rare and unlikely circumstances. This project culminated in an article published in the Boston College Law Review in April 2025 that I co-authored with my colleagues David Gans and Brianne Gorod. As legal scholarship plays a critical role in developing and promoting pro-democracy arguments, I am thrilled that CAC was able to contribute to the important academic discourse on ISLT and support future litigation against the doctrine.

The second case was Allen v. Milligan. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the longstanding legal framework governing Section 2 of the VRA’s protection against vote dilution, which is critical to ensuring that voters of color have an equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. After the Court’s decision in Milligan, several lower court vote dilution cases resumed, and new challenges to the VRA were raised in courts of appeals. I worked on two amicus briefs in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits defending the constitutionality of Section 2 of the VRA and another amicus brief in the Fifth Circuit arguing that Section 2 protects coalitions of voters of color who jointly bring vote dilution claims.

These were not the only voting rights cases that I had the privilege to work on. CAC filed three amicus briefs in litigation challenging state election laws under the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits laws that disenfranchise voters for minor errors in voting paperwork. And in Florida state courts, I worked on briefs defending against efforts to weaken the Florida Constitution’s voting rights protections.

During the last year of my fellowship, however, new threats to democracy emerged, including several actions taken by the Trump Administration to weaken bedrock constitutional rights and principles. And as case after case has been filed to challenge the Trump administration’s lawlessness, CAC has been there defending democracy and the rule of law, and I am grateful to have contributed to the fight as a Fellow. For example, after President Trump purported to curtail birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants, CAC filed several amicus briefs in the Supreme Court and federal courts of appeal on behalf of an ideologically diverse group of scholars of constitutional law and immigration in which we explain that the Fourteenth Amendment means what it says: all children born in the United States are citizens of the United States, and no executive order can change that. I have also worked on amicus briefs CAC has filed in cases challenging the administration’s efforts to unilaterally dismantle executive departments and agencies, including an amicus brief filed on behalf of members of Congress in litigation challenging the administration’s attempt to dismantle the CFPB.

Now, as the next Supreme Court Term looms, the VRA is once again at risk. In Louisiana v. Callais, the Court is considering a challenge to a congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature passed to remedy a Section 2 violation. I worked on the amicus brief CAC filed in the case in December 2024 and wrote a piece in Slate in March 2025 recapping the oral argument. This summer, however, the Court scheduled the case to be reargued this upcoming Term and ordered supplemental briefing on the constitutionality of the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-Black district. During the last week of my fellowship, I worked on another amicus brief that CAC filed in the case, arguing that the drawing of majority-minority districts to remedy vote dilution is consistent with the text and history of the Fifteenth Amendment.

My fellowship started with significant wins for democracy and is ending with a case that could radically undermine the VRA’s ability to protect voters of color and advance the goals of the Fifteenth Amendment. But while the threats to voting rights and democracy may have changed over the past two years, CAC’s steadfast commitment to promoting the progressive promise of the Constitution has not. At the Supreme Court and lower courts, CAC and our brilliant team of attorneys have been there to explain to courts that the Constitution’s sweeping protections for democracy and voting rights cannot be undermined, whether by states seeking to weaken the voting strength of voters of color or a President taking unlawful unilateral executive action. I feel immensely privileged to have been a member of the CAC team over these two years, and I am very grateful for all the opportunities I have had and the lessons I have learned. As I finish my fellowship amidst unprecedented threats to the rule of law and democracy, I am heartened by the fact that CAC will be here to take on these challenges in the months and years to come.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-09-05 14:57:33.270425

This move attempts to criminalize immigrants seeking green cards, naturalized citizenship or those seeking approval under humanitarian programs. Historically, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services operated separately from immigration arrests and enforcing deportations because the agency primarily functions as a naturalization agency.

“Within months, the Trump administration has eroded every avenue for legalized immigration, making the process virtually impossible. Cruelty is the only motivating factor in these current policy decisions,” said Tieffa Harper, deputy legal director, SPLC. “This administration simply does not want immigrants to feel safe and is using any means to make it more difficult to become an American citizen.

“With the hiring of armed agents, the fear of deportations and arrests increasingly becomes an everyday reality for immigrants seeking naturalization services. Under Trump, America is no longer a haven for those seeking hope, prosperity and refuge. The SPLC stands in solidarity with immigrants and our partners fighting on their behalf to demand that the US fulfill the promise of liberty, equality and justice a reality guaranteed by our Constitution.”

Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a September statement that the appellate ruling will permit ""atrocities to happen"" at the Alligator Alcatraz site.
""The Everglades Detention Camp isn’t just an environmental threat; it is also a huge human rights crisis,"" she wrote in a prepeared statement.","An appellate court temporarily allows the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center to remain open.

Gov. Ron DeSantis praised the appellate court's decision, stating the facility is ""open for business.""

Environmental groups challenging the facility have vowed to continue their legal fight.

Gov. Ron DeSantis hailed a Sept. 4 appeals court ruling allowing — for the moment — operations to continue at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center.

""The mission continues on immigration enforcement,"" the governor said in a videotaped statement on social media. ""Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business.""

The order from the11th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, simply allows the state to continue detaining people at the facility until the judicial panel issues a final ruling on the matter.

On Aug. 21, a federal judge agreed with the plaintiffs alleging the state failed to conduct proper environmental assessments and impact studies before opening the facility, and effectively ordered the closing of the detention center.

DeSantis and state officials immediately appealed that ruling.

Plaintiffs: Fight against detention camp and for the Everglades goes on

The groups that challenged the existence of the facility on environmental grounds vowed to continue their legal battle, however, after the latest decision.

In a prepared statement, Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said the ruling imposing a ""limited stay"" on the closure decision is ""disappointing,"" but added that the case is far from being decided.

“We’re hopeful the preliminary injunction will be affirmed when it’s reviewed on its merits during the appeal,” Samples said.

“In the meantime, if the DeSantis and Trump administrations choose to ramp operations back up at the detention center, they will just be throwing good money after bad because this ill-considered facility — which is causing harm to the Everglades — will ultimately be shut down.”

Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, also a plaintiff in the case, said the ruling was ""heartbreaking"" but not a conclusion.

“This is a heartbreaking blow to America’s Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn’t even close to over,” Bennett said in a prepared statement. “The Eleventh Circuit’s order only puts a pause on the district court’s injunction, and we’re confident we will ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility.”

Talbert Cypress, chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, said he was not surprised by the ruling but lauded the dissenting opinion he said steadfastly backed the plaintiffs' position.

“We are disappointed in the majority’s decision to stay the injunction,"" Talbert wrote in a statement. ""We were prepared for this result and will continue to litigate the matter. We find some solace in the dissent’s accurate analysis of the law and will continue to fight for our Mother Everglades.”

Immigration advocates also decry use of Alligator Alcatraz center

The legal battle in federal court is focused on the impact of the facility on sensitive wetlands and wilderness, and potentially on the hydrology that supplies millions of people across South Florida with drinking water.

But the detention camp is also at the center of a bitter debate over the handling of the apprehension, detention and deporting of people in Florida.

The Trump and DeSantis administrations have made the pursuit and removal of people seeking permanent status in the state, as well as those living under temporary protection, a centerpiece public policy issue.

The president has often touted the top priority is public safety by removing foreigners who have committed crimes from U.S. communities, including ""the worst of the worst always first"" as he said when he toured Alligator Alcatraz on July 1. But federal officials have also flatly stated that anyone in the United States without permission is a ""criminal,"" as Madison Sheahan, the Immigration Customs Enforcement deputy director, said in Miramar on May 1.

That position has placed countless of people living and working in the United States at risk of detention and deportation, even though they have otherwise abided by laws, including those who were paroled into the country at the southern border and regularly checked in with authorities while their asylum or status claim was adjudicated through the immigration court system.

Lawyers and advocates for immigrants have decried that feature of the immigration crackdown, as well as the conditions in which people being held in the detention center are suffering.

Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a September statement that the appellate ruling will permit ""atrocities to happen"" at the Alligator Alcatraz site. Bozzetto said the ""thousands of men in tents"" at the location are being held in unsuitable conditions and are being deprived of their human and legal rights.

""The Everglades Detention Camp isn’t just an environmental threat; it is also a huge human rights crisis,"" she wrote in a prepeared statement.

""This is a place where hundreds of our neighbors were illegally held, were made invisible within government systems, and were subjected to inhumane heat and unbearable treatment. The fact that a facility embedded in so much pain is allowed to reopen is absolutely disheartening!""","https://www.palmbeachpost.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/16/NPPP/85692805007-img-7842.jpg?crop=1619,911,x0,y84&width=1619&height=911&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-05 15:58:04.648977

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), enacted in 2000, marked the United States’ first sweeping federal commitment to confront human trafficking. By offering a clear legal definition of both sex and labor trafficking, the TVPA pioneered a comprehensive national strategy encompassing three key priorities: protection for survivors, prosecution of traffickers, and prevention of future exploitation. The law transformed not only criminal sanctions, but also the landscape of support and hope for survivors.

In the late 1990s, human trafficking was increasingly recognized as not only an international atrocity but a domestic one as well. Awareness campaigns, survivor advocacy, and bipartisan congressional leadership converged to push the issue into the public eye. Heather Pagan from South Carolina, who endured 18 years of sex trafficking after meeting an abuser at 14, would later testify to lawmakers: “This label that had been stuck to me my whole life: ‘You’re just an addict… You’re just a prostitute. You’re a criminal.’ Now had just been stripped off me.”. Stories like hers underscored the urgency of a law that could provide survivors with a clear path to justice and support.

The TVPA laid down a legal framework that defined trafficking and introduced the “3 P’s” approach: protection, prosecution, and prevention. Within its original language were transformative tools: T visas, which permit survivors to remain in the U.S. while cooperating with investigations; federal funding for shelters, counseling, legal aid, and job training; enhanced penalties for traffickers; and support for anti-trafficking initiatives abroad. Shyima Hall of California, who was sold into domestic servitude at eight and smuggled to the U.S. at age ten, benefitted directly from these protections. Her rescue, prompted by a neighbor’s report, led to the first federal trafficking prosecution in Orange County. She vividly recalls: “No one, not a single person, ever deserves to have their life, their freedom, stolen.” Hall later became a U.S. citizen, authored Hidden Girl, and now advocates widely for survivors.

Since 2000, the TVPA has been reauthorized multiple times, in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2013, 2018, and most recently in 2022, each time extending protections and expanding coverage to domestic victims, especially minors, with greater emphasis on labor trafficking. Pamela Lynn Hock of Virginia, trafficked from age 13 to nearly 18, reflects the importance of these expansions. “We were children… we believed everything that they told us. When they said, ‘We are going to murder you if you don’t do what we tell you to do,’ we believed them.” Today, Hock serves on the state’s Commission on Human Trafficking Prevention and Survivor Support, ensuring that survivor-led insight shapes trauma-informed policy.

Federal implementation through the Office on Trafficking in Persons provides grants that fund NGOs, shelters, legal clinics, and prevention education programs in schools. Local task forces unite law enforcement, social services, and healthcare workers to identify and assist survivors. Community awareness campaigns help shift public perception and provide survivors with a clear path to report exploitation and access help. Pagan’s work as Survivor Support Director for Lighthouse for Life demonstrates how these systemic supports can enable survivors not only to heal but to lead, guiding others to reclaim their lives and dignity.

Despite progress, advocates highlight persistent gaps. Funding and resources have often favored sex trafficking over labor trafficking. As Jenny Footle, a survivor and activist, notes, “It is incredibly important to have equal representation of both labor and sex trafficking in all levels of programming, including the lived experience you are engaging with. For too long, survivors of labor trafficking have been forced to the margins in the sector, despite the fact that labor trafficking is the most prevalent form of trafficking here in the United States.” Undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ survivors still face barriers in accessing services. Some survivors, particularly those forced into commercial sex, continue to face criminalization rather than support. While survivor leadership is growing, it remains underrepresented in the design and governance of anti-trafficking policy.

The future must center survivors in every way: as leaders in policy, educators in prevention, and decision-makers in service systems. As survivor leader Emily Warfield emphasizes, “Survivors deserve to decide what happens after they escape a trafficking situation, whether or not that’s prosecution. They deserve a seat at the table, and they deserve to feel safe in anti-trafficking spaces.” Advocates press for more balanced funding between labor and sex trafficking and for anti-trafficking efforts to intersect meaningfully with immigration reform, labor rights, racial justice, and mental health. Communities must stay engaged through prevention education, survivor-led programming, and inclusive legislation, building on TVPA’s legacy with integrity and equity.

Since its enactment, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act has transformed how the U.S. defines and responds to trafficking, from legal frameworks to community interventions. Its tools have opened pathways to safety, healing, and justice for survivors. Yet the fight continues. Individuals and communities can contribute by supporting survivor-led organizations, advocating for inclusive policies, educating others, and promoting systems that empower rather than punish survivors. The TVPA didn’t end trafficking, but it made sure survivors could finally be seen, heard, and fought for. The question now is whether we’ll keep fighting.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/35289026265_9acee79bc3_o-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:56:48.965784

“The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought,” Sean Hecker, one of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, said at the time of his arrest.","The Trump administration warned in immigration court on Thursday that if Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s recent attempt to open an asylum case in the United States is successful, government officials will seek to deport him back to El Salvador, according to a copy of the court filing obtained by The New York Times.

The filing indicates the administration is opening another front in its efforts to expel Mr. Abrego Garcia from the United States for a second time — this time back to his homeland, where a court already ruled that he cannot be sent because he could face threats or persecution there.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly maintained that they will not allow Mr. Abrego Garcia to go free in the United States. And last month, after he was released from custody in the separate criminal case he is facing and then quickly rearrested, they originally said they were considering expelling him to Uganda.

But in a filing in immigration court in Baltimore linked to his asylum request, Trump administration officials seriously raised the idea that sending him back to El Salvador was also an option. They said that opening an asylum case would essentially nullify the earlier ruling that he could not be sent back to his home country.

“Should the Immigration Court grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, D.H.S. will pursue the respondent’s removal to El Salvador,” the Trump administration argued in its filing. It said the earlier ruling “will no longer be valid” if the asylum case moves forward.

The asylum request, which was filed in late August, was the latest twist in the legal cases surrounding Mr. Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who was deported in March to a notorious terrorism prison in El Salvador because of an administrative error. That removal, officials eventually acknowledged, violated a court ruling issued in 2019 that had expressly barred his being sent to the country where he feared his life could be in danger.

But since then, he has become a symbol of the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration tactics. U.S. officials insist he will never go free in the United States, while his attorneys accuse the administration of trying to make an example of him, regardless of the rule of law.

In its filing to the immigration court in Baltimore, Trump officials said that they would seek to overturn the decision barring Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador, claiming it was no longer valid.

When Mr. Abrego Garcia obtained that order, he had also applied for asylum. But while the immigration judge who considered his initial application found the asylum request to be “credible,” he pointed out that Mr. Abrego Garcia had not filed within a year of arriving in the United States as required under the law.

Since his arrest by immigration officials on Aug. 25, Mr. Abrego Garcia has been held in a detention center in Virginia. He is fighting the government’s efforts to expel him from the country again on two tracks — through his asylum request and through a separate civil case that would prevent officials from sending him to Uganda, a country to which he has no ties.

“The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought,” Sean Hecker, one of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, said at the time of his arrest.

After his arrest, Homeland Security Department officials maintained that he would be removed from the United States.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement.

The judge hearing the Uganda deportation case, Paula Xinis, has barred the administration from sending Mr. Abrego Garcia anywhere outside the United States for at least the next few months. Judge Xinis intends to hold a hearing on the possible expulsion to Uganda on Oct. 6 and issue a decision no more than 30 days later.

Even as he fights re-deportation, Mr. Abrego Garcia and his lawyers have been fending off the criminal charges that were brought against him in June in the Federal District Court in Nashville. Those charges, filed in coordination with his return from El Salvador, accuse him of having taken part in a conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States from 2016 until this year.

His attorneys deny those charges and say the government brought them only in a vindictive effort to punish him for having mounted a legal challenge against his initial deportation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/05dc-immig-qpct/05dc-immig-qpct-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:56:39.444142

Kennedy and HHS to link Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism - report

Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr plans to announce that use of Kenvue’s popular over-the-counter pain medication - Tylenol – in pregnant women is potentially linked to autism, without including evidence for the claims, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

Kennedy, in a report, will also suggest a medicine derived from folate called folinic acid can be used to treat symptoms of autism in some people, the WSJ reported.

Tylenol, whose active ingredient is acetaminophen, is a widely used pain reliever, including by pregnant women.

The report, expected this month from the US Department of Health and Human Services, is likely to highlight low levels of folate, an important vitamin, and Tylenol taken during pregnancy, as well as other potential causes of autism, the report said.

Both HHS and Kenvue did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

It is not the first time Kenvue or J&J have faced questions about the link between Tylenol and the condition. In 2023, a judge rejected claims the drug causes autism if mothers take it during pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says Tylenol is safe to use in pregnancy, though it recommends pregnant women consult with their doctors before using it, as with all medicines.

Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group formerly headed by Kennedy, has posted several times in recent weeks on social media site X about the potential link between Tylenol and autism.

Georgia to send National Guard troops to Washington

Georgia is about to become the eighth state to send National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to support Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement big foot operation there, as the US capital sues the administration over its actions.

Georgia governor Brian Kemp announced today that he’s sending 316 members of the state’s National Guard to Washington later this month, in the latest indication that Trump’s law enforcement action there will drag on, the Associated Press reports.

The Republican Kemp said he will mobilize the roughly 300 troops in mid-September to take part in Trump’s D.C. operation to relieve soldiers from elsewhere who deployed earlier.

Georgia is proud to stand with the Trump administration in its mission to ensure the security and beauty of our nation’s capital,” Kemp said in a statement.

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his unilateral action to impose federal resources on DC with the stated goal of cracking down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, seven other Republican-led states have sent troops — Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.

The nationwide debate over gerrymandered redistricting has come to Kansas, as the Topeka Capital-Journal wrote on Thursday.

Republicans initiated efforts, on Donald Trump’s urging, to engineer mid-decade redistricting in Texas, to gerrymander district maps and gain an edge in next year’s midterm elections.

In Kansas, Democratic congresswomen Sharice Davids, who sits in the house with three Republicans to represent the state’s four seats in the lower chamber, could be in difficulty if the district map is gerrymandered by the GOP.

Davids spoke out on Friday, saying: “Under pressure from Donald Trump, Kansas state politicians are pushing an unprecedented mid-decade redraw to make the already gerrymandered maps even more extreme – breaking their promises and putting their own political power ahead of Kansans.”

She added: “Their goal is clear: stack the deck in their favor because they know their policies aren’t popular, including their disastrous budget that rips 79,000 Kansans off their health care just to give billionaires massive tax breaks. Voters, not politicians, should choose their representatives. This potential gerrymander is clearly political, threatens our democracy, and deepens division in our country.”

Donald Trump plans to announce executive orders today in the Oval Office, with the theme we know most about so far being an instruction to rename the Department of Defense the “Department of War”.

Trump was initially expected to issue first orders at 2pm ET then more at 4pm ET, but the media has since been informed that a single event at the White House is now due to take place at 4pm ET.

Some context from my colleague Hugo Lowell: The US president is expected to sign an executive order authorizing the rebrand of the Defense Department, the White House said, as part of an attempt to formalize a name change without an act of Congress.

The order will designate “Department of War” as a “secondary title”, an administration official said, as a way to get around the need for congressional approval to formally rename a federal agency.

But the order will instruct the rest of the executive branch to use the “Department of War” name in internal and external communications, and allows the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to use “secretary of war” as his official title.

Summary

Hello, US politics live blog readers, it’s another busy Friday and there is much more to come, so stay with the Guardian for all the relevant news as it happens. Here’s where things stand:

Most of the 475 people arrested in a massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid at a Hyundai factory construction site in southern Georgia are Korean nationals.

The federal Ice raid is being described as the biggest single Department of Homeland Security (DHS, the parent agency of Ice) enforcement operation at one side in the department’s history. The DHS was created after 9/11.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent called for renewed scrutiny of the Federal Reserve, including its power to set interest rates, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to exert control over the US central bank.

Vladimir Putin has said any western troops placed in Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” for Russian strikes, upping the stakes for Kyiv as Donald Trump’s efforts to forge a peace deal show little sign that are any closer to success.

Donald Trump is sending 10 F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean region. The action to send jets to be based in the US territory follows a deadly US missile strike on Tuesday on a boat that the administration insisted was carrying 11 Venezuelan drug traffickers.

US jobs report. Our sister live blog run by the business team in London has closed now, so here’s our story on the big economics news of the day, that the US added just 22,000 jobs in August, continuing the slowdown amid Trump tariffs.

Reuters notes that the arrests could exacerbate tensions between Washington and Seoul, a key ally and investor in the US, as the countries remain at odds over the details of a trade deal that includes $350bn of investments.

Just last month, South Korea pledged $150bn in US investments – including $26bn from Hyundai Motor – at a summit for the nations’ leaders.

Most of 475 people arrested at Hyundai facility are Korean nationals

The arrested workers were being held at Ice’s Folkston detention facility in Georgia, Schrank said. Most of the 475 people are Korean nationals, he said.

Local Korean media said roughly 300 people detained were South Korean nationals.

“It is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Co. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate,” a Hyundai spokesperson said in a statement provided to Reuters.

Homeland security officials said the workers it arrested at the Hyundai facility in Georgia were barred from working in the US after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas.

The investigation took place over several months, Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of investigations for Georgia, said during a press briefing.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said in comments reported by Reuters.

Schrank said there was a network of subcontractors on the site.

A spokesperson at Hyundai’s battery joint venture partner, South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solutions, said in a statement it was cooperating and had paused construction work.

The facility, a joint venture between LGES and Hyundai Motor, was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES.

Treasury secretary Bessent calls for 'entire' review of Fed

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent earlier called for renewed scrutiny of the Federal Reserve, including its power to set interest rates, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to exert control over the US central bank, whose insulation from short-term political pressures is widely seen as key to its effectiveness.

“There must also be an honest, independent, nonpartisan review of the entire institution, including monetary policy, regulation, communications, staffing and research,” Bessent wrote in the Wall Street Journal.

He called for the Fed to leave bank supervision to other governmental authorities and to “scale back the distortions it causes in the economy”, including by bond purchases made outside of true crisis conditions.

Ice executed search warrant at Hyundai facility over employment practices, DHS says

A US homeland security department spokesperson had earlier said that US immigration authorities executed a judicial search warrant at the Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday over unlawful employment practices and other alleged federal crimes.

The spokesperson said in a statement provided to Reuters that Ice’s investigative arm executed the warrant as part of acriminal investigation.

“This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation,” the spokesperson said.

Trump administration will enforce foreign worker laws, White House says after Hyundai raid

Following on from my last post, the White House said today that the Trump administration will enforce laws that require foreign workers have proper authorization to be in the United States, after immigration authorities raided a Hyundai facility in Georgia.

“Any foreign workers brought in for specific projects must enter the United States legally and with proper work authorizations,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, quoted by Reuters.

“President Trump will continue delivering on his promise to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

475 arrested at Georgia Hyundai site in biggest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations history

A multi-agency immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant site in Georgia led to the apprehension of 475 people, a Homeland Security Investigations official said Friday.The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia.

He said some had overstayed their visas.The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported.

Councilmember Bob Kettle, a military veteran and chair of the Public Safety Committee, said the city is working to address crime without help from Washington, D.C.

""We're up to 24 pieces of legislation."" Kettle said. ""The real time crime center, the CCTV, also the automatic license plate readers, they help system. This is making a difference for our city.""

Kettle, who criticized the Trump administration’s militarization of the National Guard in Los Angeles this summer — a move a judge struck down this week — called the federal tactics “junior varsity” compared to Seattle police.

“No face mask, no face coverings. They have to announce who they are … They don’t come in all dressed tactical, dressed with face coverings. That’s not law enforcement,” he said.

Council President Sara Nelson also criticized federal actions, saying they undermine Seattle’s approach to building trust in policing.

“Not on our watch will ICE agents undermine our efforts to ensure everyone in every community across our city feels safe,” she said in a statement this week.

RELATED: ICE arrests dip in July but remain high in Washington

Advocates with the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network (WAISN) say they’ve tracked ICE arrests at hotspots such as 3rd Avenue and Pike Street in downtown Seattle, often involving agents in unmarked cars. They warn the activity is creating fear that keeps immigrants from working in both urban and rural communities.

“It’s terrible because we can’t do anything without them trying to do something,” said Naomi Bailey, a White Center coffee stall manager who said she feared for her freedom after witnessing an ICE arrest in a drive-through in July. “I mean, I almost got arrested just yelling at them.”

Kettle argued federal agencies should instead focus on cutting off the flow of drugs and weapons into the city along the I-5 corridor.

On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.”

Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand.

“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said.

And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others.

Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.

“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”

Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next.

“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.

“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.”

Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property.

“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.”

But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”",https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Adobe-Town-2-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:27.738301

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 294 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 29 through Sept. 4.

Among the new cases, four people were charged in El Paso for their roles in a scheme to smuggle children from Mexico into the United States, sometimes using candy laced with THC to sedate them during smuggling events. Mexican nationals Susana Guadian and Daniel Guadian; U.S. citizen Dianne Guadian; and Manuel Valenzuela, a lawful permanent resident residing in El Paso, were charged with conspiracy to transport aliens and bringing aliens to the United States for financial gain. According to the complaint, between on or about May 1 through Oct. 17, 2024, the defendants were part of an alien smuggling organization (ASO) that brought unaccompanied alien children between the ages of five and 13 illegally into the United States from Juarez, Mexico. The complaint alleges that Susana Guadian and Daniel Guadian recruited drivers to transport the children by car from Mexico to a port of entry at the U.S. border. The drivers and their co-conspirator would then present U.S. documents to inspecting officers falsely claiming the documents belonged to the children, and that they were the parents of the children. During at least one smuggling event, the alien children were given gummy candies containing marijuana to sedate them. One of the children was taken to a local hospital and later diagnosed with marijuana poisoning. Once inside the United States, the children were then transported to El Paso, where, according to the complaint, Dianne Guadian and Manuel Valenzuela would pick up the children and provide payment to the drivers. The drivers were paid $900 for each minor that they brought into the United States.

U.S. Border Patrol agents in Alpine arrested a Mexican national for being an illegal alien present in the United States. Ever Ortega-Uranga was previously removed for the second time in July 2021. Ortega-Uranga has multiple felony convictions, having been sentenced in Midland to two years confinement for cocaine possession in 2010, followed by three years for public order crimes in 2016. He was also sentenced in 2018 to 46 months confinement in Spring for illegal re-entry.

Otoniel Lopez-Tellez, a Mexican national, was taken into ICE custody in Williamson County, where he was serving a 40-day jail sentence for assault causing bodily injury to a family member. Lopez-Tellez has been removed from the U.S. twice, the last being in 2018, in addition to four voluntary returns.

Mexican national Juan Eduardo Villanueva-Mancilla was taken into ICE custody in Bastrop County, where he was serving a 180-day jail sentence for evading arrest with a vehicle. Villanueva-Mancilla has been removed from the U.S. twice, most recently in April 2023.

Angel Eduardo Moreno-De La Rosa was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents near Normandy on Aug. 27. The Mexican national was allegedly guiding two Pakistani illegal aliens to a pick-up location, where the two Pakistanis would then be transported to San Antonio. According to a criminal complaint, Moreno-De La Rosa claimed he would be paid $1,000 for his role, while the Pakistanis alleged that they paid around $30,000 each to be smuggled further into the U.S.

Mexican national Emanuel Ruiz-Alcantara was arrested near Maverick on Aug. 29 and charged with illegal re-entry after being previously removed to Mexico on Jan. 7. In August 2023, Ruiz-Alcantara was convicted for a smuggling of persons felony in Gonzalez, for which he was sentenced to two years in jail.

Cristian Jiovanni Chavez-Sanchez, also a Mexican national, was charged with illegal re-entry after he was arrested near Maverick on Aug. 26. Chavez-Sanchez has been twice deported, most recently in January through San Ysidro, California. In 2024, he was convicted of four misdemeanors in Utah, including a DUI, marijuana possession, and two weapon offenses.

Honduran national Brayan Alexander Villanueva was arrested near Val Verde on Aug. 30 and charged with illegal re-entry. Villanueva was just removed to Honduras through El Paso on June 28, after being convicted and sentenced in March to two years confinement for possession of a controlled substance. Villanueva was also convicted in 2022 for burglary of a vehicle in Georgetown.

Also in the Del Rio Sector, four Indian nationals—Vikash Vikash, Mehakpreet Singh, Aditya Sharma, and Harsh Singh—were each detained in separate incidents and charged with improper entry after they allegedly crossed the Rio Grande River into the U.S. near Eagle Pass between Aug. 28 and Aug. 30.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States.","Federal and immigration agents arrested 475 people while executing a judicial search warrant at a Hyundai facility in Georgia as part of a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.

Everyone arrested, most of them South Korean nationals, were ""illegally present in the United States or in violation of their presence in the United States, working unlawfully,"" Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, said at a news conference Friday morning.

It was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, Schrank said, adding it “underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans.""

A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building a battery plant next to their manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.

Videos on social media showed agents lining up hundreds of workers at the construction site. Schrank said they questioned everyone about their immigration status, reviewing their documents and conducting background checks.

""This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses. This has been a multimonth criminal investigation,"" Schranck said.

No criminal charges in connection to the investigation had been filed as of Friday.

On Friday afternoon, a judge in the Southern District Court of Georgia unsealed the 15-page search warrant allowing federal agents to go into “the lithium battery cell manufacturing plant” on the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America campus “that is currently under construction.”

The warrant authorized federal agents to seize employment records and immigration documents as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site.

According to the warrant, authorities were also looking for four individuals, but the reasons why the federal government was specifically interested in them remains under seal.

U.S. Attorney Margaret E. Heap said in a statement that more than 400 agents participated in the massive enforcement action, which is part of the broader nationwide initiative “Operation Take Back America,” described as an effort “to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations.”

The South Korean government responded to the detentions of many of their nationals in a statement Friday.

“In the course of U.S. law enforcement, the economic activities of our investment firms and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed upon,"" said Lee Jae-woong, a spokesperson for South Korea's foreign ministry. ""We conveyed our concern and regret to the U.S. Embassy today and urged them to take special care to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our nationals are not violated.”

Jae-woong added that an on-site task force will be established in Georgia with the help of the South Korean consulate in Atlanta.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News that President Donald Trump remains committed ""to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

“The United States is proud to be a home for major investments and looks forward to continuing to build on these historic investments and partnerships that President Trump has secured,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""Any foreign workers brought in for specific projects must enter the United States legally and with proper work authorizations.""

A Hyundai spokesperson told NBC News in a statement Friday that the company is ""closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.""

""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate,” the statement reads.

An LG Energy Solution spokesperson also said in a statement that they “are closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.""

""Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,” the statement reads.

According to Schrank, the workers arrested at the construction site were employed by a network of various contractors and subcontractors, which investigators are looking into.

They all remain in ICE custody after most were brought to the Folkston immigration processing center in Georgia following their arrests, Shrank said.

South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States. In July, Seoul pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment in an effort to lower Trump’s threatened tariffs on its products, which he ended up setting at 15%.

In March, Hyundai said it would invest $21 billion in U.S. onshoring from 2025 to 2028, a number it said last month had increased to $26 billion.

It said the initiatives involved in the investment — including a new $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana, expanded U.S. auto production capacity and a state-of-the-art robotics facility — were expected to create about 25,000 direct jobs in the U.S. over the next four years.

Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Georgia, where the raided construction site stands, is one of the largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites in the state.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have said that the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,400 people, is the largest economic development project in the state’s history.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250905-Hyundai-atf-raid-2-se-1056-7a0c39.jpg",N,,2025-09-05 16:57:13.120164

UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.” “For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk.
Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.
“The Trump administration’s decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns.
“This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”","The U.S. State Department is facing heavy criticism after it announced on Thursday it is imposing sanctions on three major Palestinian human rights groups over their participation in the International Criminal Court’s case (ICC) against top Israeli officials.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he’s adding Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) to the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,” as part of President Donald Trump’s executive order sanctioning the ICC.

The three groups are leading human rights organizations in the occupied Palestinian territories, operating out of the West Bank and Gaza. They have been instrumental in monitoring Israel’s genocide in Gaza and annexation of the West Bank, serving as a key voice of Palestinians amid Israel’s assaults. Sanctions could have a vast chilling effect on their work.

“These entities have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent,” Rubio said. “We oppose the ICC’s politicized agenda, overreach, and disregard for the sovereignty of the United States and that of our allies.”

The groups decried the sanctions in a joint statement calling on states to pressure the U.S. to lift the sanctions. They noted that this is part of a longtime effort by Israel to silence Palestinian voices, by law or by force.

“Threatened by the impact and role of our advocacy, legal research, and documentation in exposing Israel’s ongoing international crimes, the United States has resorted to punishing individuals and organisations seeking to uphold the legal system upon which the international community was founded,” the groups said.

“The implications go beyond Palestine: by protecting Israel from accountability, they are dismantling the international legal order and undermining the possibility of justice for victims of grave crimes anywhere,” the groups went on. “But we will not give up nor be silenced. We will not bend to any State apparatus or system fuelled by violence and oppression.”

The sanctions come after the U.S. sanctioned another Palestinian human rights group, Addameer, which focuses on Palestinian prisoners’ rights, and UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese.

Rubio’s announcement was widely condemned. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.”

“For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk. “The work of civil society in documenting violations and engaging with international accountability mechanisms is all the more important when international humanitarian and human rights laws are being violated systematically in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.”

A coalition of Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, including major organizations like B’Tselem, called the sanctions “violent.”

“This is yet another move aimed at erasing fundamental norms of protecting human beings, designed to enable Israel to continue harming Palestinians without restraint,” the coalition said.

Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration’s decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns. “This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025_09-05-marco-rubio.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:57:01.379000

Following the coup, the National Provisioning Ruling Council struggled to control Sierra Leone against invasion from the Revolutionary United Front, and news of coup plots spread across the capital of Freetown. On Dec. 29, 1992, the National Provisioning Ruling Council extrajudicially killed approximately 29 victims, including former government officials and others accused of planning a coup against the regime. Victims who were not already detained in prison were arrested; several were tortured, and all were summarily executed and their bodies buried in a mass grave.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has initiated a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, acting on his campaign promise to enact the largest mass deportation of such persons in U.S. history.

Immigrants in the country with both legal and illegal residency have been caught up in the crackdown, raising concerns about the scope and impact of the initiative.

Such impacts include several negative effects on the economy, such as the overall monetary and labor cost of the deportation, with documented and undocumented immigrants making up around 20 percent of the U.S. workforce at the start of the year. That number has dropped to 19 percent by June, representing a decline of more than 750,000 workers, according to the Pew Research Center.

What To Know

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Atlanta office participated in the raid, which included Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Georgia State Patrol (GSP), and other partner agencies.

Troopers blocked the roads leading to the Hyundai site, and operations at the plant continued without interruption, according to CBS News.

In an emailed statement to Newsweek, a Hyundai spokesperson said, ""We are aware of the recent incident at the HL-GA Battery Company construction site in Bryan County, Georgia.""

""We are closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.""

The company has made significant investments in the U.S. in recent years, including in Georgia, where it is building facilities related to electric vehicle and battery production.

Hyundai Motor Group started producing EVs a year ago at its $7.6 billion plant, which employs roughly 1,200 workers.

What People Are Saying

A Department of Homeland Security official told Newsweek: ""ICE Homeland Security Investigations, in coordination with our law enforcement partners, executed a judicial search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.

""This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation,"" the spokesperson said. ""This investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for those who violate the law and upholding the rule of law.

""Complex cases like this require strong collaboration and extensive investigative efforts, and we extend our gratitude to the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, FBI, DEA, Customs and Border Protection, ATF, IRS, and the Georgia State Patrol for their invaluable support,"" the spokesperson added.

ATF Atlanta wrote on X: ""Today, [ATF Atlanta] joined HSI, FBI, DEA, ICE, GSP and other agencies in a major immigration enforcement operation at the Hyundai mega site battery plant in Bryan County, GA, leading to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.""

""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades.","Protesters Friday morning will gather outside an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview, calling for its closure after the village said it would be used as a processing center for a ""large-scale"" immigration enforcement campaign led by the Trump administration.

The protest, from groups citing the Illinois Way Forward Act, are expected to gather as early as 7 a.m. Days earlier, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village's roughly 8,000 residents that federal officials said the two-story building, at 1930 Beach St., will be used for the operation for approximately 45 days.

The letter also warned residents that protests and demonstrations near the building, ""like those seen earlier this year in Los Angeles, where property damage and assaults against law enforcement were reported,"" could occur.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,"" village administrator LeTisa Jones told the Associated Press. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

As of 7:15 a.m., several protesters had begun to gather in front of the center, with more arriving as the morning went on, some with signs, and a small police presence.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

Local

Immigration attorneys have previously told NBC Chicago that during the last round of scaled up ICE enforcement, it was difficult to make contact with their clients at the facility.

ICE stationed in Lake County

According to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, increased ICE enforcement in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs could begin as early as this weekend.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago.""

At least 300 federal agents expected to come to the Great Lakes Naval Base in North Chicago as part of the Trump Administration's enhanced operations from ICE, Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said.

A joint statement from the Lake County Government and the City of North Chicago Wednesday called the planned federal operations at the Naval Station ""unprecedented.""

""If the agents are stationed here in Lake County and they say they're going to be in Chicago, who's to say they won't come in to our community?,"" Rockingham Jr. said, who added that the community is approximately 40 percent Latino.

During his Tuesday press conference, Pritzker also said he was ""deeply concerned"" that ICE will target Mexican Independence Day.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

In Chicago, organizers with El Grito, a popular Mexican Independence Day event slated for Sept. 13 and 14 in Grant Park, moved to cancel the festival due to the concerns.

""This was a painful decision; however, with the heightened political tensions and given our location in downtown Chicago, we need to keep our community safe,"" organizer German Gonzalez said in a statement Thursday. ""To proceed in spite of the advice we've received directly from city and state officials and potentially expose our community to becoming collateral damage would be irresponsible. That's a risk we are not willing to take.""

A similar festival in Waukegan was also postponed until November over fears of the increased ICE presence.

Pritzker said agents could be fully assembled by Friday, with operations beginning Saturday, though his office hasn't received official communication from the White House.

Last week, a report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

Mayor Rockingham said the agents will not be staying at the base, and will be housed at hotels in Lake County.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/Image-from-iOS-11.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:44.433524

At the same time, a major federal immigration operation involving officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is also expected to begin in the city.

Last Sunday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, claimed the Trump administration had not informed him of the deployment plans, and that such a move would amount to an “invasion” of the state.

On Saturday last week, Chicago’s Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing Chicago police not to collaborate with National Guard troops or federal agents. The order also urged federal agents to wear body cameras and reveal their faces rather than wear masks, as they have done during previous, “military-style” immigration raids under Trump.

Trump deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles in June, and in Washington, DC, in August, purportedly to fight surging crime rates, but residents and state officials have complained that such moves are undemocratic and say that over-policing will erase trust between local police and communities.

What is the National Guard?

The National Guard is a state-based reserve force totalling 430,040 soldiers and airmen who are serving part-time, rather than full-time. It includes the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard units. National Guard members often hold a civilian job in addition to their military duties.

Each US state and entity has its own National Guard unit, and all together make up the US National Guard. The Guard can be activated for federal missions, such as under Trump’s recent directives, meaning it is dually-controlled by states and the federal government.

The National Guard’s origins go back to colonial-era militias that formed during British rule, with the first colony-wide militia forming in Massachusetts in 1636. Those militias later evolved into an organised, national structure following US independence.

What happened in Los Angeles?

In June, Trump deployed nearly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 US Marines to Los Angeles to quell public protests against ICE raids. California Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as “political theatre”.

A court ruled on Tuesday that the deployment was illegal. It was the first time since 1965 that a president had federalised National Guard troops to address unrest in a state without a governor’s permission. President Lyndon B Johnson, at the time, sent troops to Selma, Alabama, to protect civil rights protesters from violence.

What happened in Washington, DC?

On August 12, Trump announced at a White House press conference that he was temporarily taking control of Washington, DC’s Metropolitan Police Department under Section 740 of the rarely invoked District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows federal control of police during an emergency.

Government officials said the DC force would be in place till November, according to a report on Thursday from ABC News.

Trump additionally deployed 800 National Guard troops to the city to “rescue” it from what he said was a crime and homelessness surge.

“I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said in his announcement. “This is Liberation Day in DC, and we’re going to take our capital back.”

Trump has also said that his administration will seek the death penalty for murder cases in the city.

Washington, DC, is classified as a unique federal district and is a Democratic stronghold. As US president, Trump has direct control over the District of Columbia National Guard and can use the DC police force for 48 hours, or up to 30 days if he notifies Congress. However, Congress has not been formally notified of the recent moves.

DC Mayor Muriel Bowser initially criticised the deployment, describing it as “unsettling and unprecedented” on August 11. She added that although violent crime had spiked in the city in 2023, recent data shows crime rates have been falling and that violent crime is at a 30-year low.

Bowser has since tried to cooperate with federal agents by setting up an operations centre to coordinate communications between federal agencies and local law enforcement. The centre was established under Bowser’s “Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center” (SBEOC), which is a play on Trump’s lingo.

One of the centre’s tasks is to ensure federal agents maintain policing practices that instil confidence in residents, such as not wearing masks, identifying their agencies and providing identification when interacting with people.

Despite that, on August 27, Bowser told reporters that there was a “break in trust” between communities and the police due to the presence of federal agents who wore masks and were not always identifiable. Bowser said she was “devastated” because some residents in the city said they were living in fear.

Why does Trump say it is necessary to deploy troops to cities?

Trump has argued that it is essential to combat crime in Los Angeles, DC and other cities. Despite widespread criticism and legal challenges, he has defended his decision, saying some troublemakers have to be handled by soldiers.

“Frankly, they were born to be criminals,” Trump said on Wednesday, when he confirmed the Chicago deployment would happen but did not give dates. “And they’re tough and mean, and they’ll cut your throat, and they won’t even think about it the next day. They won’t even remember that they did it. And we’re not going to have those people.”

The president has also pointed to what he says are the positive results from the DC federal takeover. Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Trump said the city was now safe and that restaurants were enjoying booming businesses.

“We have no crime,” Trump said. “You’re not going to be shot.”

Republican lawmakers have backed Trump’s actions, especially in DC, where some are proposing a “Make Our Streets Safe Again Act” to target crime and address homelessness.

“President Trump’s unyielding leadership and strength, coupled with proper congressional oversight, ensures that Washington, DC, will reclaim its rightful place,” US Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican, said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Where else has Trump threatened to deploy the National Guard?

Trump and officials from his administration have floated possible plans to deploy the National Guard in Democratic-led cities including Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and New York.

On Tuesday, Trump stated at a conference that he has “an obligation to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore”.

On August 22, he told reporters in the Oval Office that “Chicago is a mess”, and that his administration “will help with New York”.

The day before, ICE’s acting director said agents would “flood” Boston to remove immigrants in the so-called “sanctuary city”, referring to municipalities that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement on immigration issues.

Officials in Baltimore and Chicago, meanwhile, insist that crime rates have fallen in their cities.

In July, Baltimore’s police department said there had been a significant drop in gun violence compared to last year. The city’s Mayor Brandon Scott also told reporters on Monday that by September 1, 2025, 91 homicides and 218 non-fatal shootings were recorded. He said it was the lowest yearly homicide rate in over 50 years.

Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a conference that overall crime rates had fallen in the city by 21 percent. “We will not have our police officers, who are working hard every single day to drive down crime, deputise to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” he said.

How bad is crime in Chicago?

With a population of 2.7 million, Chicago has long had a national reputation linked with high crime rates, particularly gun violence. Legal experts say that reputation has some basis, but that crime rates are not unconnected to the era of racial segregation.

In reality, however, crime rates in Chicago vary depending on the crime type, and generally mirror those in other major cities, according to analysis by CBS News, which cited data from the Chicago Police and the FBI.

Last year, the city had 18,327 reported cases of violent crime, which translates to 695 per 100,000 people. In comparison, Oakland had 1,925 cases per 100,000; Detroit, 1,781; Little Rock, 1,672; and Baltimore, 1,606. Houston, which has a smaller population of 2.3 million, recorded a total of 26,628 violent crimes or 1,148 crimes per 100,000.

According to data from the DC-based Council on Criminal Justice (CJC), Chicago did see a 369 percent [nearly fivefold] increase in violent crime, property and drug offences between 2019 and 2023, driven mainly by a surge in vehicle thefts that was recorded in several other large cities in the same period. Many US cities similarly recorded high crime rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More recently, the CCJ reported that overall crime in Chicago by June 2025 was down compared to 2024.

In a year-on-year analysis, the CCJ noted that violent crimes such as homicides had reduced by 33 percent compared to last year. Aggravated assaults fell by 16 percent, gun assaults by 27 percent, robberies by 35 percent, carjacking by 51 percent and domestic violence by 10 percent.

An exception to the downward trend was sexual assault cases, which only reduced by one percent between June 2024 and June 2025.

What do critics of Trump’s hardline approach say?

Trump’s deployment of troops in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and the looming Chicago deployment have faced criticism and legal challenges from law experts, officials and residents. Some say it constitutes the formation of a “police state”, the sidelining of state authorities, and overreach. Others say it is over-policing that could have an adverse impact on relations between communities and local law enforcement.

“This is an active military takeover of the capital,” protesters who assembled outside Congress in DC on Thursday wrote in an open letter to lawmakers, which they handed out.

“It is a textbook indicator of backsliding democracy and intensifying authoritarianism … This might come off as alarmist, but in the last 100 years of history, the pattern is clear and we are witnessing it in real time,” the letter stated.

California Governor Gavin Newsom and the state’s Attorney General Rob Bonta have also argued that Trump’s decision to deploy federal military agents violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement.

This week, US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the Los Angeles deployment was unprecedented, an overstep of presidential authority, and ultimately, illegal. The case had been filed in June by the state of California.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” Breyer wrote, referring to Trump’s insistence that the anti-immigration-raid protests constituted a “rebellion” that needed to be quashed.

“Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law,” Breyer wrote in his judgement.

“Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act willfully,” Breyer wrote of the Trump administration, adding that the troops deployed failed to adhere to their training materials by carrying out 12 functions that the military is barred from, such as making arrests, carrying out searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, and riot control.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/afp_68b36cb776b3-1756589239.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:26.734962

""They are insulting the service and the honor and integrity with which my husband has served this country and broken his body in that service,"" said Melissa Chaudhry, wife of Zahid Chaudhry.

She says DHS' latest press release reads ""like a political hit job"" and is a ""smear campaign"" against her husband who was at an appointment to get U.S. citizenship when he was detained by ICE.

She says as her husband's 9th circuit appeals moves through the court system, his children cry for him as he remains locked up at the Northwest Ice Processing Center in Tacoma.

""[Zahid] is sick. He is deprived of medication for his thyroid, for the burning in his chest that keeps him up day and night,"" said Melissa. ""He's kept in conditions that qualify as animal abuse if they were inflicted on pets.""

The Council on American-Islamic Relations - Washington (CAIR - WA) released this statement to FOX 13 Seattle:

""We’ve seen a pattern of DHS under this administration engaging in smear tactics to high profile detainees, in order to shore up public opinion to back up their aggressive decisions. There is no need for the Department of Homeland Security to target Mr. Chaudhry’s personal life, especially while he is detained and separated from his family. Every person deserves dignity.""

Micaela Romero, a Digital Organizer and Communication Associate with the Washington Community Action Network (WACAN) sent this statement in response to DHS' press release:

""I am appalled and disgusted by this baseless ""rebuttal"" to our community’s unrest, heartache, and attacks on our family members and loved ones. We’ve known Zahid as a member of WashingtonCAN for over 10 years, and in that time, and since his detainment, we have encountered hundreds of individuals with stories of how Zahid has impacted their lives and been a public servant to their communities. As we continue to show up in our other issue areas, people recognize us as being the organization fighting to bring their loved one and community member, Muhammad ""Zahid"" Chaudhry, home.

""It is on the duty of this administration to do a far better job than they’ve done to prove that Zahid Chaudhry is a worst fraudster and criminal than the Commander in Chief that sits at the helm of these cruel decisions tearing apart families. The community is tired of these deceptive attack on immigrants to silence the tangible gaps left when ICE abducts fathers from their children.""

Melissa is urging supporters to reach out to elected leaders about her husband Zahid.

The apportionment data the Administration tried to illegally hide, and was ultimately forced to divulge, reinforces that the Trump Administration acted with the intention of illegally delaying and restricting funds lawfully provided by Congress.","The recent release of 1,800 internal budget documents shows just how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to illegally withhold or restrict funding. The documents detail how the Trump Administration has abused its authority by adding new layers of political interference and control over agency spending to impose its policy priorities and preferences, even when doing so conflicts with the law.

Until a court intervened, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had been illegally hiding agency “apportionments” — a crucial aspect of financial management whereby OMB grants agencies access to the funds appropriated in statute — actively and intentionally frustrating Congress’s ability to provide oversight over the Administration’s compliance with spending laws. Yet an apportionment is meant to be a routine plan for agencies’ use of funding intended to ensure that the federal government does not violate the restrictions on spending established in law.

Though delaying the spending of lawfully provided funds for policy reasons is illegal, the Trump Administration has seemingly sought to do so through three tactics. First, it is delaying apportionment approvals well past when they are required by law, or withholding them altogether. Second, it is establishing further conditions for an agency’s actual receipt of funds that are hidden from public view. Third, it is designating significant funding amounts as “unallocated” — apparently making it unavailable for agency use for the purposes Congress outlined in law, pending some later agreement between OMB and the agency. In each instance, it is creating an opportunity for abuse that the public disclosure of apportionments was meant to prevent.

Congress gave OMB the power to apportion funds for good reasons: to ensure that spending laws are faithfully followed and that agencies do not overspend the resources available to them and prematurely run out of funding. Congress voted on a bipartisan basis to require these apportionments be made public after President Trump used the apportionment process to illegally withhold military assistance intended for Ukraine during his first term.

With the documents’ recent release, we do not yet know the depth to which the Trump Administration abused the apportionment process, or the full scope of the effects on programs — and people. But what we have seen is more troubling evidence of its efforts to illegally “impound” — not spend — the funds Congress provided.

To take just one example, the Administration leveraged its apportionment power in its effort to illegally withhold billions of dollars in National Institutes of Health (NIH) support for medical breakthroughs and treatments in cancer, diabetes, and other critical health research fields (see “Apportionment as a Tool of Impoundment: NIH as a Case Study” below).

Similarly, it abused its apportionment power to illegally freeze Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support for public health programs until late into the fiscal year, when the funds would be at risk of going unused. With these types of abuses, the Trump Administration has ignored Congress and the law to undermine critical programs that people count on.

Delaying Apportionment Approvals

The Trump Administration is waiting longer than in past administrations to apportion funds for certain programs to delay obligations. Although apportionment plans must be approved within 30 days of enactment of appropriations, OMB consistently provided approvals much later in 2025. For instance, in 2024 OMB approved over 100 apportionments for Department of Health and Human Service accounts in the 30 days following the enactment of full-year appropriations, compared with fewer than ten over the same period in 2025.

The Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund, designed to generate economic growth and opportunity in some of the nation's most distressed communities, has faced an enormous delay in gaining access to the funds provided by Congress in March. The Trump Administration only apportioned funds for the administration of the CDFI program on July 30 — more than four months after full-year appropriations had been enacted — and still has not apportioned the funds for making awards. By comparison, in 2024, those funds were apportioned roughly two weeks after the funds were appropriated.

Notably, the July 2025 apportionment of CDFI’s administrative funds came the day after 26 senators sent a bipartisan letter to OMB expressing concern over delays in making awards. That the Trump Administration has proposed severe cuts to the CDFI Fund for 2026 raises the clear possibility that its actions to illegally restrict congressionally provided support in 2025 through the apportionment process are an effort to unilaterally advance its desired policies despite the funding enacted into law.

Requiring Agency Spending Plans

OMB also conditioned many apportionments on its approval of a separate “agreed-upon spending plan” with the agency, above and beyond approval of the apportionment itself. These requirements can be found in over 100 apportionments approved by the Trump Administration between March and August of 2025, which affect at least six cabinet departments, as well as the Social Security Administration and other smaller agencies. Similar requirements — conditioning the availability of funds on OMB approval of an agency spending plan — have been used only rarely in prior administrations.

Further, in over half of those more than one hundred instances, OMB explicitly required the agency to provide a “detailed description” of how the spending plan “aligns with Administration priorities,” illegally delaying funds from being used for the purposes established in law in order to effectuate the Administration’s own spending priorities. In some cases, OMB laid out in the apportionment the minimal purposes for which it would allow an agency to spend funds in the absence of an approved spending plan — making clear that approval of the spending plan had not yet been given at the time an apportionment was approved.

With no transparency about what was required for a spending plan to meet OMB approval, the process is ripe for abuse and misuse. The Administration’s approach provides no way for the public to know if the information being required of agencies is merely an excuse to delay making funding available, or if agencies are required to give other unrelated policy assurances to OMB to gain access to their statutorily provided funds. It is at least possible that approval of some spending plans was conditioned on agencies providing assurances that they would not fully spend some portion of the lawfully provided funding. Arguably, given that the apportioned funds cannot be made available until these “agreed-upon” spending plans were approved, the plans themselves constitute “documents apportioning an appropriation,” which OMB is required to make publicly available under the law.

In the case of funding for the CDC’s public health programs targeting health promotion and chronic disease and injury prevention, no apportionment was received until July 29. But even worse, the apportionment stated that CDC could only “continue to make obligations for salaries and related administrative expenses” until OMB approved its spending plan, suggesting that had not yet occurred. This was confirmed in reporting on August 1 that CDC awards continued to be frozen, with an OMB spokesperson saying that “the CDC money is undergoing a programmatic review because the office is still waiting on CDC’s spending plan.” Thus, CDC still could not make awards with two months remaining in the fiscal year, leaving it unclear whether CDC can responsibly award all its lawfully provided funding before the September 30 deadline at the end of the fiscal year.

Using “Unallocated” Accounts

Finally, in at least a handful of instances, the Trump Administration apportioned significant funds as “unallocated” — apparently making them unavailable for use to execute the purposes Congress outlined in law, pending some later agreement — in accounts where that is uncommon, if not unprecedented. For example, at the Department of Education, over $600 million in Innovation and Improvement funds and roughly $500 million in Institute of Education Sciences funds were, and remain, apportioned as “unallocated.” The Trump Administration has proposed significant budget cuts for both in 2026. Further, apportionment footnotes reveal OMB plans to “automatically” re-apportion these unallocated funds once OMB agrees to their planned use — meaning that whether these impounded funds are ever released, or the purpose to which they are to be put if released, may remain hidden until after the fiscal year ends.

The apportionment data the Administration tried to illegally hide, and was ultimately forced to divulge, reinforces that the Trump Administration acted with the intention of illegally delaying and restricting funds lawfully provided by Congress. But it will take some time for auditors, Congress, public interest groups, and reporters to comb through all the recently released documents to fully understand the extent to which the Trump Administration has been abusing the apportionment process to advance its policy goals and aid in its illegal impoundments.

Defense Department to get a new name

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order Friday changing the name of the Department of Defense to the ""Department of War,"" reviving a title that was abandoned during a 1947 Cabinet reorganization. The move, confirmed by a White House official, is intended to reflect what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has described as the administration's effort to instill the ""warrior ethos"" across the armed forces. The move to go back to the Department of War comes, ironically, as Trump has tried to cast himself as a peacemaker.

HHS hearing hostility

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced a tense Senate committee hearing Thursday as lawmakers pummeled the Health secretary's changes to the department amid major overhauls at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

What's happening at HHS? There has been a mass exodus at the agency, including the loss of its director, but others left in protest of Kennedy's leadership and his controversial views on vaccines.

The departures have sparked turmoil. Now, some of the Trump administration's Republican allies in Congress are finding the chaos hard to ignore.

Calls for RFK Jr. to leave mounted: More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services officials on Thursday called for Kennedy to step down from his position.

Is Trump's immigration crackdown worsening school absenteeism?

""It's heartbreaking because at the root of it is fear of coming to school. There's a lot of fear from children, even if the children were born here in the United States, because one member of their family was not. They wonder, 'What’s going to happen to my uncle, mom, aunt or dad as a result?'""

~ Carlos Castillo, superintendent of Fresno Unified School District, which has a large, predominantly Hispanic immigrant population. USA TODAY examined how the Trump administration's increase in immigration enforcement has contributed to an increase in student absenteeism across the region as parents keep their kids home from school out of fear of being deportation or family separation.

ChatGPT-induced 'AI psychosis' is a real thing

In a conversation with ChatGPT, USA TODAY Wellness reporter Alyssa Goldberg told her AI therapist “Harry” that she was crashing out after seeing an ex for the first time in almost a year:

""No matter what I said, ChatGPT was gentle, caring and affirmative. No, I hadn’t done anything wrong. But in a separate conversation with a new 'Harry,' I flipped the roles. Rather than being the depressed ex-girlfriend, I roleplayed as an ex-boyfriend in a similar situation.""

Goldberg's finding? Unlike a real therapist, it refused to critique or investigate her behavior — regardless of which perspective she shared or what she said. It's evidence of how easy we can slip into “AI psychosis” — which isn’t a medical term, but is an evolving descriptor for AI’s impact on individuals vulnerable to paranoid or delusional thinking, such as those who have or are starting to develop a mental health condition.

Now, a handful of residents are coming together to push for change in local immigration policy.

The Proposal

Verónica Martínez is one of the latest to join Cleveland Heights for Immigrant Rights – a grassroots movement that wants city council to pass a nine-page resolution. The proposal includes a $200,000 pilot program for providing free legal counsel over the next two years. It is one of several of their demands.

“The other points are also very important,” Martínez said. ""One of them asks for the respect of the human rights that are in the Constitution.”

Her family is from Mexico and has been living in Cleveland Heights for nearly two years. Martínez said, for her, this project is personal.

“This country could not have been built without those brave people who were our predecessors and who were also here building and collaborating for this country,” Martínez said. “... It is very significant for us now to raise our voices for all those who cannot do so today.”

Karly Whitaker also joined the movement following the Cilantro ICE arrests. She’s taken on canvassing local businesses for support.

“We got over 70 businesses in our community that signed that pledge and then expressed some interest in ‘Know Your Rights’ training,” she said.

Following ICE arrests

Cilantro Taqueria said three of their workers who were detained in February self-deported while others are still in the process of obtaining citizenship.

Martínez said she has close connection to several of the restaurant workers, including one young, single mother. In her address to Cleveland Heights city officials, Martínez said the mother was released by ICE officers after discovering she had an 11-month-old baby.

“The people who were caring for her baby, frightened by what had happened, no longer wanted to care for him, so she was practically forced to flee. Today we do not know her whereabouts,” she said.

Looking Forward

The movement has received support from several councilmembers, Whitaker said, but, they’re hoping to create solidarity across the entire community.

“Our motto is, I believe, “all are welcome,” Whitaker said. “And like, it should be a community that embraces that diversity and make sure that all feel welcome and safe.”

Still, Martínez said, presenting the proposal is only the beginning of their fight.

“Our plans for the future it is to continue gathering, to continue uniting and to continue working,,” Martínez said. “We’re going to continue preparing people so they know their rights.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/cilantro-folo-main-photo,N,,2025-09-05 11:58:30.095364

“There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.” Immigrants' Medicaid under attack National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press. While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care.

The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.

“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”

The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. illegally off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.

At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.

“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”

Trump administration targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.

Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.

Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.

“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.

California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.

As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs and dental care.

Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.

“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud and abuse very seriously.”

It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.

California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.

Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.

And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”

“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”

Immigrants' Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.

“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

Wu has said the city continues to work with federal law enforcement on criminal cases and the DOJ lawsuit echoes that.
The Trust Act was first passed by the Boston City Council in 2014 and amended in 2019.
""While the City of Boston enjoys federal cooperation with the Boston Police Department— including with ICE-HSI—in criminal enforcement, the Boston Trust Act expressly shuts out substantially all cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement,"" the suit says.
The DOJ argues that ICE is carrying out its mission to enforce the country's immigration laws following directions and using methods provided by Congress.","Mayor Michelle Wu said Boston ""will not yield"" as the U.S. Department of Justice sues the city over its policy to restrict police cooperation with non-criminal federal immigration enforcement.

The DOJ announced Thursday that it had filed a civil suit against Boston, Wu and Police Commissioner Michael Cox seeking to have a federal judge invalidate ""Boston's sanctuary city laws that interfere with the federal government's enforcement of its immigration laws.""

At issue is the so-called Trust Act, which bars city police from honoring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to keep a person in police custody for longer than required while the federal agency considers the person's immigration status. Wu has said the city continues to work with federal law enforcement on criminal cases and the DOJ lawsuit echoes that.

""The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America – they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,"" U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. ""If Boston won't protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.""

Wu, who has repeatedly defended the city as it has attracted the ire of the Trump administration, said the latest ""unconstitutional attack on our city is not a surprise.""

""Boston is a thriving community, the economic and cultural hub of New England, and the safest major city in the country — but this administration is intent on attacking our community to advance their own authoritarian agenda,"" she said in a statement. The mayor added, ""This is our City, and we will vigorously defend our laws and the constitutional rights of cities, which have been repeatedly upheld in courts across the country. We will not yield.""

Massachusetts has not declared itself a ""sanctuary state,"" but the state and its capital city have been popular targets of the Trump administration amid pushback against policies that federal officials see as lenient towards immigrants.

Boston's Trust Act explicitly tells local law enforcement they ""shall not detain an individual solely on the basis of a civil immigration detainer request or an ICE administrative warrant after the individual is eligible for release from custody, unless ICE has a criminal warrant, issued by a Judicial Officer, for the individual.""

The Trust Act was first passed by the Boston City Council in 2014 and amended in 2019.

In its 2017 Lunn decision, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts state law ""provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody.""

The DOJ's lawsuit says Boston police ""honored all civil immigration detainer requests from ICE"" throughout 2015, but has since stopped doing so ""as the national crisis with illegal immigration reached its peak.""

The suit claims that Boston ""singles out the Federal Government for disfavored treatment"" with its policy but also notes that the city does still work with the feds on criminal and homeland security matters.

""While the City of Boston enjoys federal cooperation with the Boston Police Department— including with ICE-HSI—in criminal enforcement, the Boston Trust Act expressly shuts out substantially all cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement,"" the suit says.

The DOJ argues that ICE is carrying out its mission to enforce the country's immigration laws following directions and using methods provided by Congress. And by resisting what Congress has authorized, the suit says the Boston policy ""requires federal immigration officers either (1) to engage in difficult and dangerous efforts to re-arrest aliens who were previously in local custody, endangering immigration officers, the particular alien, and others who may be nearby, or (2) to determine that it is not appropriate to transfer an alien to local custody in the first place, in order to comply with their mission to enforce the immigration laws.""

U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Boston called the DOJ lawsuit a scare tactic and said she does not want the city to be intimidated by the Trump administration ""as they continue terrorizing our communities.""

""Nothing the Trump Administration has done since taking office has been about public safety. From the militarization of our cities, to abducting our neighbors off the street, to sham, baseless lawsuits like this one—it has always been about sowing fear, punishing dissent, and tearing apart hardworking immigrant families,"" Pressley said.

The many changes to immigration enforcement policies introduced by the Trump administration since the president’s inauguration in January has led what some Catholic dioceses are calling “terror” to take hold of Spanish-speaking parishioners throughout the United States.

CNA asked dioceses around the country what effects, if any, the administration’s changing policies have had on Spanish Mass attendance. While responses varied — some dioceses have noted declines while others have seen increased attendance — one theme appeared throughout: Immigrants are filled with fear.

‘It’s more than fear — it’s terror’

The Archdiocese of Atlanta has not collected data on Mass attendance, and any changes in attendance, if any, are “very small,” according to Yolanda Muñoz, the director of Hispanic and Latino ministries for the archdiocese.

She told CNA that although people are “very afraid,” their “faith is strong and they find ways around” their fears. Some carpool with people who have legal status. Many have created WhatsApp chats “to inform one another if there are areas of danger to avoid.”

Muñoz said some priests are even going to places where “there is a heavy concentration of immigrants, like trailer parks” to say Mass.

The archdiocese has held informational meetings in parishes at which immigrants are educated in their rights as well as in ways to plan and protect themselves and their families if they are deported.

Although the current “situation is very difficult and very sad, we must keep on reminding ourselves that Christ is in the boat in the middle of the storm,” Muñoz said.

Archbishop Gustavo García-Siller of the Archdiocese of San Antonio told CNA he had not heard from priests that people were avoiding going to church, although on the day he spoke with CNA, he said he had just heard from a local priest about three families that were taken into custody.

He stressed that “fear is there. It’s more than fear — it’s terror.”

Nevertheless, he said that at least in San Antonio, people “trust the Church and their communities” because they have faith.

García-Siller said he thinks San Antonio is unique because there is more acceptance of immigrants there due to integration that has been ongoing for decades in the city.

“In San Antonio, we have Spanish Masses in almost all parishes … Hispanics here go to any parish,” he said.

According to the archbishop, the federal government has, until February of this year, asked the Church in San Antonio to help immigrants, and the Church responded, through Catholic Charities, with humanitarian aid, medical and legal assistance, counseling, and spiritual support.

“What is beautiful to see in San Antonio is that these services are not done only by professionals but also people from the parishes, laity, religious men and women, brothers, religious nuns and diocesan priests,” he said.

“I have seen in the last few months more people in need. People are eating less, they are avoiding getting health care, and some even avoid going to school,” he said.

(Story continues below)

“We don’t ask them if they have papers or not,” he continued. “Because of the rhetoric in the country, people are very damaged, very scared. We avoid divisive narratives.”

The prelate said that immigrants “know that we as the Church, the body of Christ, we are for them.”

‘Less likely to linger after Mass’

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Las Vegas told CNA the archdiocese had noted a decline in participation at some Hispanic parishes, “particularly in Mass attendance and religious education enrollment.”

“One parish that would typically see around 1,500 children in its first Communion program has closer to 860 this year,” according to the archdiocese. ”In addition, families seem less likely to linger after Mass for community activities and socializing.”

Parishioners expressing ‘apprehension and fear’

Secretary for Communications and Public Affairs for the Archdiocese of Boston Terrence Donilon told CNA that the climate of “uncertainty” has resulted in “a stressful time for ethnic communities in the Commonwealth” of Massachusetts, with parishes rescheduling or seeking “alternatives” for summer festivals used for parish fellowship and fundraising.

“Anecdotally some pastors, though not all, have noticed Mass attendance among non-Anglo parishioners decline during this period of concern,” Donilon said.

Alayna Fox of the Diocese of Burlington, Vermont, told CNA that “while the Diocese of Burlington does not have a large population of native Spanish speakers, it has been reported that attendance at the Masses offered in Spanish have experienced a drop in attendance.”

The communications director for the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, Tara Bishop, noted that there had been a decline in attendance recently, though she said the diocese could not “definitively attribute” it to immigration policies.

She went on to say that many parishioners had “expressed apprehension and fear about participating in various parish events.”

However, Bishop said that “it is common to see a significant drop in attendance at Eucharistic celebrations during the summer months, so this decline may be part of a seasonal trend rather than a direct result of immigration policy changes.”

Need for a ‘spiritual dimension in this time of stress’

Echoing Bishop, Father Will Banowsky of Holy Spirit Catholic Church located in the southwest part of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City said that seasonal effects on attendance rather than fear of immigration enforcement seemed to explain declines in Spanish Mass participation throughout the summer.

“A lot of people went back to their countries in the summer, or they went on vacation,” he said.

Many returned for the start of the school year, he said. There were 920 people at a recent Spanish Mass at Holy Spirit, whose congregation is about 50% Hispanic and where the average is closer to 650-800.

Banowsky told CNA that the higher-than-average attendance numbers in August could be attributed to people knowing they need that “spiritual dimension in this time of stress.”

While he said his parish and others in the archdiocese have not been “hurting” regarding attendance, he said there is still a lot of fear among Hispanic parishioners, and “social media doesn’t help.”

“We try to make sure people can find a refuge from their fears here, whatever those fears may be,” he said.",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Immigrants_Credit_Diego_G_Diaz_Shutterstock_CNA.jpg?jpg,N,,2025-09-05 13:57:38.084635

(AP) — U.S. immigration authorities on Thursday raided the sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in southeast Georgia, conducting a search that shut down construction on an adjacent factory being built to produce EV batteries.

The operation targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by the governor and other officials as the largest economic development project in the state’s history. Hyundai Motor Group began manufacturing EVs a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities were conducting an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre (1,214-hectare) site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant “as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.” It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested.

Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.

Video posted to social media Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: “We’re Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.”

“We need construction to cease immediately,” the man says. “We need all work to end on the site right now.”

President Donald Trump's administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

In addition to making electric vehicles at the site facing Interstate 16 in Bryan County, Hyundai has also partnered with LG Energy Solution to build the battery plant. It's slated to open sometime next year.

The joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, “is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities,” the company said in a statement. “To assist their work, we have paused construction.”

Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.

The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.
But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.
“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director.
“I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals.","Federal land managers have had a rough time implementing contentious plans to eliminate roughly 3,600 free-roaming horses from 2.1 million acres of southwest Wyoming, where private and public land are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern.

Although U.S. District Judge Kelly Rankin of Wyoming concluded last year that the Bureau of Land Management’s whole-herd removal plan is legal, his decision was appealed and roundups were postponed, and then in July the plan was declared at odds with the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The federal appellate judges out of Denver sent the case back to the Wyoming court to remedy legal deficiencies. The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.

But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.

“[T]he BLM Rock Springs Field Office still plans to proceed with the permanent removal of wild horses in the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town Herd Areas, with operations expected to begin on or about Oct. 13, 2025,” Jacqueline Alderman, a spokesperson for the agency’s ?High Desert District, wrote in an email.

It remains unclear how the agency will address the three-judge panel’s concerns. “The BLM cannot comment on ongoing litigation,” Alderman wrote.

Pro-horse plaintiffs aim to stop the mid-October roundups from happening.

On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.”

Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand.

“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said.

And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others.

Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.

“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”

Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next.

“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.

“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.”

Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property.

“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.”

But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/adobe-town-2-scaled1757024666.jpeg?h=7207289a&itok=DqPUhB-9,N,,2025-09-05 10:56:52.091202

Officials say as many as 300 federal agents are expected to operate out of Naval Station Great Lakes each day to conduct operations in Chicago.

Naval Station Great Lakes is serving as a logistical hub for the agents.

The president has argued the operations are to increase safety in Chicago though community leaders have doubts about those claims.

Protests expected at Broadview ICE facility

Its expected demonstrators will descend on the location because it's expected to be the main processing hub for those detained by ICE as a part of their upcoming operation.

Village officials said federal authorities informed them that as a part of a large scale enforcement operation, the facility would serve as a primary processing location. It will operate seven days a week for the next month-and-a-half.

Broadview's mayor adds that the village is coordinating its efforts with local law enforcement including the illinois state police and the Cook County Sheriff's police to help ensure safety and order.

While touring a school in west suburban Berwyn to listen to concerns from residents about the ICE operations, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stressed that protests must remain peaceful, so as not to give the trump administration any excuse to deploy the National Guard.

""But part of their kinda nefarious plan is: begin with ICE. Cause mayhem on the ground. And by doing that, say that there's a need for military troops on the ground to protect ICE,"" Pritzker said. ""That's why I've talked a lot about for the people that are going to protest they've gotta protest peacefully. Not give them any reason to call in the National Guard or military troops of other types.""

Village officials said they have also been working to help prepare local businesses for any demonstrations. Protests could begin Friday morning.

The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.

The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.

Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia. The operation marks one of the latest examples of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown at workplaces across the country.

All 475 people taken into custody were illegally present in the US, Schrank said. He said some had overstayed their visas.

The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.

The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported. The facility has been touted by Georgia’s governor as the largest economic development site in the state’s history, the AP said.

Hyundai is cooperating with law enforcement and is “committed to abiding by all labor and immigration regulations,” spokesperson Michael Stewart said.

The same day, hundreds of miles away in upstate New York, dozens of workers at a family-owned plant that makes nutrition bars were also apprehended during an ICE raid, officials said, drawing the ire of Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.

GOP governor promoted the Metaplant

At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”

ATF Atlanta said the operation led “to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.”

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has touted the Hyundai Metaplant as a boon for the Georgia economy.

In 2022, Hyundai announced an agreement with the state of Georgia to build Hyundai’s “first dedicated fully electrified vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities in the United States” in Bryan County, the company said.

The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.

“With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.

CNN has asked Kemp’s office for comment about Thursday’s immigration raid at the Metaplant.

Dozens apprehended in New York raid

In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.

The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.

The group estimates that “upwards of 70 employees” were questioned and “nearly all” were then arrested and taken to the nearby Oswego Detention Center. A spokesperson for the group told CNN they’re still waiting to hear from authorities about exactly how many were detained.

Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.

“I am outraged by this morning’s ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.

Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”

ICE confirmed to CNN affiliate WSTM that it carried out a “court-authorized enforcement action” in Cato. Employees told WSTM that around 60 workers were detained. CNN has reached out to the agency for further details.

Mark Schmidt, the owner of Nutrition Bar Confectioners, told the New York Times that all his workers had legal documentation to work in the US. “We’ve done everything we can to vet people we hire,” he said.

Schmidt described the ICE raid as “overkill.” His son Lenny Schmidt, the company’s vice president, told the Times the scene was “almost theatrical,” describing police dogs and all-terrain vehicles involved in the operation.

“It could have been handled so much more humanely and decently,” he said. “This kind of raid, you feel like it’s a drug bust or a human trafficking situation.”

NEW BEDFORD – Federal immigration agents arrested a Guatemalan man on Thursday morning while he was checking on a property he owns in the South End, according to family members.

Jose Bonilla, 58, who lives in Everett, was stopped by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the intersection of Roosevelt Street and Cove Road. He had traveled to check on one of his three properties in New Bedford, a building he owns on Cleveland Street.

Carolina Zavora, a relative who was accompanying Bonilla in the car, said the agents had been waiting at the property and followed them when they left. She saw at least two SUVs, additional vehicles, and five agents. According to Zavora, the agents showed Bonilla a photo of one of his former tenants when they pulled them over.

“He told them it wasn’t him in the photo,” she said in Spanish. “Then they asked for his license.”

Zavora said Bonilla explained to the agents that he came to New Bedford only to check on his property. He also told them he had an open petition for a visa through his wife, Norma Umana, a green card holder. After looking at his license, Zavora said, the agents told him the petition had been rejected.

“How is that possible?” said Kimberly Samanta Portillo Umana, Bonilla’s daughter, who drove from Everett to pick up her father’s car. “When we checked, it was still processing.”

Portillo Umana said that after the arrest, she called their lawyer, who confirmed via the USCIS website that the petition is still processing.

According to Massachusetts court records, Bonilla had a misdemeanor charge for unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in Chelsea District Court, which was dismissed in 2007.

Bonilla’s wife, who is from Guatemala, said she is a volunteer with Latinos Unidos en Massachusetts (LUMA), an immigrant advocacy group. She left for El Salvador on Wednesday and had planned to stay for a few weeks, but is now trying to return early.

“I’m checking flights now to come back and be with my family,” she said. “This is stupid. People are working, but they don’t have freedom anymore.”

As she spoke with The Light, Umana received an incoming call. “My son is calling me,” she said. “I don’t even know how to tell him.”

Lucy Pineda, founder and director of LUMA, said the call she received from Umana on Thursday about Bonilla’s arrest was one of five she got that morning.

“It’s sad because this is another case, and it’s close to us, and we have many cases every day, every hour,” she said.

Since the start of the current administration, Pineda said, LUMA has been keeping track of arrests across the state based on calls they receive from family members.

“We’ve been helping families because they don’t know how the process works,” she said. “So we help them to find where they’ve been detained.”

As of Thursday afternoon, the ICE detainee locator did not list Bonilla’s location. ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

The Light has confirmed that ICE has arrested more than 50 people in the Greater New Bedford area since February.

Bonilla’s arrest in New Bedford comes more than a month after the most recent reported local immigration arrest. On July 26, Jhovani Duvan Leiva Cornejo was arrested in the Port of New Bedford after returning from a fishing trip. On July 23, ICE, alongside the U.S. Coast Guard, detained Luis Guillermo Castro Alvarez. Two days before, ICE detained an undocumented Salvadoran man, Juan Carlos Abarca-Jovel.

In other ICE actions today, agents questioned another man in New Bedford’s North End about his residency status about four hours before they arrested Bonilla.

Dashcam video provided to The Light by the man, who asked not to be identified due to concerns around his asylum process, shows a masked agent wearing military garb exiting a large vehicle with New Jersey plates at 6:10 a.m. The agent approached the man, who is from Guatemala, and asked: “¿Tienes documentos?” [Do you have documents?] Shortly afterward, another masked agent who had parked farther down the street is seen walking toward the scene.

The man told The Light that agents let him go shortly after they noticed that he wore a GPS monitor around his ankle.

“I have no problem with ICE,” he said in Spanish. “I have my papers in order.”

Since Trump returned to power in January, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has been bolstered by record funding and new latitude to conduct raids.

The president has said he wants to deport “the worst of the worst” criminals. But ICE figures show a rise in the detainment of non-criminals.

Lee did not specify exactly how many South Koreans were detained, calling the number “large,” but media reports suggested that 300 or more had been taken into custody.

Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday that the raid resulted from a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site and was the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The Thursday raid targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai Motor Group a year ago began manufacturing electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant west of Savannah that employs about 1,200 people. Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have touted it as the state’s largest-ever largest economic development project.

Agents focused their operation on an adjacent plant that’s still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries batteries that power EVs.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Lee said the ministry is dispatching diplomats from its embassy in Washington and consulate in Atlanta to the site, and planning to form an on-site response team.

Schrank told reporters in Savannah that while some of the detained workers illegally crossed the U.S. border, others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working. He said some of those detained worked for the battery manufacturer, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site.

Schrank said he didn’t know precisely how many of the 475 detained were Korean nationals, but that they made up a majority. No one has yet been charged with any crimes, he said, but the investigation is ongoing.

“This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks, and put them on buses,” Schrank said. “This has been a multi-month criminal investigation where we have developed evidence and conducted interviews, gathered documents and presented that evidence to the court in order to obtain a judicial search warrant.”

He said most of the detainees were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line.

President Donald Trump’s administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

The Hyundai site sits on 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares) in a largely rural area of Bryan County, drawing in workers from several surrounding counties and communities including the city of Savannah, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.

Hyundai began producing electric vehicles at the site last September. A few months later, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chairman Euisun Chung during a White House appearance with Trump credited the president with the company’s decision to create more American jobs by building an EV factory in Georgia.

“Our decision to invest in Savannah, Georgia, creating more than 8,500 American jobs, was initiated during my meeting with President Trump in Seoul in 2019,” Chung said at the March event.

The battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is slated to open next year.

In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was “closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.” It said it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

“Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,” the company said.

Operations at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing plant weren’t interrupted by the raid, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson. Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday it was “working to understand the specific circumstances” of the raid and detentions.

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company’s statement said. “We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.”

HL-GA Battery Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. In a statement Thursday, the company said it’s “cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities.”

About 20,000 of those employees came from outside ICE, the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, found, including some agencies that have sent significant portions of their workforces to the deportation effort. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations, which is responsible for investigating transnational crimes including drug and human trafficking, has sent more than 12,000 employees to the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division. HSI as of the most recent data on ICE’s website had “more than 10,000 employees,” meaning it has both grown and sent nearly its entire workforce to assist with immigration enforcement.

ERO itself has around 6,000 officers on staff.

Many of the other employees detailed to ICE come from the Justice Department, including the Bureau of Prisons, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshal Service and Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The State Department has sent nearly 300 Diplomatic Security staff to ERO to aid in deportation efforts, while the Internal Revenue Service has around more than 1,700 employees assisting ICE. That marks a significant ramp up from June, when Government Executive reported IRS had 250 of its agents detailed to the Homeland Security Department.

Other DHS components are also contributing to ICE’s immigration enforcement crackdown: Customs and Border Protection has detailed more than 5,000 employees toward the effort, while U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has sent more than 4,000. Government Executive previously reported USCIS staff working on refugee operations in the Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate were pushed by their leadership to accept details to ICE to demonstrate their ""adaptability"" and to “justify our continued employment.” About one-quarter of the refugee office was detailed to ICE as of June.

The responsibilities of the detailees have varied. IRS agents have been authorized to make arrests for civil violations of immigration law, while USCIS employees were largely working on administrative matters like verifying an immigrant’s status or correcting information for ICE.

Some employees temporarily assigned to ICE are serving for limited periods, such as 60 days or six months, while others, such as those from CBP, are working for the enforcement agency indefinitely.

DEA has assigned nearly 40% of its total employees to ICE, according to Cato’s data, while the ATF has sent nearly 30% and USMS around 20%.

Some new details that did come up, however, revealed that the state initiated conversations with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the potential of converting the McCook center to ICE use.

Most of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee attended a closed-door meeting Thursday to discuss the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp.

Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style prison into a 300-bed immigration detention facility over the next 45 days.

While several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee have said they were notified of the plan shortly before the public announcement, Democrats on the committee were excluded. A group of 13 progressive lawmakers then submitted a letter requesting a public hearing to cover questions about the proposal. The Governor’s Office and Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln then organized the briefing.

Several state officials reportedly attended to answer questions, including Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys and Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, former prosecutor in Lancaster County and a former chief of the criminal bureau for the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Neither were available to answer questions after. They took a separate exit down the hall from where reporters had gathered.

Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature who did not sign the letter requesting a public hearing, said state officials were not able to provide many answers to her questions, including whether the McCook facility has the capacity to house the ICE detainees or the funds to cover the expected costs of the conversion.

During the meeting, DeBoer said officials did share that Nebraska reached out to Homeland Security about repurposing the McCook center — and not the other way around — following a social media post by President Donald Trump inquiring about states with space to house such a facility.

She did not specify which Nebraska official reached out. But Pillen has made several trips to Washington, D.C., and to the White House.

DeBoer said she was told there is currently no agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services to convert the McCook facility into a detention center, but she expects one to be completed within the next 60 days.

This contradicts or clarifies Pillen’s estimates last month that the repurposed facility would be operational within 45 days. Bosn said her understanding is that the ICE center would open around 45 to 60 days after the agreement is finalized.

DeBoer said she was told that the existing employees at McCook would remain state employees through the transition and that the repurposed center would house “low-level” inmates, or inmates that meet an ICE-specific classification.

The new center will house only adults, according to Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also attended the briefing. He said officials were unable to clarify whether detainees will be only men, or a mix of men and women, but noted that there won’t be any mixing of Nebraska inmates with ICE detainees.

As for what will happen with the state inmates currently housed in McCook, DeBoer said some will go to various community corrections centers, where they may have been transferred naturally. Others will be reabsorbed into other prisons, and DeBoer said there was talk that some of the other eastern Nebraska prisons may need to expand their low-level security housing areas, as the McCook center currently has a large share of those available beds.

Bosn said she was reassured at the briefing when Jeffreys said no existing inmates should lose access to resources or lose progress in their programming as a result of the transition. She said Jeffreys told her he has an employee dedicated to ensuring the transition goes smoothly.

Jeffreys reportedly told meeting attendees that Nebraska’s overall prison bed capacity was at 98%. Rountree said an engineer is currently examining the capacity of the McCook prison.

The Work Ethic Camp currently houses 168 inmates, and DeBoer noted the facility was originally designed for 100. Pillen’s press release claimed the center is currently at 84% of bed capacity. Either way, DeBoer said the repurposed center would likely be crowded.

With Nebraska having one of the most overcrowded prison systems in the country, some have expressed concerns about how a new ICE center might exacerbate the problem by eliminating one of the state’s existing prisons.

Corrections is already dealing with displacing 387 inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln after an August windstorm tore the roof off of two buildings, which are currently under repair. DeBoer said Jeffreys told senators the penitentiary is also dealing with a new water problem that occurred this week.

Bosn said she “disagrees with the narrative” that Nebraska’s prisons are overcrowded. She argued that since the overall system’s capacity is below 100%, that means there’s still room. But DeBoer said the combination of capacity concerns and the quick timeline for the project has her worried about what the conditions will be like in the repurposed center.

“My confidence is a little shaken about whether or not the Department of Homeland Security will live up to the standards that I would want Nebraskans to have,” DeBoer said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

DeBoer visited the McCook facility Wednesday and said she met with people who were considering modifications that may be needed to transform the building into an ICE detention center. She mentioned that they were considering installing a second fence but said officials at the briefing did not share other details about what modifications would be necessary.

She said she asked if the new center would have space for detainees to consult with attorneys and got no answer. The current center has little need for such meetings, DeBoer said, as most of the inmates are there late in their sentences. During her visit, she said she didn’t see any space that could be used for that purpose.

Rountree said state officials also were unsure about how much it would cost to make this transition, although he got the indication that hosting the center might be helpful toward state finances.

Repurposing the Work Ethic Camp won’t just reduce bed space within Nebraska’s prison system, DeBoer said, but it would also eliminate a facility with a specific mission that was set by the Legislature in 1997.

Though it is crowded, DeBoer said WEC appears to have better conditions for its inhabitants relative to other Nebraska prisons, including offering better food and overall more humane treatment.

“I took the time to look out the windows, and they look over a meadow,” DeBoer said.

Of the questions asked in the letter that prompted the briefing, one that was not addressed was whether the executive branch has the authority to initiate this project. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

DeBoer said she purposefully didn’t ask about this because she didn’t think it would be a “productive” conversation. She believes her opinion on the topic differs from that of the governor’s team and said the question is better left for the courts.

In Pillen’s press release, he argues that state statute gives him the authority through the creation of the Department of Correctional Services, as well as an article in the Nebraska Constitution that states that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

DeBoer said there may be enough reason to justify the Legislature filing a lawsuit to challenge Pillen, though she said she had no details on whether such a lawsuit is coming.

The meeting was closed to the press and lawmakers outside the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln tried to attend, but was quickly kicked out.

Conrad said Bosn told her the meeting was meant to be for Judiciary Committee members only. But she countered that in Bosn’s own words from her letter responding to progressives, the committee “has no more extraordinary authority than any individual senator, or group of senators, to seek answers” to their questions.

“Senator Bosn’s public statements, and now private actions, stand in sharp contradiction to each other,” Conrad said.

Bosn countered that committees commonly hold private meetings open only to committee members and said Conrad has the same ability to call a meeting of her own. DeBoer declined to comment on Conrad’s exclusion.

As Congress and the country reconvene after summer break, and as we take stock of what has happened and what is to come, we again ask “at what cost” is the Trump administration willing to go to pursue its mass deportation agenda?

Below, we highlight the costs to children and communities; the costs to our economy, and the costs to our democracy due to the mass deportation crusade on display – as well as the potential political costs citing the growing opposition among most Americans witnessing the mass deportation agenda in action:

Costs of mass deportation on children, families, schools and communities

Recent heartbreaking stories of Dreamers detained, moms and dads deported, and, literally, prioritizing the detention of firefighters over the fighting of a fire remind us of the human toll – and screwed up priorities – of the Trump/Miller mass deportation agenda. But the fears and traumas associated with Back to School season this year perhaps most viscerally captures the costs on real people and communities.

Trauma on kids this back to school season: At an America’s Voice virtual press conference held in late August, educators, child psychologists, and immigration experts discussed how the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda is harming kids and changing educators’ focus this back-to-school season. Watch a recording of the Back to School virtual event here.

During the virtual event, following remarks from leaders from AFT, NEA and a Washington, DC-based child psychologist, Alberto Carvalho, Superintendent, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) said:

“Schools must always be safe havens for learning, free from fear or disruption. Immigration enforcement activities have no place on or around our campuses, as they create an atmosphere of anxiety that harms every student, regardless of background.”

Costs of mass deportation on key American industries and our economy

From worries about crops rotting in fields due to labor shortages to Americans’ paychecks shrinking due to immigration restrictions, the economic cost of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda on key American industries and all of us has been a major storyline this summer.

Economists, farmers, workers’ advocates and new analysis on the costs of mass deportation: At an August virtual event convened by America’s Voice, economists, farmers, and workers’ advocates gathered to assess the costs to key American industries and their workforce of the mass deportation agenda. As we noted, “Trump’s mass deportation assault disrupts our economy and drives up prices on groceries and housing for all Americans. This isn’t just bad immigration policy – it’s economic sabotage that hurts working families and damages entire communities.” Read the post event release here and watch a recording of the virtual event here.

During the event, Chris Gibbs, President, Rural Voice USA, and Rural Voices Network, noted:

“As a farmer, this immigration report only verifies what I already knew and it’s intuitive to my fellow farmers know as well is this ham-handed immigration enforcement action is by this administration just adds one more layer of uncertainty to the environment created by the tariff debacle, no new real trade deals to market my corn and soy beans and continuing rise in input cost of doing business on the farm.”

The event also featured the release of new analysis by Economic Insights and Research Consulting detailing the economic damage already underway on our economy and the ag, construction, and leisure/hospitality industries. Read “Warning Signs of the Economic Harms from Deportations“

Costs to our democracy of the mass deportation agenda

Using the pretext of immigration and crime concerns, the Trump administration is taking aim at core American rights and protections and advancing a brand of authoritarianism that is at odds with core democratic ideals. Meanwhile, Trump/Miller are building his own personal police force. Given the unprecedented funding for ICE, and the administration’s disdain for law and order – will there be any hiring standards beyond fealty to MAGA?

Immigration is the “tip of the spear” in broader dangerous agenda: Denying people the right to bond hearings, targeting political opponents, firing immigration judges and fast tracking the removal of individuals without due process are all interrelated parts of the mass deportation crusade and elements that threaten all Americans’ basic rights and protections. Read the recent AV statement: “Trump’s Escalating Attacks on Democracy”

As Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) noted about the deployment of military against American communities:

“Any rational person who has spent even the most minimal amount of time studying human history has to ask themselves one important question: Once they get the citizens of this nation comfortable with the current atrocities committed under the color of law, what comes next?”

New task force and ICE recruitment – creating Stephen Miller’s private army? Included in a late August executive order was the creation of a new task force, helmed by Stephen Miller, that will “create an online portal for ‘Americans with law enforcement or other relevant backgrounds and experience’ to apply to join federal agents in enforcing Mr. Trump’s ‘crime emergency’ order” per the NYT. Meanwhile, much about the unprecedented ICE hiring spree should raise alarms – from cash bounties for arrests and hiring teenagers to the disturbing motivations of potential applicants. Read more on the topic here and read a related assessment in The Bulwark here.

The public opposition and political costs to mass deportation agenda

The more Americans witness the Trump/Miller mass deportation agenda, the more they reject it. A strong majority of the public, including Latino voters, are consistent in what they want: order at the border, enforcement targeted at actual public safety threats, legal channels for hardworking individuals and a process for Dreamers and long-settled immigrants to become U.S. citizens – not targets for detention or deportation. And a range of recent polling on the administration’s militarization of American communities similarly finds broad opposition.

Concluding thoughts

The high costs of the mass deportation agenda are growing more clear. They also are being used as a pretext and excuse – the “tip of the spear” – for the broader and dangerous assault on our democracy. We’re in a perilous moment, not just for immigrant communities but for all Americans concerned with our basic conceptions of self-governance, our rights and core pillars of democracy.

It is fully within the power of Congress – including some of the Republicans selectively speaking out about the harms and excesses of mass deportation- to push for a new path forward on immigration and to defend our democracy. They are on the wrong side of voters and the wrong side of history.",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RedFence-1200x800.png,N,,2025-09-05 15:57:52.628864

475 arrested at Georgia Hyundai site in biggest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations history

A multi-agency immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant site in Georgia led to the apprehension of 475 people, a Homeland Security Investigations official said Friday.The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia.

He said some had overstayed their visas.The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported.

The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.

The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.

GOP governor promoted the Metaplant

At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”

The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.

“With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.

CNN has asked Kemp’s office for comment about Thursday’s immigration raid at the Metaplant.

Dozens apprehended in New York raid

In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.

The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.

Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.

“I am outraged by this morning’s ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.

Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”

The new camp is believed to hold about 1,000 people, with expansion to 5,000 in the near future.

According to official statements, the facilities there will be used as short-term processing centers for people in the process of removal, under the responsibility of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Defense only provides the land and logistics.

Funding contracts included $231.8 million, awarded to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a company with no prior experience in such work. The new camp, named Camp East Montana, is temporary on paper, offering even a prayer area for those inside — but in reality it is the largest immigration detainment facility in U.S. history.

Housing migrants on a military base entails a lack of transparency in detention. Fort Bliss is a restricted-access site where journalists, independent observers, and human rights advocates will not be admitted. This creates a “black zone” where those in custody are left without witnesses and without oversight.

For many, it brings back repeated trauma — people who fled wars and prison abuse now return to the sight of barracks, barbed wire, and military vehicles around them. Such placement erases the line between a civilian immigration system and a military prison, creating a model ready for scaling up.

But to house migrants on military bases fits perfectly into the Trump 2.0’s strategy on immigration enforcement. The point is that a show of strength and resolve at the border shifts the immigration issue from a civilian to a militarized domain.

This is first and foremost a signal to voters, especially Republican voters, of “uncompromising and tough control.” Republican governors, especially in Texas and Florida, support the idea, seeing it as a way to bypass restrictions and speed up deportations.

The danger is in making such measures the norm. When military infrastructure starts working for domestic politics, it stops being a crisis-response tool and becomes a permanent element of governance and intimidation. Its further development will only make it harder to return immigration control to civilian institutions.

All this is looking less and less like a tent camp in the desert and more like the birth of a new system. The lack of resistance to it will create a blueprint for national networks of military camps, where law and transparency give way to the discipline of the garrison.

ICE announced in July that immigrants who arrive in the United States illegally will no longer be eligible for bond.

A new class action lawsuit, with the help of immigration attorney Hans Meyer, claims this is not legal.

""Immigration law for 30 years has clearly outlined that people who've lived in the country for a long period of time, if picked up by ICE, are eligible for bond,"" Meyer said. ""What we see now is a new policy by the government with a complete reversal of that position after three decades without any explanation or reason.""

The legal question a judge will need to decide is: ""Should immigrants who are in our country illegally be allowed to ask for bond?""

The lawsuit isn't arguing to release detainees, but that they should have the chance to ask for bond.

""This problem is impacting thousands of people in Colorado. Anybody who lives in this state who entered at any time, no matter how long ago. So, for example, someone who came in when they were two or three years old, grew up here, maybe got DACA status as a young person, and has now been arrested by ICE, for over three decades, that person would be eligible for bond,"" Meyer said.

Class action lawsuit challenges ICE's ""no bond"" policy for detained immigrants

That includes Nestor Mendoza Gutierrez.

He became one of the first to file a case claiming his detention is unlawful, according to Meyer. Now he's the face of the class action lawsuit.

""He's lived in this country for nearly 27 years. He's married, he has children, he's a hard-working person, he pays taxes, so he's fully stable in our community, and he's lived in Colorado, frankly, more than most people who live in this state,"" Meyer said.

The lawsuit could be decided on in a matter of weeks, according to Meyer.

""So the class action lawsuit is designed to address one legal question that applies to 1000s of people. That way, 1000s of people don't have to file separate petitions for Habeas Corpus in the federal courts, and the court can address one legal issue that applies to several 100 and in this case, what will actually be several thousand people,"" he explained.

Denver7 reached out to ICE to ask about the agency's take on the policy change, and what the plan is if detention centers become overcrowded.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments in the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

President Trump is expected to unilaterally reinterpret the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime treaty in order to sell advanced military drones abroad, according to a U.S. official and other sources. Under the plan, the United States will designate drones as aircraft, rather than missile systems, the U.S. official said, adding that the effort is the first part of a planned “major review” of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

The United States will continue to unilaterally “blow up” foreign drug traffickers if needed, but also hopes to do so in collaboration with “friendly governments” that will help the U.S. forces “find these people and blow them up,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday. Separately, Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello described the recent U.S. strike on an alleged drug smuggling vessel as an “extrajudicial killing.” Ione Wells reports for BBC News; John Hudson and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

Rubio also announced that the United States has designated two Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. According to Rubio, the designation brings “all sorts of options” for Washington to work with Ecuador to crack down on the groups. Matthew Lee, Regina Garcia Cano, and Jacquelyn Martin report for AP News.

Two Venezuelan military aircraft yesterday flew near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters in a “highly provocative move” that was “designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations,” the U.S. Defense Department said in a social media statement. Rashard Rose reports for CNN.

The United States has violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by being responsible for an Afghan man’s two-year-long arbitrary detention in Abu Dhabi, a U.N. Human Rights Council Working Group found in an opinion published this week. The man, a former police force colonel who had worked with U.S. forces, was evacuated to the United Arab Emirates during the hurried U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. The Group held the United States and United Arab Emirates jointly responsible for breaching the Covenant. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

The Trump administration is preparing to start renegotiating the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Sources familiar with the administration’s thinking say the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is scheduled to begin public consultations on the free trade agreement within the next month. Gavin Bade, Santiago Pérez, and Vipal Monga report for the Wall Street Journal.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump is expected to nominate Lt. Gen. William Hartman to lead the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, sources say. Hartman has been the acting leader of both agencies since Trump fired Gen. Timothy Haugh from the role in April. Daniel Lippman and Maggie Miller report for POLITICO.

Trump is also set to sign an executive order changing the Department of Defense’s name to the Department of War later today, a senior administration official confirmed. A separate source suggested that the White House is exploring ways to implement the name change without an act of Congress. Paul McLeary, Jack Detsch, Connor O’Brien, and Joe Gould report for POLITICO.

In a pair of whistleblower complaints, two prominent scientists on Wednesday said that they had been removed from National Institutes of Health leadership positions after objecting to the Trump administration’s policies, including efforts to undermine vaccines, evade court orders, withhold research money, and politicize the grant-making process, according to the New York Times. Benjamin Mueller reports.

Trump yesterday expressed support for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, telling leading tech CEOs gathered for dinner at the White House that Kennedy “got some little different ideas” and “we want to listen to all those things.” Ben Johansen reports for POLITICO.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal mortgage fraud investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, U.S. officials say. Brian Schwartz, C. Ryan Barber, and Will Parker report for the Wall Street Journal.

DOJ officials have discussed ways to block transgender individuals from buying guns by leveraging laws that restrict mentally ill people from owning arms in the wake of last week’s Minneapolis shooting, sources say. However, the Justice Department has since assured at least one influential gun rights advocate that it would not be moving forward with the plan, a source adds. Zusha Elinson and C. Ryan Barber report for the Wall Street Journal.

FBI agents seized computers, phones, and a range of documents during their search of the home and office of former national security adviser John Bolton, according to court papers unsealed yesterday. Some of the folders seized by the FBI were labeled “Trump I-IV” and “statements and reflections to allied strikes,” the records suggest. Jeremy Roebuck reports for the Washington Post.

Trump’s pick for the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve’s Board, Stephen Miran, yesterday told the Senate Banking Committee he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his position as the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors while serving out the Fed Governor’s term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. Yun Li reports for CNBC.

Trump is in preliminary stages of exploring ways to take federal control of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, two White House officials suggest. Tyler Pager and Graham Bowley report for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Any Western troops in Ukraine would be legitimate targets for Moscow to attack, especially if they appeared now, Russian President Vladimir Putin said today, adding that he does not “see any sense in their presence” in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday announced that 26 countries had formally committed to providing post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, including through the deployment of troops “by land, sea or air” as part of an international peacekeeping force. Vladimir Soldatkin reports for Reuters; Paul Kirby reports for BBC News.

Sweden’s Transport Agency yesterday issued a statement accusing Russia of being responsible for a significant rise in instances of GPS signal jamming over the Baltic Sea, with the disruption of aviation and shipping communications now being an almost daily occurrence. Aoife Walsh reports for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Trump yesterday told European leaders they are “funding the war” by purchasing Russian oil and must cut Russia off and put economic pressure on China to do the same, according to a White House official. In a press conference after the call, Macron said that if Putin continues to reject peace talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the EU would impose more sanctions in coordination with the United States. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report for Axios.

The Trump administration will not request money to extend security assistance programmes that train and equip armies of Eastern European states bordering Russia, sources say. The spending for the Defense Department programmes is regulated by section 333 of the U.S. Code, and must be approved by Congress. Senate aides estimate that the program currently has a worldwide budget of more than $1bn. The Trump administration has not requested money that would extend the measure beyond the end of September 2026. Amy Mackinnon, Steff Chávez, Abigail Hauslohner, Demetri Sevastopulo, and Henry Foy report for the Financial Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Hamas late on Wednesday expressed readiness for concluding a comprehensive deal to end the Gaza war and release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, after Trump called on the militant group to release all living hostages remaining in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the statement as “spin” and “nothing new.” Adam Rasgon reports for the New York Times.

The death toll of the Israel-Hamas war has passed 64,000 dead, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said yesterday. Separately, an Israeli military spokesperson said yesterday that the Israeli military now controls 40% of Gaza City amid an intensifying offensive. According to local hospitals, Israeli strikes killed 53 people, mostly women and children, overnight into and on Thursday. Wafaa Shurafa, Kareem Chehayeb, and Julia Frankel report for AP News; Steven Scheer and Nidal Al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

The U.S. State Department yesterday announced it is imposing new sanctions on Al Haq, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, three non-governmental organizations that in 2023 asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Israel’s actions in Gaza. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

The United States “told all these countries … if you guys do this [Palestine] recognition stuff it’s all fake, it’s not even real, if you do it you’re going to create problems,” State Secretary Marco Rubio said yesterday. Reuters reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The Lebanese government is running out of time to disarm Hezbollah before risking losing U.S. and Gulf Arab financial support, or a renewed Israeli military campaign, the Trump administration said yesterday. Michael Crowley reports for the New York Times.

The Thai parliament today elected Anutin Charnvirakul as the country’s new prime minister, handing a defeat to the ruling party candidate Chaikasem Nitisiri. Panarat Thepgumpanat and Chayut Setboonsarng report for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Charles McGonigal, a former senior FBI official, “intentionally” compromised a major criminal investigation by tipping off the executives of a Chinese company of their arrests, according to a report released by the FBI Inspector General’s Office yesterday. The new report adds damaging new detail to accusations against McGonigal, who in 2023 pleaded guilty to crimes, including secretly working for a Russian oligarch, and is presently serving a six-year sentence. Tom Winter reports for NBC News; Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

A State Department employee yesterday was sentenced to 48 months in prison for conspiring to collect and transmit national defense information to people who he believed were working with the Chinese government, according to a DOJ press release.

Elias Rodriguez, accused of killing two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, yesterday pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Holmes Lybrand reports for CNN.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is planning to train several hundred armed law enforcement agents to investigate immigration application fraud and arrest those involved, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the agency’s new director, Joe Edlow, the formation of such a team is necessary because ICE does not have the capacity to pursue all cases of immigration fraud. Until now, USCIS was explicitly kept separate from immigration enforcement. Michelle Hackman reports.

The Defense Department has approved the Naval Station Great Lakes base to be used as a staging ground for the Homeland Security Department’s immigration enforcement operations, according to two defense officials. Dan Lamothe and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

The United States and Ecuador are working out the final details of a “safe third country” agreement that would allow the United States to send asylum seekers to Ecuador, a senior State Department official said yesterday. Kylie Atwood reports for CNN.

A federal appeals court yesterday issued a stay to a lower court’s order to end operations indefinitely at the ”Alligator Alcaraz” immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, ruling that it was in the public interest for the facility to continue its operations while proceedings are pending. Mike Schneider reports for AP News.

A different federal appeals court yesterday issued a temporary stay on a district judge’s order imposing restrictions on the activities of National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, pending a detailed hearing on the issue. The appeals court’s order in effect maintains the status quo, as the lower court judge delayed the entry of his order into force to give the administration time to appeal. Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A joint venture between Danish renewable energy giant Orsted and Revolution Wind LLC yesterday filed a lawsuit arguing the Trump administration’s move to halt a nearly finished wind farm off Rhode Island was unlawful and “issued in bad faith.” The Rhode Island and Connecticut Attorneys General indicated they would also file a challenge against the decision. Brad Plumer and Karen Zraick report for the New York Times.

In an emergency filing, the Trump administration yesterday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire the Federal Trade Commission’s Rebecca Slaughter. The dispute will likely lead the Supreme Court to consider the vitality of a 1935 ruling that affirmed the constitutionality of a Congress decision to limit the president’s power to dismiss FTC members to cases of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday filed a lawsuit against Boston, arguing the city’s “sanctuary” policies that limit police cooperation with immigration enforcement officials are unlawful. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

Of course they do. Which you would also know, if you'd read the article, never mind the report.

If you read the article you would have read the paragraph above, which says:

The report also demonstrates that judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK are very rare, and that the Court has only rarely held that the UK government has violated human rights in its immigration-related decisions and policies.

Or even the one above it, which says:

The report shows that reliance on Article 8 in appeals against deportation gained significant attention in media coverage in the first half of 2025. But the possibility of claiming the right to protection of private and family life to prevent deportation is heavily restricted by legislation passed by Parliament...

They are highlighting, correctly, the misrepresentations that immigrants are not being deported because of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, based on the European Convention on Human Rights, rather than the reality that a very small number of immigrants are not being deported because of rulings by UK-based tribunals, applying UK laws - often not even including the Human Rights Act.

To quote the report:

UK immigration law therefore already clearly restricts the application of Article 8 ECHR to the set of circumstances described in [the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002], as set out by Parliament.

i.e. it is misleading to blame the ECHR, and doubly misleading to blame the ECtHR, when the test being applied is a statutory one, separate to the ECHR, passed by Parliament in 2014.

Which you would know, if you read the article or the report.

I'm going to assume you just didn't get around to reading either, and that you weren't deliberately making misrepresentations around human rights and immigration in a thread by some experts calling out people for making misrepresentations around human rights and immigration.

I don't think this article is aimed at them. The report is mostly going through the news reporting in this area, over several months earlier this year, and making a note of all the misrepresentations and errors included.

Obviously if people believe the world is flat telling them they are wrong isn't going to convince them - nor will almost any amount of evidence. At the same time, we shouldn't be listening to what they have to say about anything that relates to the shape of the Earth, because we know it will be based on fundamentally flawed premises.

But a report like this - which helps show why they may believe something that is wrong, what their sources of misinformation are, what lies they are being told - can help us understand where they are coming from and, hopefully, how to fix it (although I'm not sure shutting down the Telegraph is that easy an option).

I constantly see claims that ""if Labour tackle immigration they'll win by a landslide"".

Yet despite them constantly talking about it, they have been going nowhere in the polls. Every time a bit of news comes is released showing a reduction or improvement it is met with cynicism or calls that it is not enough.

I'm not sure what can be done about perception as the mainstream and social media constantly talking about it really warps perspective. We see this with crime, where it is lower now than it was in the past, yet no one seems to believe it.",,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:30.053096

“This ruling is a setback for human rights. “Alligator Alcatraz” is a monument to cruelty and just one of the latest expansions of the Trump administration’s racist, anti-immigrant agenda. “Alligator Alcatraz” should have never existed and since its opening, we’ve been advocating for it to be shut down.

“Beyond the environmental concerns brought in the lawsuit, this facility, carried out in coordination with the state of Florida, is a human rights disaster. The people who have been caged there have gone through hell. Within weeks of starting to detain people, horror stories emerged about dangerous and inhumane conditions including maggot-infested food, overflowing toilets and no working showers, lack of medical care, and virtually no access to lawyers. These conditions are not isolated failures — they are part and parcel of the system designed for cruelty and meant to dehumanize our immigrant friends and neighbors.

“Florida taxpayers are footing the bill for this despicable detention center to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. That money could be going to disaster preparedness or other programs to keep Florida’s communities safe and healthy.

“This federal-state relationship sets a dangerous precedent that invites other states to potentially collaborate with the Trump administration in expanding the reach of his cruel agenda. We’ve already seen this with the likes of “Louisiana Lockup” and “Cornhusker clink” in Nebraska. The very nicknames given to these facilities trivialize the suffering of people who are caught up in President Trump’s cruel agenda. Governors in these states must stop being a player in President Trump’s cruel games.

“Like the rest of President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, expanding immigrant detention centers is a solution in search of a problem. These facilities are as expensive as they are cruel, and do absolutely nothing to keep our communities safe. Our immigrant family members, friends, and neighbors, many of whom came to the U.S. seeking safety and dignity, make our communities stronger and more vibrant. The U.S. government should be meeting them with compassion and support instead of terrorizing entire communities, tearing families apart, and locking them in cages.

“Immigration detention in the U.S. has long been plagued by systemic abuse and a failure to uphold human rights. But President Trump has doubled down and made it his mission to demonize and attack immigrants – he has made cruelty the point. But, he’s out of touch. Recent polling shows that an increasing number of Americans believe his deportation machine has gone too far.

“This ruling is a setback, but we will not stop fighting until the mass detention and deportation machine is dismantled, and immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.”

Trump—who reportedly signed a secret order directing the Pentagon to use military force to combat cartels abroad—said that Tuesday's US strike in international waters killed 11 people. The attack sparked fears of renewed US aggression in a region that has endured well over 100 US interventions over the past 200 years, and against a country that has suffered US meddling since the late 19th century.

""It appears that US forces that were recently sent to the region in an escalatory and provocative manner were under no threat from the boat they attacked,"" Omar cotended. ""There is no conceivable legal justification for this use of force. Unless compelling evidence emerges that they were acting in self-defense, that makes the strike a clear violation of international law.""

Omar continued:

They're now using the failed War on Drugs to justify their egregious violation of international law. The US posture towards the eradication of drugs has caused immeasurable damage across our hemisphere. It has led to massive forced displacement, environmental devastation, violence, and human rights violations. What it has not done is any damage whatsoever to narcotrafficking or to the cartels. It has been a dramatic, profound failure at every level. In Latin America, even right-wing presidents acknowledge this is true.

The congresswoman's remarks came on the same day that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated a pair of Ecuadorean drug gangs as terrorist organizations while visiting the South American nation. This, after Rubio said that US attacks on suspected drug traffickers ""will happen again.""

""Trump and Rubio's apparent solution"" to the failed drug war, said Omar, is ""to make it even more militarized,"" an effort that ""is doomed to fail.""

""Worse, it risks spiraling into the exact type of endless, pointless conflict that Trump supposedly opposes,"" she added.

Trump has already asked the supreme court to overturn the lower court ruling in the tariffs case. Almost certain to follow are Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, his hostile conflict with Harvard University and his deployment of the national guard and marines to Los Angeles. All have been deemed unlawful in lower courts.

“It’s simple: the president and his administration continue to do illegal things at an astonishing pace, and so the courts are finding that these things are illegal,” said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

“The president is committed to pursuing his agenda regardless of whether it’s legal or not, and is seeing what he can get away with.”

The ultimate arbiter of that will be the supreme court, which is stacked 6-3 in favor of conservatives, many of whom Trump has appointed. The court has already dramatically limited the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions to pause Trump administration policies across the country.

That has not stopped them from issuing more targeted blocks. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the fifth US circuit court of appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision that the president had unlawfully invoked the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men he alleged were members of a criminal gang. Its preliminary injunction blocked the administration from removing a group of Venezuelans.

The seldom-used act gives the government expansive powers to detain and deport citizens of hostile foreign nations, but only in times of war, or during an “invasion or predatory incursion”. Circuit judge Leslie Southwick rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had engaged in a “predatory incursion” on US soil.

“This is a critically important decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts,” said Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the Venezuelans.

The Trump administration, however, could ask the entire fifth circuit to rehear the case – and it is expected to eventually reach the supreme court.

Also on Tuesday, a federal judge found that Trump had illegally deployed thousands of military troops to Los Angeles in June, and barred the Pentagon from using national guard members and marines to perform police functions, such as arrests and crowd control.

About 300 troops are still on the streets of Los Angeles and Trump is threatening to send more to other Democratic-led cities, including Chicago and Baltimore. Last month, he deployed the national guard to Washington DC, where he has direct legal control, supposedly to crack down on violent crime, which is at a 30-year low in the city.

The judge’s order, set to take effect on 12 September, condemns Trump’s apparent goal of “creating a national police force with the president as its chief”. It was a victory for the California governor, Gavin Newsom, who sued the administration in June, arguing Trump had violated the 1878 law – the Posse Comitatus Act – prohibiting the use of US military troops in domestic law enforcement.

Newsom called Trump’s actions an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism” and an alarming abuse of power. The administration countered that troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws – but the judge disagreed, ruling the deployment illegal.

A day later, a different federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully terminated about $2.6bn in grants awarded to Harvard University, and ordered it to reverse funding cuts to the prestigious Ivy League school. It marked a major legal victory for the nation’s oldest university. The judge said the administration’s actions constituted illegal retaliation after Harvard refused the White House’s demands to change its policies and governance.

In a separate case, the judge had already barred the administration from halting Harvard’s ability to enrol international students, who comprise about a quarter of its student body.

Just as Trump used the Alien Enemies Act in the context of a wider move to deport millions of people, and used troops on US soil as part of a wider authoritarian crackdown, Harvard was another test case – this time as part of Trump’s effort to leverage federal funding to force ideological changes at American universities.

Each of the cases, Sherman said, attempt to push the boundaries of what’s allowable by “brazenly violating the law”.

“He’s attempting to do things knowing that it’s illegal, knowing it would have to go to court to be challenged,” he said. “It is monumentally stupid.”

But it also presents a significant challenge for individuals and organizations forced to sue, Sherman adds – and for the courts themselves, which must keep up with the volume of lawsuits.

“They are breaking laws that are clearly written and understood, and it’s creating strain on other institutions who are struggling to keep up.”

Now Trump has asked the supreme court to review the tariff defeat after the ruling that he had overstepped his presidential powers when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country. In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that, while US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes.

The ultimate decision on many, if not all, of these cases will probably be made by the supreme court. With its rulings on presidential immunity and other key conservative opinions, Trump has “indications from the supreme court that, despite what the law says, he can do what he wants,” Sherman said.

“That has informed his approach since he’s been back in office,” he added. “He seems to be unencumbered by what the law is and what the law requires.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95ebe248f92ff84bc04801a5e296e346e92c01f/337_176_2417_1934/master/2417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcfe36b3d0ba21fd3da237620281c270",N,,2025-09-05 07:57:11.429080
