The proposed changes better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities.
The proposed changes come as Providence residents demand greater accountability following several concerning incidents this summer involving the Police Department.
The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and National Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.
The proposed CPRA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement.","Tonight, the Providence City Council Committee on Ordinances approved an ordinance amending Section 18 ½ – 4 of the city’s Code of Ordinances, the Community-Police Relations Act (CPRA), to strengthen protections for city residents. The proposed changes better protect Providence residents by expanding prohibitions on participation by Providence Police Department (PPD) personnel in federal immigration enforcement activities. The amendments were advanced to the full city council with a recommendation to pass.

The proposed changes come as Providence residents demand greater accountability following several concerning incidents this summer involving the Police Department. In one such incident, PPD officers were found to have provided “operationally significant” assistance to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel performing a raid in the city as part of President Trump’s dangerous nationwide crackdown on undocumented Americans.

After deep research and community engagement, councilors proposed these amendments to ensure that Providence remains a city where all residents can live and thrive without fear.

The proposed changes fall into five major categories:

Expanding types of prohibited contact between PPD and federal immigration authorities, including ICE

By broadening the legal definition of federal immigration enforcement agencies to include any federal entity tasked with carrying out such activities, the prohibition on cooperation by PPD will include agencies not normally tasked with immigration who have recently been deputized by the Trump administration in order to expand capacity and meet their stated goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The list of prohibited activities will be expanded to include identification verification and translation services, further limiting interactions between municipal and federal law enforcement that could be exploited to harm Providence residents.

The changes would prohibit the Police Department from exercising authority under 287(g) or 103(a)(10) of the Immigration and National Act, which allows municipal law enforcement agencies to be formally deputized and authorized to conduct federal immigration enforcement.

Clarifying prohibited collaboration with federal authorities without a signed judicial warrant

Under the proposed changes, Providence Police will continue to comply with all federally required and lawfully directed actions, as they always have – as long as those directives are accompanied by a valid, signed, criminal judicial warrant. The proposed CPRA changes prohibit police involvement based on civil immigration warrants, an intimidation tool used by federal immigration authorities that carries no legal requirement for compliance by local law enforcement. The amended ordinance clearly lists what exactly is prohibited, including but not limited to:

Providing information to ICE about arrestees that is not available to the public

Using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in the investigation, interrogation, detention, detection, or arrest of anyone for immigration enforcement

Establishing traffic perimeters or otherwise controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement

The amendments also allow for student IDs or any other valid photo IDs to be used as acceptable forms of identification.

Establishing protected spaces within the city

The changes expand the CPRA’s definition of “schools” to include charter schools, city-run preschool and early-learning programs, and daycare and after-school facilities. The ordinance then requires those schools, as well as the courts and non-public parts of the public department, to deny access to their premises if immigration enforcement requests entry without presenting a valid judicial warrant. Defining these protected spaces allows families, and especially youth, to have more confidence about their safety while at school or accessing city services. Providence Police, courthouses, prisons, and jails would also be required to designate a person who can independently verify judicial warrants that are presented by federal authorities.

Limiting collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data

To meet their presidentially directed quotas of resident arrests, federal immigration authorities have been demanding more frequent and more specific private personal data from municipal law enforcement. To limit the harm disclosing this data would cause to Providence communities, the proposed changes would prohibit Providence police from collecting demographic data, such as race or ethnicity, via city-operated surveillance technologies such as Flock cameras and services such as the Real Time Crime Center. They would then require that all current and future partner agencies accessing city-owned data agree via formal written agreement to all of the restrictions set forth in the ordinance, including not sharing any data with federal immigration enforcement absent a judicial warrant.

Allowing organizations to hold the city accountable by suing after alleged violations

The proposed changes establish organizational standing in the private right of action. This would allow certain types of non-government organizations, such as civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations, to file civil action against the city, the department, or an officer if they allege CPRA violations by Providence Police. By intentionally broadening the city’s accountability in cases of alleged violation, councilors are sending a clear message that every Providence resident deserves to have their rights protected – and that violations must be accompanied by consequences.

The amendments will now be presented to the full council at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting on Thursday, October 16 for the first of two required passages, along with the committee’s recommendation to pass.",https://council.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Council-Default-2.png,N,,2025-10-06 22:57:10.442258

But the rhetoric of his top confidantes has grown more extreme in recent days.
His goal, Trump has said, is to specifically target Democrats.
As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear exactly how many federal workers or what federal agencies would be targeted.
“If you look at Soros, he is at the top of everything,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance last month.","President Trump rocked American politics at the outset of his first campaign when he first labeled his rivals as enemies of the American people. But the rhetoric of his top confidantes has grown more extreme in recent days.

Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff, declared over the weekend that “a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country” is fueling a historic national schism, “shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general.”

“The only remedy,” Miller said, “is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

It was a maxim from an unelected presidential advisor who is already unleashing the federal government in unprecedented ways, overseeing the federalization of police forces and a sweeping deportation campaign challenging basic tenets of civil liberty.

Miller’s rhetoric comes amid a federal crackdown on Portland, Ore., where he says the president has unchecked authority to protect federal lives and property — and as another controversial Trump advisor harnesses an ongoing government shutdown as pretext for the mass firing of federal workers.

Russ Vought, the president’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, plays the grim reaper in an AI video shared by the president, featuring him roving Washington for bureaucrats to cut from the deep state during the shutdown.

His goal, Trump has said, is to specifically target Democrats.

As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear exactly how many federal workers or what federal agencies would be targeted.

“We don’t want to see people laid off, but unfortunately, if this shutdown continues layoffs are going to be an unfortunate consequence of that,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt said during a news briefing.

‘A nation of Constitutional law’

Karin Immergut, a federal judge appointed by Trump, said this weekend that the administration’s justification for deploying California National Guard troops in Portland was “simply untethered to the facts.”

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,” Immergut wrote, chiding the Trump administration for attempting to circumvent a prior order from her against a federal deployment to the city.

“This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition,” she added: “This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The administration is expected to appeal the judge’s decision, Leavitt said, while calling the judge’s ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

“We’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this, and we are very confident we will win on the merits of the law,” Leavitt said.

If the courts were to side with the administration, Leavitt said local leaders — most of whom are Democrats — should not be concerned about the possibility of long-term plans to have their cities occupied by the military.

“Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place?” Leavitt said. “They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night and the president, all he is trying to do, is fix it.”

Moments later, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that though he does not believe it is necessary yet, he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act “if courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up.”

“Sure, I’d do that,” Trump said. “We have to make sure that our cities are safe.”

The Insurrection Act gives the president sweeping emergency power to deploy military forces within the United States if the president deems it is needed to quell civil unrest. The last time this occurred was in 1992, when California Gov. Pete Wilson asked President George H.W. Bush to send federal troops to help stop the Los Angeles riots that occurred after police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King.

Subsequent posts from Miller on social media over the weekend escalated the stakes to existential heights, accusing Democrats of allying themselves with “domestic terrorists” seeking to overturn the will of the people reflected in Trump’s election win last year.

On Monday, in an interview with CNN, Miller suggested that the administration would continue working to sidestep Immergut’s orders.

“The administration will abide by the ruling insofar as it affects the covered parties,” he said, “but there are also many options the president has to deploy federal resources under the U.S. military to Portland.”

Other Republicans have used similar rhetoric since the slaying of Charlie Kirk, a conservative youth activist, in Utah last month.

Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.) wrote that posts from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office have reached “the threshold of domestic terrorism,” after the Democratic governor referred to Miller on social media as a fascist. And Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) said Monday that Democrats demanding an extension of healthcare benefits as a condition for reopening the government were equivalent to terrorists.

“I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” Fine told Newsmax, “and what we’ve learned in whether it’s dealing with Muslim terrorists or Democrats, you’ve gotta stand and you’ve gotta do the right thing.”

Investigating donor networks

Republicans’ keenness to label Democrats as terrorists comes two weeks after Trump signed an executive order declaring a left-wing antifascist movement, known as antifa, as a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not exist under U.S. law.

The order, which opened a new front in Trump’s battle against his political foes, also threatened to investigate and prosecute individuals who funded “any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of antifa.”

Leavitt told reporters Monday that the administration is “aggressively” looking into who is financially backing these operations.

Trump has floated the possibility of going after people such as George Soros, a billionaire who has supported many left-leaning causes around the world.

“If you look at Soros, he is at the top of everything,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance last month.

The White House has not yet made public any details about a formal investigation into donors, but Leavitt said the administration’s efforts are underway.

“We will continue to get to the bottom of who is funding these organizations and this organized anarchy against our country and our government,” Leavitt said. “We are committed to uncovering it.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36854e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5846x3069+0+414/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2F1a%2F378d89684f7295b3d0463342b726%2Ftrump-24897.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 21:56:30.533423

What's also not clear is why the agents were trying to detain the man.","New video circulating on social media shows what appears to be federal immigration agents confronting and attempting to detain a person in the West Lawn neighborhood on the Southwest Side of Chicago, prompting questions about why the stop happened and why the individual was let go.

Saturday morning, two men appearing to be U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stopped in the middle of the street, blocking traffic near 63rd and Kostner, and approached a white car. What happened next was all caught on video.

Sam Hassan, owner of Maxcare Auto Shield, recorded cell phone video showing two men grabbing another man from behind a car and taking him to the ground

""The first thing I saw was they were pinning him against the car. Both of the guys were struggling to subdue him and try to take him to the ground,"" Hassan said.

Within seconds, the scene grows louder, with neighbors rushing out, yelling for agents to stop.

""The whole neighborhood came out to support this guy, or to stop what was going on,"" Hassan said.

At one point, the man the agents grabbed appeared to be on all fours and an agent wound up on his back. The man appeared to grab one of the agent's radios and throw it toward a bystander.

Moments later, an agent tried to zip-tie his hands, but the man tossed those away.

""I yelled, 'Let him go,' I mean, because there's certain ways and proper ways of conducting what you're doing, but you're dealing with another human being,"" Hassan said. ""Everything happened so quick, and he looked very scared.""

Hassan said a crowd gathered, shouting for the agents to stop.

The video later shows the agents suddenly release the man before they drive off. It's unclear why they let him go.

""Along the way, in trying to take him into custody they discovered they didn't have the basis to do it – somebody may have been challenging them at the scene,"" said Dr. Arthur Lurigio, a criminology professor at Loyola University.

What prompted the stop is unclear.

Surveillance footage from Hassan's shop shows a white car stopped moments before the struggle. Agents are seen speaking to the driver, then opening the back doors.

Lurigio said it appears possible the agents were not properly trained on how to detain a suspect.

""He wasn't able to subdue the man. He was putting up some resistance, and he was complaining about being grabbed on to, but the guy grabbing on to him didn't know how to get him down, and how steady him and hold him in place,"" Lurigio said.

He also pointed to another problem: one of the agents was dressed in plain clothes, not a uniform.

""He had nothing to identify who he was. Why he was there? Where he was from? That's a mystery. It should never be a mystery if a person's freedom is being taken away from them on the street,"" he said. ""They were trying to grab this man, for whatever reason, and to place him under arrest. That's taking his freedom away. We need to know who's doing that and why.""

What's also not clear is why the agents were trying to detain the man.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi of the University of Chicago's Department of Comparative Human Development was arrested on Oct. 3 and charged with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor, the Cook County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday to Fox News Digital.

Abdelhadi was released from custody after her initial appearance on Saturday.

OVER A DOZEN ARRESTED AT ANTI-ICE PROTESTS IN CHICAGO SUBURB

Court records show her next scheduled hearing is Tuesday.

A university spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdelhadi is an associate professor at the school.

Left-wing agitators have been rallying outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, for weeks. Rioters have blocked ICE vehicles from exiting the facilities, and have been involved in a slew of violent confrontations with police, leading to more than a dozen arrests.

Posts from Abdelhadi's X account show that she was at the rally on Friday. In her last post at 8:52 a.m., she took a photo of a line of Illinois State Police officers, and accused the state of ""enforcing Trump’s agenda of terrorizing our community with abductions.""

She has not posted since.

A day before her arrest, she appeared on a podcast called ""Movement Memos,"" which is affiliated with the far-left publication Truthout. During that interview, she recalled her previous experiences at the riots at the Broadview facility.

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE THROWN TO GROUND DURING CHAOTIC ANTI-ICE PROTEST

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they’re setting up shop,"" she said, referring to federal immigration officials. ""I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community. And so it felt really important to join protesters out there to say, not in our city, not in our name, not in our backyard.""

She later expressed her frustration at centrist liberals.

""There’s no center left,"" she said. ""You’re either resisting or you’re complicit.""

Abdelhadi made headlines earlier this year when she cursed out her employer at a July conference called Socialism 2025.

""F--- the University of Chicago, it’s evil, you know it’s a colonial landlord. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that,"" she said.

However, she reasoned that teaching there was her only chance to have any power.

""Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. That’s possible structural leverage,"" she said.

Socialism 2025 described itself as a ""a four-day conference bringing together thousands of socialists and radical activists from around the country to take part in discussions about social movements, abolition, Marxism, decolonization, working-class history, and the debates and strategies for organizing today.""

The professor spoke on a panel called ""Revolutionary Accompaniment: Holding Each Other When Things Fall Apart.""

According to the Truthout interview, she also organizes with Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at the University of Chicago, and has referred to the war in Gaza as a ""genocide.""

""This is a painful lesson that a lot of us in the Palestine solidarity movement have been learning is that we don’t have power… what we don’t have is power… the question I’m asking myself, and I’m asking you to ask yourself, ‘is where can I actually build power?’"" she said at Socialism 2025.

Even tourists have been drawn into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, startled by the sight of federal agents marching in camouflage last weekend through the upscale city’s Gold Coast, near the famed Magnificent Mile.

What began quietly in Chicago one month ago as a promise by the Trump administration to increase arrests of illegal immigrants is now being felt all over this city of 2.7 million people and in the broader metropolitan area encompassing millions more.

Tensions are flaring up like small, intense wildfires. At elementary schools on the West Side, parents have organized to stand guard at dismissal time. Some construction businesses are keeping their warehouse doors open to keep an eye out for ICE agents. Owners of small businesses are doing their own deliveries, to protect their Latino employees from driving through the city streets.

ICE agents responded with pepper balls and tear gas; the crowd, shouting and waving anti-ICE signs, remained until the federal agents finally left.

Restaurants have cut back hours or stopped making deliveries altogether, unwilling to risk the arrest of their employees.

Reporting from the U.S. Capitol

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said tonight that she's circulating a discussion draft of a plan to reopen the government, one that would include a commitment to Democrats that Congress will address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies.

The draft “suggests that there be a conversation on the ACA extension for the premium tax credits after we reopen government, but there would be a commitment to having that discussion,” she told a small group of reporters.

Collins indicated that she had the document in a folder as she walked off the Senate floor, but she would not show it to reporters.

Collins said she has circulated the draft “selectively,” and that she’s had conversations with both Republicans and Democrats. The senator said the draft would include passing the first package of three full-year appropriations bills, with a commitment to do another package of spending measures soon. Congress needs to pass 12 appropriation bills to fully fund the government.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News that bipartisan huddles forming on the Senate floor last week didn’t happen today. “It feels like we lost the momentum from last week,” she said.

Murkowski agreed with Collins’ approach that Democrats need assurance that ACA subsidies will be addressed — after Democrats deliver the votes needed to reopen the government.

“They need to know that there’s a framework here, and that’s what many of us have been talking about,” Murkowski said. “It’s like, OK, if you vote to open up the government, you know that this is kind of the way that we’re going to move to reconcile some of the things that we’ve been talking about.”

She also criticized the strategy of the Senate voting on the same two stopgap bills, calling it “Groundhog Day here.” The Senate tonight voted for the fifth time on two procedural motions: the House-passed stopgap bill and a Democratic alternative. Both votes failed.

“I think you got to have some understanding by the Democrats that are going to change their vote, that there’s a path here, and they want to know what that path is,” Murkowski said. “And so we got to be talking.”

Sen. Angus King considers opposing GOP funding measure in next vote

, and

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told NBC News tonight that he is considering flipping his vote on the House-passed stopgap bill if Republicans don't address Democratic concerns about Medicaid cuts.

King, who caucuses with the Democrats and has voted in favor of passing the GOP stopgap five times, said he could flip his vote to a no “unless the Republicans are more forthcoming about dealing with the ACA problem,"" referring to the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

“The best we got was last Friday when [Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.] said he was open to conversations. That’s not good enough. We need to deal with this problem,” King said.

Other senators offered mixed reactions tonight after the Senate failed to reopen the government on Day 6 of the shutdown.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who voted with the Republicans to keep the government open in March but has voted against this GOP funding bill, said she sees a “sincere effort” among Republicans to reach a deal.

“There continue to be a lot of bipartisan conversations with people, and I think those will continue,” Shaheen said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had a less optimistic view. “The Republicans won’t talk when the government is open. The Republicans won’t talk when the government is closed. This is just not working,” she said.

Asked whether he’s open to working to reach a deal on health care before the government is reopened, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said, “I think what we need to do is reopen the government right now, not deal with this temper tantrum.”

FAA reports staffing issues at airports as government shutdown continues

The Federal Aviation Administration was experiencing staffing issues or anticipating shortages at airports and other air traffic control facilities in the United States tonight.

Reports of the staffing shortfalls came hours after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that there has been a slight increase in sick calls since the government shutdown began.

No air traffic controllers were expected at the tower at Hollywood Burbank Airport in the Los Angeles area for an hourslong stretch today night because of staffing issues, a source familiar with the situation said.

The FAA’s website showed the staffing issue between 4 p.m. and 9:59 p.m. PT (7 pm. Monday to 12:59 a.m. Tuesday ET).

Trump participates in tele-rally for his pick in tomorrow's Tennessee special election primary

Trump joined a telephone rally tonight for Matt Van Epps, a candidate in tomorrow’s GOP primary to determine the Republican nominee for a December special election for a House seat in a deep-red Tennessee district.

Trump reaffirmed his endorsement for Van Epps on the call, boasting the candidate's résumé as a former Army helicopter pilot who's now a lieutenant colonel in the Tennessee National Guard.

He also said Van Epps supported his “campaign to restore law and order to our cities and towns.” Trump recently established a task force to mobilize the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee.

“Right now, we’re in Memphis. We’re going to Chicago, where you have rampant crime, even though you have a governor that says, ‘everything is wonderful,’” Trump said of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, whose state sued the administration today to prevent the deployment of federalized National Guard troops to Chicago.

Senate again rejects the House-passed GOP funding bill

and

A second vote tonight, to consider the House-passed Republican funding bill, failed in the Senate. That means the shutdown will extend into tomorrow.

The procedural motion failed 52-42. It needed 60 votes to advance. Three Democrats voted for it, and one Republican voted against it. Five senators missed the vote.

When the Senate last voted on the measure, on Friday, three senators in the Democratic caucus — Catherine Cortez Masto, John Fetterman and Angus King — joined Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against it. Those senators voted the same way tonight.

It's the fifth time the Senate has rejected the measure. The so-called clean bill would fund the government through Nov. 21.

Trump weighed in right after the Senate vote, accusing Democrats of shutting down the government while indicating willingness to negotiate with them on health care policies, which Democrats have cited as the reason they rejected the House-passed bill.

""I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Democrats have said they want issues like health care dealt with before they vote to reopen the government.

Senate rejects Democratic funding for the fifth time

and

The Senate voted down a procedural motion to move forward with a Democratic alternative to the House-passed GOP stopgap funding bill.

The measure failed along party lines, 45-50. It needed 60 votes to pass.

This is the fifth time the Senate has rejected the measure.

The vote, had it succeeded, would have started consideration of a bill to fund the government through Oct. 31, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, money to offset Medicaid cuts from Trump's Big Beautiful Bill and funding for lawmaker security.

Hakeem Jeffries says he hasn't 'heard a word' from the White House since last week's meeting

and

Reporting from the U.S. Capitol

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters that neither he nor Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had “heard a word” from the White House since their Oval Office meeting last week.

He said he doesn't know of any Democrat who has spoken to Trump about reopening the government.

“Both House and Senate Democrats are clear, we’ll sit down anytime, anyplace, with anyone from your administration, including the president, to get a resolution here with respect to the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which need to be extended right now, as well as dealing with and addressing the Republican health care crisis that is devastating everyday Americans all across the country,” Jeffries said.

Utah lawmakers pass new GOP-backed congressional map

Utah lawmakers passed new congressional district lines today that seek to protect the state’s all-Republican delegation after a court ordered them to draw a new map ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Under the proposed map, Salt Lake County — the most Democratic part of Utah — would be split into two districts, rather than divided among the current four. Those two districts are expected to still lean Republican, but they could be more competitive for Democrats, while the two others in the state would remain solidly GOP.

The map, which a redistricting committee advanced this morning before the full Legislature passed it as part of special session later in the day, will still need to be signed by GOP Gov. Spence Cox and approved by the district court that demanded new lines.

The court ruled in August that the state must follow a 2018 ballot measure passed by voters, which prohibited gerrymandering; required lawmakers to keep counties, cities and communities of interest together whenever possible; and draw compact districts.

Trump says he would make a deal with Democrats 'if we made the right deal'

and

Trump suggested this afternoon that he would be open to making a deal with Democrats on a funding bill to reopen the government, without specifying under what terms or with what concessions such an agreement could be made.

“We are speaking with the Democrats, and some very good things could happen with respect to health care,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

Asked whether he would be willing to make a deal with Democrats on Affordable Care Act subsidies, Trump responded: ""If we made the right deal, I’d make a deal.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded by discussing health care funding that Democrats have been pushing for, saying, ""Trump’s claim isn’t true — but if he’s finally ready to work with Democrats, we’ll be at the table.""

“If President Trump and Republicans are finally ready to sit down and get something done in healthcare for American families, Democrats will be there — ready to make it happen,"" Schumer added in a statement.

Trump says he will 'look at' Ghislaine Maxwell case after Supreme Court rejected her appeal

Trump said this afternoon that he plans to speak with the Justice Department about the Supreme Court's decision to reject an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein who was convicted on child sex-trafficking charges in 2022.

Asked in the Oval Office whether he would consider a pardon for Maxwell, Trump told reporters: ""I haven’t heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I’d have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look.""

Asked to confirm whether he was considering such an action, Trump responded: ""I wouldn’t consider it or not consider. I don’t know anything about it.""

He also was asked why Maxwell would be considered at all as a candidate for clemency. “I don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I’d have to speak to the DOJ. I’ll look at it.”

Epstein survivors last month urged Trump to rule out a pardon for Maxwell and release documents related to Epstein’s case.

Illinois officials using Trump remarks to generals against him

and

Illinois officials and the lawsuit they filed to block the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard are pointing to Trump's remarks to the military last week to push back against his claim that he's only concerned about crime in the city.

""The federal government has been extremely clear that they’re taking this action not to assist Illinois and local officials but to use Chicago as a training ground for the military to fight what they dub the war from within,"" Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said at a news conference with Gov. JB Pritzker and other elected officials.

The suit brought by Attorney General Kwame Raoul's office refers to the remarks, as well, saying Trump told the military leaders ""they must prioritize 'defending the homeland' against the 'invasion from within' in American cities run by 'radical-left Democrats,' specifically including Chicago. He stated his intention to use our neighborhoods 'as training grounds for our military.'""

In his unusual address to the nation's military leaders last week, Trump said he'd told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military, because we’re going into Chicago very soon. That's a big city with an incompetent governor, stupid governor.”

Pritzker says Trump 'thuggery' making Chicago less safe

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said today he doesn't want the National Guard in his state because the Trump administration's safety efforts to date have made Chicago less safe.

""Our people have been subjected to violence, intimidation and harassment"" since Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection surged federal law enforcement into the city last month, Pritzker told reporters, accusing the government of zip-tying children and targeting people because of the color of their skin, including U.S. citizens.

""They have struck fear in our communities, including notably, fear in the hearts of U.S. citizens. Trump and the thuggery his agents have brought have actively made us less safe,"" Pritzker said.

House Oversight cancels Comey deposition on Epstein

Former FBI Director James Comey is no longer scheduled for a deposition with the House Oversight Committee as part of its Jeffrey Epstein investigation after Comey submitted a letter saying he has no relevant “knowledge and information” about the matter.

In his letter to committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., Comey writes: “At no time during my service at the Department of Justice or the FBI do I recall any information or conversations that related to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”

The letter, provided to NBC News by a spokesperson for the committee, is subject to 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which fines and/or imprisons a person who “knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up” false statements.

The committee withdrew its subpoena and canceled the deposition with Comey, which was originally planned for tomorrow. The committee did the same last week with former Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Andrew Cuomo says electing Zohran Mamdani would be a 'gift' to Trump

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on ABC’s ""The View"" this morning that electing his Democratic primary opponent for New York mayor, Zohran Mamdani, would be a ""gift"" to Trump.

""It's good for Donald Trump because it's the excuse he needs to take over New York, which he has said he will do,"" Cuomo said.

""Going into the midterms, [Trump] will take a picture of Mamdani around the country and say: 'Here’s what happened to the Democrats. They are now communists. They hate the police, they legalized prostitution, legalized drugs,'"" Cuomo warned.

The Mamdani campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Cuomo framed himself instead as the ""last person"" Trump wants as mayor, saying he and Trump ""fought on a daily basis"" during the pandemic.

Trump says trucks to face 25% tariff Nov. 1

Trump said on Truth Social that medium- and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States will be subject to a 25% tariff starting Nov. 1.

Trump had said the tariff would take effect last Wednesday, but that date came and went without the White House's releasing any executive orders to institute the levy.

Mexico, a top-three U.S. trading partner, is the largest exporter of such trucks to the United States.

Trump also planned a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports starting last Wednesday, but the White House said later that it would ""begin preparing"" the tariff on that date, rather than imposing it.

Leavitt denies Trump plans to take over cities with military

During her news briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Trump wants to take over Democratic-led cities with the military or National Guard, saying that Democratic mayors shouldn't be concerned about a long-term military or National Guard presence in their cities.

""You guys are framing this like the president wants to take over the American cities with the military,"" Leavitt said. ""The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities, and we have already seen there’s a positive formula for that.""

Leavitt pointed to the National Guard deployment in Washington as a key example of the crime-fighting effort.

""The murder rate has declined significantly,"" Leavitt said. ""Our streets are safer. People who live here feel safer — all of you in this room, I know you do, you just won’t admit it,"" Leavitt said. ""It’s a proven system that works, and the president wants to make America city safe again. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.""

White House says FBI, Treasury and the intelligence community are investigating antifa

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the briefing that the investigation into the far-left, decentralized antifa movement and the financial backing of it and associated groups is taking place across the administration.

""The FBI is working on it, alongside the White House's Homeland Security Task Force,"" she said. ""We have our intelligence community looking into this as well, and even the secretary of treasury is involved with these matters, since they are financial in nature, and we will continue to get to the bottom of who is funding these organizations in this organized anarchy against our country and our government.""

Leavitt warns that WIC, SNAP will exhaust funds 'very soon'

At the beginning of the briefing, Leavitt warned that if the Senate fails to reopen the government tonight, key federal food assistance programs for low-income households and pregnant women will run out of money.

""The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children will run out of federal money very soon,"" Leavitt said. ""It can be easily fully funded if Democrats simply vote tonight to reopen the government.""

White House says Trump has spoken to GOP leaders in Congress amid shutdown

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has spoken to GOP leaders in Congress amid the ongoing government shutdown.

He's also spoken with the Senate majority leader, who are in touch with, of course, moderate Democrats and Democrats across the board, who we understand, hopefully, want to do the right thing by their constituents to reopen the government.

""So the president is being kept very well apprised of the ongoing shutdown on Capitol Hill,"" Leavitt said.

Trump holds phone call with Brazil's president about tariffs and the economy

Trump held a phone call with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva this morning and discussed the economy, tariffs and trade.

Lula said in a post on X that he asked Trump to lower the steep 40% tariffs on his country and said that Trump appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to negotiate further. He also expressed a willingness to travel to the United States for further talks, Brazil's government said in a statement.

Trump commented on the call in a Truth Social post, writing that ""we will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future.""

Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Brazil in part because of the legal case surrounding his political ally, and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was convicted of an attempted coup last month and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison.

Trump’s presidential library fund is dissolved as a Florida nonprofit for apparent failure to file mandatory report

The Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc. appears to have been administratively dissolved as a Florida state nonprofit corporation last month because it failed to file an annual report with state officials.

According to records on the Florida Department of State website, the dissolution took effect Sept. 26. The fund was first established in Trump’s home state in December.

A lawyer listed as representing the library fund declined to comment. Annual reports are due by the third Friday in September in Florida.

At the federal level, Trump’s presidential library is managed by the National Archives and Records Administration, which does the same for all presidents.

Dissolved business entities are technically “prohibited by statute from engaging in any activities other than those necessary to liquidate its assets and wind up its affairs,” according to the business services firm Wolters Kluwer.

“But despite this prohibition, it is not unusual to see an administratively dissolved business entity continuing to operate as a going concern, because the people who are acting on its behalf are unaware that it has been dissolved,” the firm notes on its website.

Illinois sues the Trump administration over National Guard deployment to Chicago

and

The state of Illinois filed a lawsuit today in an attempt to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the Illinois attorney general’s office wrote in the filing, which names Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll as defendants.

Speaker Johnson rejects Hakeem Jeffries' call for a prime-time debate on the shutdown

and

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rejected House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' call for a prime-time debate on the House floor about the government shutdown.

""My friend Hakeem had his shot,"" Johnson said at a news conference this morning. ""We debated all this on the House floor."" Johnson added that Jeffries, D-N.Y., had previously spoken on the House floor for seven or eight minutes.

""He had all of his colleagues lined up. They gave it their best shot, and they argued, and they stomped their feet and screamed at us and all that,"" he continued. ""And still, we passed the bill in bipartisan fashion and sent it over to the Senate. The House has done its job.""

Jeffries proposed the idea in a letter to Johnson this morning. ""I write to challenge you to a debate on the Floor of the House of Representatives any day this week in primetime, broadcast live to the American people,"" it said.

Johnson said he spoke to the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Patty Murray, D-Wash., two days ago and told her he would agree to moving a package of spending bills on the floor once the shutdown impasse ends.

Treasury secretary and Social Security Administration chiefs to serve in dual roles at IRS

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that he would remain as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and was naming Frank Bisignano as the agency's chief executive officer

Bessent has been acting IRS commissioner since early August, while Bisignano has been the head of the Social Security Administration.

Multiple roles have become the norm in the Trump administration, with Budget Office Director Russell Vought also serving as the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also serving as national security adviser. Stephen Miran, the chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, is currently working as a Federal Reserve governor while on temporary unpaid leave from the White House.

The administration briefly discussed the idea of Bessent serving as Fed chair and Treasury Department chief at the same time, but he is now interviewing other candidates for Fed chair.

The New York City divide shaping its contentious mayoral race

New York City’s mayoral contest has fully surfaced a tension bubbling in city politics for years: the divide between lifelong New Yorkers and young professionals who have recently moved in.

In his 7-point Democratic primary win over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in June, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani cleaned up with younger voters who live in some of New York’s most gentrified neighborhoods — including Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant. Cuomo, meanwhile, edged out Mamdani in majority-Black, outer-borough neighborhoods that have experienced less gentrification, as well as other places like the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, also home to many longtime New Yorkers.

That divide is playing out in the general election, too, where Cuomo is running as a third-party candidate. A CBS News survey last month found that Mamdani held a 51-point edge over Cuomo among voters who have moved to New York within the last 10 years. Among voters who have lived in New York for more than 10 years, Mamdani’s advantage over Cuomo dropped to 19 points.

And among born and raised New Yorkers, Mamdani held a smaller, 7-point advantage over Cuomo. Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, two fixtures of New York politics for decades, combined to win 49% of this demographic.

Leavitt later clarified during an afternoon press briefing today that ""the president was referring to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed as a result of this federal government shutdown.""

Trump looms over Tennessee special election in a deep-red House district

As the special House election for a deep-red congressional district in Tennessee approaches, one issue has shaped the race above all else: Donald Trump.

A crowded field in Tuesday’s GOP primary to fill former Rep. Mark Green’s seat spent months fighting over who’s the most pro-Trump before Trump stepped in with an endorsement for Matt Van Epps at the end of last week. Other issues have fallen to the background, blurring the lines between candidates, while the increasing drumbeat of campaign ads largely revolved around support for Trump and his policies.

Trump and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn each carried the 7th District by about 20 points last year, making the Republican primary the main event in the special election to replace Green, who resigned this year.

But with campaigns expecting much lower turnout than usual because of the irregular election dates, it’s possible the Dec. 2 special general election could be a closer contest than the election was last year, like other special elections around the country this year.

NAACP spends to mobilize Black voters in California redistricting fight and New Jersey and Virginia governors' races

The NAACP will invest $750,000 to mobilize Black voters to cast ballots and monitor the polls ahead of key elections in three states this fall, the group exclusively told NBC News.

The group will spend a quarter-million dollars in California, where a new congressional map that would further boost Democrats is on the ballot, as well as in New Jersey and Virginia, which are hosting governors' races. The nonpartisan NAACP is not endorsing a candidate in New Jersey or Virginia.

In California, the NAACP will seek to reach 1.2 million voters and train at least 300 poll monitors in support of a mid-decade redistricting effort spearheaded by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The California gerrymander comes in response to new GOP-drawn map in Texas, which the NAACP has sued over, calling it “racially motivated.”

In New Jersey, the NAACP plans to reach out to 175,000 voters in Newark, East Orange, Irvington, Trenton, Paterson, and Jersey City, as well as train at least 350 poll monitors ahead of the election between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

In Virginia, the group aims to engage and educate 300,000 voters and recruit 300 poll workers amid a high-profile race for the governor's mansion between Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears.

The White House confirmed the deportations on Monday, saying the individuals had committed serious crimes.

Neither the US nor Eswatini confirmed the nationalities of the individuals who arrived on Monday. However, US-based immigration lawyer Tin Thanh Nguyen said they included three people from Vietnam, one from the Philippines, and one from Cambodia.

Rights groups have condemned the treatment of the first group of deportees sent to Eswatini — which included individuals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba , and Yemen — saying they were kept in solitary confinement and not given access to lawyers.

Nguyen said he was representing two of those who arrived on Monday and two others previously sent to Eswatini, but he remained unable to speak with any of them.

“I cannot call them. I cannot email them. I cannot communicate through local counsel because the Eswatini government blocks all attorney access,” he said in a statement provided to Reuters news agency.

Amid its mass deportation push, the Trump administration has increasingly relied on sending deportees to third countries when they cannot legally send them to their homeland.

Rights advocates have challenged the practice, fearing it can leave those expelled stranded in countries where they do not speak the language and may not be afforded due process.

The Trump administration has also sent “third country” deportees to South Sudan, Ghana, and Rwanda.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the latest group of deportees sent to Eswatini had been convicted of “heinous crimes”, including murder and rape.

“They do not belong in the United States,” Jackson said.

Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump’s use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”

An expanding role for the National Guard not seen before

Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump’s attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Control over a state’s National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor’s objections. Otherwise, it’s up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He’s called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America’s long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America’s cities safer.

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,’” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it’s typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy’s move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it’s more symbolic than helpful.”

Legal challenges set up a clash over Trump’s deployments

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge’s decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it’s the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump’s immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump’s orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump’s opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power.

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That’s our backstop. That’s what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump’s attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge’s weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.

Leaders in California, Illinois and Oregon are fighting to keep federal troops off their city streets, describing the battle in existential terms.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” attorneys for Illinois wrote in the opening lines of a lawsuit today against Trump’s bid to send troops to Chicago.

That dynamic crystallized Saturday in the urgent warning by a Trump-appointed federal judge, not only about an immediate effort by Trump to send troops to Portland, Oregon, but by the implications of the administration’s argument about its legal basis for doing so.

“This is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law,” U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut wrote. “Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Those arguments, she said, effectively boiled down to a limitless proposition: that “the President could send military troops virtually anywhere at any time.”

Immergut’s ruling set off a furious reaction from the White House and its allies, particularly Trump aide Stephen Miller, who cast Immergut’s ruling as an “insurrection” aimed at preventing Trump from stopping an “organized terrorist attack” against federal immigration officials.

“Today’s judicial ruling is one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen,” Miller said on X, describing the protests outside Portland ICE facilities as “a violent armed resistance designed to incapacitate the essential operations of the duly-elected federal government, by force.”

But Immergut emphasized in her ruling that the Trump administration had presented virtually no evidence of an unmanageable assault on federal property or personnel. Rather, the record showed clearly that police had managed the limited unrest, often in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, and had worked to respond when protests occasionally veered into violence.

A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Miller’s commentary, not for the first time, was at odds with the facts presented by the Trump administration itself in court. Far from describing a long-running sinister plot, Justice Department attorneys acknowledged a relatively subdued protester presence in Portland since June. Some spasms of violence — along with a general air of menace facing immigration authorities — justified Trump’s military call-up, they said.

In fact, Miller has frequently taken positions on immigration policy — often as he attacks Democratic-appointed judges — that are at odds with the facts the Justice Department presents in court.

For example, Miller accused U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan of effectively “kidnapping” Guatemalan kids that the Trump administration was trying to reunify with their parents. But the Justice Department told a different federal judge that in fact Miller’s premise was wrong: The Guatemalan government could not locate most of the parents of the kids the administration was trying to deport and that none had sought their return from the United States.

Miller has contended that the deportation of Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia — despite a court order barring him from being sent to his home country — was not an accident, despite numerous acknowledgments by the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Justice Department that Abrego’s deportation was a mistake.

Chief U.S. District Judge David G. Estudillo administered the oath of office. U.S. Attorney Floyd was appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi on September 16, 2025.

“Like many Northwesterners, I first experienced the beauty and outdoor opportunities in Washington while stationed at JBLM in the late 1990’s as part of the legal staff on the base,” said U.S. Attorney Floyd. “In 2009, I was able to make Western Washington my home while continuing my legal service to my country as part of the Army JAG Corps, as an attorney with the Department of Homeland Security, and later as an Immigration Judge with the Department of Justice.”

U.S. Attorney Floyd will lead an office of approximately 85 attorneys and 70 support staff. Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) enforce the criminal laws of the United States by directing investigations and prosecuting cases developed by a network of federal law enforcement agencies. The office also fills a critical role as legal counsel for the United States government in civil litigation and affirmative civil enforcement.

The ruling came Monday during a status conference held in the case of Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man deported in error to El Salvador last March and then returned back to the United States in June to face criminal charges in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said she she felt ""duty bound"" to continue the case given its importance and the fundamental questions it raises about deportation policies.

MORE: Judge denies motion to reopen Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immigration case

The government was prohibited from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, but now seeks to deport him to another country, including possibly Uganda or Eswatini. Judge Xinis has currently banned the government from removing Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys argued that the only reason for detention after there are orders of removal is to effectuate that removal. If there are no current plans for his imminent removal, they argued, then Abrego Garcia should be released from detention. Government attorneys pointed to previous court decisions that indicate they have six months' leeway.

Judge Xinis appeared exasperated Monday with government attorneys who could not answer if there was additional evidence about removal plans to Eswatini beyond letters sent to Abrego Garcia’s lawyers.

“That’s not a tenable position. You’ve either done it or you haven’t,” she said. “It’s not a hard question, guys”

Government attorneys were unable to find anyone who could address the judge's questions about what efforts had been made to remove Abrego Garcia to Eswatini, citing the government shutdown as one possible reason.

The judge gave the government until Wednesday afternoon to file any evidence about steps taken to remove Abrego Garcia to Eswatini. She also asked the government to provide witnesses who can speak firsthand to those efforts.

""I am asking you really basic questions,"" Xinis said. ""What's been done ... have you had any conversations?""

A hearing is scheduled for Friday.

""This case is not just about one man. It is about the integrity of the U.S. Constitution,"" Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, chief of organizing and leadership at the immigration rights group CASA, said at a press conference outside the courthouse prior to the hearing. ""We need to continue to raise collective conscience as we continue to witness the inhumane retaliation by our government to a man and his family who are simply demanding due process.""

Government lawyers had requested a stay of all deadlines related to the case due to the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.

Judge denies motion to reopen Kilmar Abrego Garcia's immigration case

""Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal Defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,"" Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in a court filing.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys had asked that the court deny the government's request, and also, in light of the government's position, to allow Abrego Garcia to be released from detention.

""The mere fact that the Government is seeking to extend all deadlines in this case indefinitely shows that there is no significant likelihood that Petitioner will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. Accordingly, there is no justification for continuing Petitioner's detention,"" his lawyers wrote in a reply.

Abrego Garcia is currently being detained at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Pennsylvania.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the United States from El Salvador in June to face criminal charges of human smuggling in Tennessee. The judge in that case released him into his brother's custody in Maryland. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials then indicated that he could potentially be deported to Uganda and ordered him to report to the ICE field office in Baltimore.

Timeline: Wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador

When Abrego Garcia arrived at the office, he was immediately taken into immigration custody.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers in the Tennessee case have filed a motion to dismiss based on their claim of the prosecution being vindictive. A judge this past week determined that the ""totality of events"" creates a sufficient basis that there was a ""realistic likelihood"" that the government may have acted vindictively and entitles Abrego Garcia to discovery and a hearing on the matter before the court makes a decision on the motion.

A status conference is set for Friday in Nashville.

In a separate immigration court ruling last week, an immigration judge denied Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his original immigration case. His lawyers had argued that his deportation and return to the U.S. had reset the clock on making an asylum claim, but the judge did not agree, closing that potential path to preventing deportation.

Even without AI, the sheer expansion of data collection by DOGE and federal immigration agencies has significant implications.
Social media screening criteria can be broadly interpreted, and intensified surveillance raises concerns about restricting free speech while setting an alarming precedent.","Mass deportations were a central promise of Donald Trump’s campaign, with one spokesperson vowing he would “marshal every federal and state power necessary” to achieve such goals. Since taking office, this has included invoking a wartime act and deploying the National Guard to support immigration raids amid protests in Los Angeles.

Behind the scenes, these efforts rely on the use of data analytics and several technologies. From social media surveillance to facial recognition, the administration is employing a variety of legacy technological tools and databases amassed during previous presidencies. But as the administration’s deportation efforts accelerate, it seems these technologies might streamline its goals and also become more powerful with artificial intelligence (AI).

Tech capabilities in immigration enforcement

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have ushered in technologies that can help power immigration enforcement. Nearing the end of Biden’s term, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported nearly 200 uses of AI across its departments, including approximately 20 active use cases by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These range from verifying information or finding potential errors in a data set through machine learning to routine uses of facial recognition technology. For example, ICE’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which allows people without legal status to live in the U.S. during removal proceedings, rather than be put in a detention facility, requires participants to log their whereabouts through an app called SmartLINK. Usually, this involves people taking a photo of themselves and uploading it to the app, which confirms migrants’ identities through facial recognition and their location at a designated place through GPS coordinates. ICE has also deployed AI for its “Hurricane Scores,” an algorithm designed to assess the likelihood that someone will fail to check in with the agency and to inform officers’ decisions during case reviews.

Other use cases include translation services, facial recognition technologies, and “commercially procured” tools like Babel software, which assists CBP in screening social media accounts to “identify potential threats.”

Technologies have also been deployed at the border itself. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) listed about 60 uses of AI in 2024, including autonomous surveillance towers that can detect and predict migration activity. DHS has also tested robodogs, which would be deployed at the southern border.

The expansion under Trump

These technologies adopted from previous administrations could be repurposed by the Trump administration, including in applications that extend beyond a technology’s original planned use case. Some planned use cases include drug smuggling, human trafficking, and transnational gang activity. The chief operating officer of Geo Group, a private prison firm that sells tracking technology to ICE, confirmed the Trump administration’s intention to monitor millions of individuals in removal proceedings, stating that the company has “assured ICE of our capability to rapidly scale up.”

The administration has already adapted several technology use cases to support its mass deportation efforts, including rebranding the “CBP One” app—which had granted immigration parole to nearly one million people since January 2023. In March, it was relaunched as “CBP Home” to encourage individuals to self-deport.

The administration has also adapted its methods of social media surveillance. Though agencies like the State Department have gathered millions of handles and monitored political discussions online, the Trump administration has been more explicit in who it’s targeting. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new, zero-tolerance “Catch and Revoke” strategy, which uses AI to monitor the public speech of foreign nationals and revoke visas of those who “abuse [the country’s] hospitality.” In a March press conference, Rubio remarked that at least 300 visas, primarily student and visitor visas, had been revoked on the grounds that visitors are engaging in activity contrary to national interest. A State Department cable also announced a new requirement for student visa applicants to set their social media accounts to public—reflecting stricter vetting practices aimed at identifying individuals who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles,” among other criteria.

The Brennan Center for Justice reports that these plans could expand existing programs to collect social media handles from an additional 33 million people. The administration has already begun advancing such proposals—for instance, Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has issued a notice proposing the collection of social media identifiers through immigration forms. The State Department also intends to use these tools not only to identify potential legal violations but to screen for “antisemitic activity” or terrorist sympathies, without clearly defining those terms. This represents just one facet of the data the administration plans to use in its immigration crackdown.

Merging data sets

Although vast amounts of data on both U.S. citizens and noncitizens are already held across federal agencies, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sought to centralize some of this information into a shared repository, following an executive order from Trump calling for the elimination of “information silos.” According to Wired, DOGE intends to integrate data from agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) into USCIS’s “data lake,” which contains information on immigration cases. Additional reports indicate that DOGE and ICE have also requested access to Medicare data to obtain immigrants’ addresses, despite nonresidents being ineligible for the program.

Successive administrations have worked closely with Palantir, a data analytics and technology firm with federal contracts dating back to 2010, to expand the government’s technological capacity for immigration enforcement. Since Trump took office, Palantir has received more than $113 million in federal funds, including $30 million in May to build “ImmigrationOS,” a database system designed to support “selection and apprehension operations” aligned with enforcement priorities, provide “real-time visibility into instances of self-deportation,” and manage logistics across the immigration process. The system is expected to prioritize violent criminals, gang members, and individuals who have overstayed their visas.

The risk of abuses

Criticism of the technologies used by the government to target immigrants has been well documented for years. A key concern with facial recognition, for example, is that it can exacerbate racial disparities in policing and increase the likelihood of misidentifying people of color, largely due to nonrepresentative training data. Some states, such as Illinois, have protections against the collection or use of biometric information through laws like Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, but no comparable protections exist at the federal level. The Trump administration also replaced Biden-era guidance on the use of AI in federal agencies with its own framework, largely maintaining continuity while consolidating “rights”- and “safety”-impacting AI into a single “high-impact” category. Civil liberties advocates argue that this designation is too narrow, excluding processes that still require human oversight despite the risks of “automation bias.”

AI can misclassify individuals’ criminal records, score people based on incomplete information, and introduce other forms of bias in law enforcement. Even without AI, the sheer expansion of data collection by DOGE and federal immigration agencies has significant implications. Privacy advocates warn that programs designed to facilitate the deportation of noncitizens may also affect U.S. citizens, since agencies must gather data on everyone to determine legal status. Facial recognition technologies used by federal law enforcement—including ClearView AI systems that collect and sell publicly available images—have already faced legal challenges in the U.S., France, and the Netherlands. Americans have limited privacy protections, as the country lacks comprehensive federal privacy legislation, and protections are weaker for noncitizens.

Furthermore, while everyone in the U.S. is theoretically entitled to First Amendment protections, noncitizen have been targeted in immigration proceedings for their speech and activism. Because AI may struggle to interpret nuance or context, using online speech as a basis for removal proceedings could have chilling effects on free expression and public discourse nationwide. Social media screening criteria can be broadly interpreted, and intensified surveillance raises concerns about restricting free speech while setting an alarming precedent. Individuals may self-censor, fearing repercussions for peaceful forms of government criticism, such as writing op-eds or participating in campus protests. Some universities have even advised international students to be cautious about their digital footprints.

The prior administration worked to establish voluntary guidance and nonbinding guardrails to promote the responsible and ethical design and deployment of these technologies in government. In the absence of stronger regulations and a national data privacy standard, however, the current administration has created a “wild west” regarding the repurposing and procurement of surveillance tools that support its immigration agenda.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2017-01-25T000000Z_1068917720_RC157D3D0FD0_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MEXICO-1.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-10-06 17:57:46.852624

The large crowd had marched from the federal courthouse to the Capitol for their rally, with signs that read “Hands Off Our Neighbors” and “Gov. Lamont: Immigrant Protections Can’t Wait” and chanting “No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!”

In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, often wearing masks, have detained people across Connecticut, at federal courthouses, carwashes, and from their vehicles.

Many of the speakers at Monday’s rally were faith leaders in Connecticut. Reverend Josh Pawelek of the Unitarian Universalist Society East in Manchester, said that he, along with many advocates at the rally, had worked hard to put protections for immigrants into an updated version of the TRUST Act when lawmakers were in session earlier this year.

“It was infuriating when the bill that we wanted got out of the Judiciary Committee and then just got watered down. And so many of the good things that were in that bill — the things that immigrants needed to be safe in our state — went away in that strange way that laws get made in Connecticut,” Pawelek said.

Pawelek urged those gathered to scan a QR code distributed on flyers through the crowd that would link them to a page to write to lawmakers.

Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, also spoke at the rally. In his district, an August raid by masked ICE agents took place at a Newington car wash. Lesser said the state has the ability to better protect immigrants, but, “we need strong laws that apply equally to anyone who is depriving the civil rights of anyone in this state. Connecticut can play an important role, but we have a choice to make. And I’m hoping we do so soon.”

After the rally ended, Lesser said there are two schools of thought among lawmakers inside the Capitol: “One that Connecticut should take a more confrontational approach, and one that we should keep our heads down.” While Lesser said he understands why some lawmakers favor a more passive approach, “I just don’t think that’s going to work, I don’t think that’s how you stop a bully.”

Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, also spoke at Monday’s rally. She updated the crowd on the case of Victor Sanchez, an activist with Make the Road and HDD, who was detained in September when he arrived to federal court for a routine check-in.

“I have amazing news to share with you all,” Segovia said, announcing that Sanchez had been released from detention. But that news was tempered by the stipulation that Sanchez was given just 30 days to leave the country.

Segovia said her group planned to keep fighting for Sanchez to be able to stay in the U.S. She also read some words in both Spanish and English from Sanchez, who said he was blessed to be a member of the community.

“When I was in detention, I talked to people who didn’t have anything — no documents, prepared in packets, no communities or organizations rallying in support. The reason I am here today is because of all of my community support and the organizing of my community. That people united will never be defeated.”

Segovia told those gathered that lawmakers should act on several concerns the immigrant community has: “We need to protect our personal information from the federal government. Am I right? We need to protect our communities and make sure that our tax dollars are not being spent to assist immigration enforcement in Connecticut.”

Segovia also said that funding should be directed so that no one, regardless of immigration status, loses Medicaid coverage or access to food assistance programs.

Judiciary Committee Co-chair Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said in an interview that lawmakers would continue to look for ways to support immigrants in Connecticut, if given the opportunity during a special session, which must be called by Gov. Ned Lamont. “We’ll continue to try and do what we can to make sure people feel safe in our state, despite the threatening and frankly harassment coming from the federal government,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4934-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:57:50.889695

“Sarkisov’s failure to satisfy these two ‘most critical’ stay factors—likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm—dooms his motion.","Listen to this article

Where a petitioner has moved to stay an immigration judge’s deportation order, that motion should be denied because the petitioner has shown neither a likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable harm.

“An immigration judge issued a final order holding that Arsen Sarkisov, an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, is subject to deportation. Over six years later, Sarkisov moved to reopen his case, but the immigration judge denied that motion. Sarkisov appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which rejected his claim. In 2023, Sarkisov appealed the Board’s decision to our court. At the same time, he asked our court to stay the immigration judge’s deportation order for the duration of the appeal. The United States did not oppose this request for a stay. The case was then paused for almost a year while Sarkisov sought to negotiate a resolution with the government. But the litigation resumed when those efforts failed. Sarkisov’s motion for a stay is now before us.

“The traditional test for a stay governs an alien’s request for a stay of removal pending appeal. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009).

“To satisfy that burden, the applicant must show, among other factors, (1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his underlying appeal and (2) that he will be irreparably injured without a stay. … But these two factors ‘are the most critical.’

“Here, Sarkisov hasn’t met his burden. His two-page motion doesn’t show that he is entitled to a stay under Nken.

“Start with the first factor, likelihood of success on the merits. Far from persuading us that he is likely to succeed, Sarkisov’s stay motion doesn’t say anything at all about the merits. So he can’t establish this factor.

“Second, Sarkisov hasn’t offered a single reason why he would suffer irreparable harm without a stay. He offers only the conclusory assertion that ‘I will suffer irreparable harm if I am removed.’ … But removal from the United States ‘is not categorically irreparable.’ Nken, 556 U.S. at 435. When Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, it repealed a prior statute that prevented aliens who leave the United States from continuing to seek review of their removal orders. … Since litigants like Sarkisov are now free to continue pursuing their appeals from abroad if they are deported while the appeal is pending, ‘the burden of removal alone cannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury.’ … Thus, without any additional arguments showing why his removal during appeal would cause him irreparable harm, Sarkisov can’t satisfy this factor.

“Sarkisov’s failure to satisfy these two ‘most critical’ stay factors—likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm—dooms his motion. … In any event, Sarkisov has also failed to establish that his removal pending appeal would harm the public interest. ‘There is always a public interest in prompt execution of removal orders.’ Nken, 556 U.S. at 436. ‘The continued presence’ in the United States of an alien lawfully determined to be removable ‘permits and prolongs a continuing violation of United States law.’ … Sarkisov hasn’t argued that his case is different.

“To be sure, the government has not opposed Sarkisov’s motion for a stay. But that doesn’t mean that Sarkisov is entitled to relief.

“First, the government’s non-opposition can’t relieve Sarkisov of his burden to satisfy the Nken test.

“What’s more, the government may not effectively compel a court to enter equitable relief by failing to oppose a motion that seeks such relief. A stay pending appeal is an extraordinary remedy that lies within the discretion of the court. Equitable remedies such as stays are ‘never awarded as of right.’ Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Thus, a court must decide for itself whether this remedy is warranted, even though the government does not oppose its issuance.

“Accordingly, the motion for a stay of removal is DENIED.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2025-10-06 20:57:50.796169

Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity to end the state’s policy of denying worker’s compensation to undocumented immigrants who are injured while working.

In a press conference held in advance of oral arguments to the Michigan Supreme Court, which will begin on Wednesday, Anna Hill Galendez, a managing attorney at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said the issues in this case involve basic fairness and worker well-being.

“The reality is, many employers gladly hire workers who don’t have work permits because they can pay them less and get away with more cutting corners on health and safety protections and when workers are inevitably injured, workers compensation insurance companies know they can deny wage loss benefits without challenge,” Galendez said.

John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, noted that this issue has already been addressed in Ohio and Minnesota, where in both states undocumented workers have been guaranteed access to worker’s compensation. The Sugar Law Center is representing the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center alongside FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization focused on issues of corporate agriculture.

“Going to work should not mean having to gamble your health, your livelihood or the ability to care for your family,” Galendez added.

However, this case, first filed in 2021 in the Court of Claims, has become about more than just immigrant rights, argued lawyer David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. The Court of Appeals, overturning a decision from the Court of Claims, ruled in May 2024 that the argument was not timely — thus making Whitmer subject to immunity — because the claim was filed more than one year after the governor’s policy went into effect.

“That would mean that when the governor has a policy of any unconstitutional conduct, including this one, the fact that she got away with it for a year would keep anyone from ever going to court,” Muraskin said.

Phil Mayor, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Michigan, which has filed an amicus brief in the case, shared a similar portrayal of the issue.

“It’s an issue about whether Michiganders, and I mean all Michiganders, can go to court to stop the government from breaking the law, or whether, as the governor would have it, if they’ve gotten away with breaking the law for a year, they can just keep doing it indefinitely,” Mayor said.

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center and its lawyers are aiming to have this case sent back to the Court of Claims by the Supreme Court. Muraskin also noted, however, “she [Gov. Whitmer] could tomorrow choose to stop enforcing this policy and follow the law, and that would resolve this case entirely.”

The flight with the 10 migrants from various locations originated in Louisiana and reached Eswatini earlier Monday, after stops in Puerto Rico, Senegal and Angola, the AP reported, citing officials on the ground and a lawyer for two of the deportees.

The five men deported earlier this year — from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos and Yemen — had various criminal backgrounds and convictions, according to a post from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson at the time.

The Trump administration also recently notified the team of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accidentally deported to El Salvador earlier this year, that immigration authorities were seeking to deport him to Eswatini, according to a DHS spokesperson.

Eswatini is a small kingdom of 1.2 million people bordering South Africa where King Mswati III has ruled with absolute power for almost 40 years. Human Rights Watch says it has reviewed documents that show the U.S. will pay Eswatini $5.1 million as part of a deal to take up to 160 deportees.

In his first months back in office, President Trump’s administration has talked with various countries about taking U.S. deportees, with the administration saying last week it would offer to pay migrant children for self-deportation.

The administration has also enacted an aggressive effort to identify, arrest and deport migrants without legal status in cities across the country, spurring protests outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices.

The Trump administration, in turn, has moved to deploy National Guard troops to some cities, which it says is necessary to protect ICE agents and buildings.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called these protests “domestic terrorism” in a Sunday post on the social platform X.

When reached for comment on the Eswatini deportations, DHS pointed The Hill to the White House.

“The illegal aliens deported to Eswatini have been convicted of heinous crimes which include murder and rape – they do not belong in the United States,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to The Hill on Monday.

“The Trump Administration is fulfilling the President’s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens using all the tools at our disposal.”

JB Pritzker called an “invasion.”

Trump pushed forward with the plan to activate hundreds of National Guard soldiers, including some from Texas, despite monthslong opposition from state and local leaders, as well as objections from civic and business groups in the city.

“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” Pritzker said in a statement Sunday night. “It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops.”

Read more: Over Pritzker’s objections, Trump sending 300 National Guardsmen to Chicago, governor says

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy troops to Illinois to protect federal immigration officers and facilities. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Broadview, a near-west suburb of Chicago, has been the site of several clashes between ICE agents and demonstrators in recent weeks.

But Pritzker, who said Saturday that he refused the Trump administration’s “ultimatum” to activate the National Guard himself, has insisted there is no emergency necessitating guardsmen on the ground. He also warned that White House officials would use any conflict between immigration agents and civilians as a “pretext” for military occupation.

“It will cause only more unrest, including harming social fabric and community relations and increasing the mistrust of police,” the lawsuit said.

The suit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois, names Trump, Noem and Hegseth as defendants.

Texas National Guard also activated

Illinois filed its lawsuit hours after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced he will send 400 guardsmen to cities around the country, including Chicago, and after a federal judge in Oregon blocked National Guard deployments to Portland.

The order is “effective immediately for an initial period of 60 days” and subject to extension, according to the memo, signed by Hegseth. It comes a day after Pritzker confirmed Trump’s intention to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the lawsuit reads. “To guard against this, foundational principles of American law limit the president’s authority to involve the military in domestic affairs. Those bedrock principles are in peril.”

The promised deployment comes as ICE has ramped up activity in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.

There have also been two shootings since the clashes began. On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a “manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.

Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants who have criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens and children with zip ties. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.

The lawsuit also alleges ICE activity in Chicago and its suburbs has already subjected Illinois “to serious and irreparable harm.”

“It also creates economic harm, depressing business activities and tourism that not only hurt Illinoisians but also hurt Illinois’s tax revenue,” the complaint said.

That argument echoes one made by a group of Chicago business and civic groups over the weekend.

“National Guard troops on our streets, like those reportedly being ordered here by the federal government, have the potential to sow fear and chaos, threatening our businesses’ bottom lines and our reputation,” the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago and the Civic Federation said in a joint statement Saturday.

Read the lawsuit here.

Order violates states’ rights

Attorney General Kwame Raoul argues the troop deployment violates Illinois’ rights as sovereign state to carry about its own law enforcement, as well as 1878 Posee Comitatus Act that bans the military from participating in domestic law enforcement.

The lawsuit also claims the Trump administration failed to meet any criteria that could allow the president to federalize the National Guard. The president can federalize the National Guard to stop a foreign invasion, when the president can’t execute the laws of the country or to stop a rebellion.

Raoul and state leaders have argued for weeks that Trump would use protests in Broadview as a “flimsy pretext” to claim a rebellion.

Several protestors have been arrested near the facility in recent weeks on charges of assaulting officers. Federal agents have sprayed tear gas and fired nonlethal ammunition into crowds that have gathered there.

Over the weekend, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman on the city’s Southwest Side in a confrontation with protesters. Prosecutors eventually charged the woman and another protestor with attempting to “assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.” According to the Chicago Sun-Times, agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” and she was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment before she was charged.

Further, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration has entirely manufactured any public safety crisis in Illinois that would require military intervention. It cites a 2013 social media post by Trump, two years before he announced his candidacy for president, that suggested the military should be deployed to Chicago. It lists several other derogatory comments Trump made about the city, state and their leaders over the years, including as president.

Read more: As Trump declares ‘we’re going in,’ Pritzker says ‘terror and cruelty is the point’

The lawsuit argues that animosity culminated last week with Trump claiming during a speech to military generals that there was an “invasion from within” and suggesting cities like Chicago should be used as “training grounds” for the military.

How soldiers will be deployed

The lawsuit includes new details about how federal officials communicated with state leaders and gave Pritzker an ultimatum.

DHS sent a memo to the Illinois National Guard on Sept. 28 stating troops “would integrate with federal law enforcement operations, serving in direct support of federal facility protection, access control, and crowd control.”

On Saturday morning, Illinois National Guard Adjutant General Rodney Boyd received a formal email from the Defense Department National Guard Bureau saying Trump asked for at least 300 soldiers, and if Boyd did not activate them within two hours, Hegseth would federalize them. Boyd responded that Pritzker declined to activate the guard. Defense officials sent a new memo late Saturday saying the guard was federalized.

Illinois National Guard leaders received another memo on Sunday informing them soldiers from Texas would be sent to Chicago beginning Monday.

Abbott, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, has been a frequent foil of Pritzker, bussing thousands of asylum-seeking migrants from the border to Chicago in 2023 and 2024 and criticizing the Illinois governor for welcoming Texas Democratic legislators who fled their state this summer amid a partisan redistricting fight. He said in a social media post that Pritzker “can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let the Texas Guard do it.”

Prior to this year, the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without a request from a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent federal troops to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama without the cooperation of segregationist Gov. George Wallace.

In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.","The Trump administration is considering admitting far fewer refugees into the U.S. this year — as few as 7,500, and mostly white South Africans, officials say — a dramatic new low as the administration is conducting sweeping immigration raids as part of its mass deportation agenda.

The new figures have not been finalized by the Trump administration or officially transmitted in a notification to Congress as required by last week’s deadline, according to two people familiar with the situation who were granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss it with the media.

The decreased numbers of refugees would be a stark departure from the higher figures traditionally allowed into the U.S. — the Biden administration last year set a target of 125,000 refugee admissions.

And advocates warn it would essentially bump from the line those who have already been vetted and are awaiting approvals. It all comes as the Department of Homeland Security is engaged in a crackdown on immigrants in American cities, including this past weekend in Chicago,and recruiting officers with a social media campaign to “recapture our national identity.”

“This would be a monumental shift in U.S. refugee policy, not just in terms of reducing admissions, but also in terms of disproportionately privileging one group over every other,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and chief executive officer of resettlement organization Global Refuge.

“Our concern is that this could turn what has long been a globally responsive humanitarian system into one that overwhelmingly favors a single group,” Vignarajah said.

Trump suspended the refugee program in January

The refugee program — which once had widespread bipartisan support — was suspended on Trump’s first day in office.

Since then only a trickle of refugees have been admitted to the country, either as part of an ongoing court case seeking to resume the program or as part of a new refugee program for Afrikaners that Trump announced in February. The administration says the white South African farmers face discrimination and violence at home, which the country’s government strongly denies.

The White House said the refugee cap is not final until the administration consults with Congress, according to an official granted anonymity because they were unauthorized to discuss the situation.

The official and one of the other people said due to the federal government shutdown, no refugees will be admitted during the new fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, until the government is reopened, although with the program suspended, few are being let in as is.

Some 128,000 refugees have currently been approved for resettlement in the United States and are now stuck in limbo, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency. In addition, 14,000 Jews, Christians and other religious minorities in Iran have long been registered with the refugee program.

“How can a president who claims to stand for religious and American values and who claims to support legal and orderly migration turn his back on so many refugees who followed the rules, while moving white South Africans to the front of the line?” he said.

The expected admissions are lower than advocates hoped

The 7,500 number is a dramatic reduction in the already historically low refugee admission caps that Trump put forward during his first term and also well below what refugee advocates had feared would be the target for the coming fiscal year.

In early- to mid-September, organizations that assist refugees began sounding the alarm that the administration was considering a cap of roughly 30,000, with most of those spots reserved for white South Africans.

Administration officials said at the time that the numbers were in flux and would require White House sign off, but gave no indication that the total number could be slashed by more than 20,000 from what the advocates had feared.

As the government shutdown loomed last week, these officials began to say that no final determination would be made until Congress had been consulted and that that was unlikely until after the shutdown ended.

One senior U.S. official said Saturday such consultation is still required and would not likely occur until the government goes back to work.

But the official also noted that 7,500 admissions in the current fiscal year would be “significantly more” than had been allowed in since Trump took office for the second time in January.

Other refugees may be left in limbo

Certain lawmakers in Congress have been pressing the White House for the official notification, which was required by law by the Sept. 30 deadline.

The ranking Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees that handle immigration matters said the Trump administration is “in open defiance of the law.”

Refugees are being left in “limbo,” wrote Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and other top Democrats on the Judiciary panels in a letter last week. “The consequences are dire.”

They said thousands of people are facing persecution abroad “who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements” are being left to languish in refugee while Trump is “carving out exceptions for white South African farmers, allowing Afrikaners to skip the line.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/border-migrants-15.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:57:55.142892

“What happens when this ramp-up occurs and we have so much more funding going toward immigration detention that it becomes harder to roll back?” This inertia can be seen in the sheer number of immigration detention centers being built—or in some cases, repurposed.","An Indigenous nation of fewer than 1,000 people in South Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe doesn’t often get involved in local politics. But then private contractors showed up to an abandoned airport and started erecting a detention center in the middle of the Everglades. The Miccosukee leapt into action, realizing that the behemoth structure would drastically change the fragile wetlands that they call home.

It didn’t take long for the so-called Alligator Alcatraz to also develop a reputation for egregious human rights abuses. Billed as an immigration detention center for the “most dangerous criminals,” reports started quickly circulating that detainees were experiencing medical neglect and didn’t have access to basic hygiene. More than thirty men were detained in a single cage, with only three toilets to share. Immigration lawyers reported that they could not communicate with their clients, with some detainees even disappearing within the system.

“We found out that Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity were putting together a lawsuit,” says Curtis Esteban Osceola, an attorney and senior policy adviser to the chair of the Miccosukee Tribe. The tribe joined this environmentally focused suit a few weeks later.

While the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had organized a lawsuit that outlined civil rights abuses at Alligator Alcatraz, the environmental lawsuit focused on the ecological impact of the detention center. The groups pointed out that the private contractors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hired to build the facility had started construction without the necessary environmental reviews mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and could jeopardize already endangered species. When the Miccosukee Tribe joined, they added that the barbed wire fences around the facility cut them off from ancient burial grounds, and that the construction had gone ahead without consultation with tribal leaders.

Faced with this evidence, U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams issued a temporary restraining order and then a ruling, which halted construction on the facility, including an immediate shutdown of the sewage and waste management system, which was deemed unfit for use.

“It effectively shuts the facility down because without sewage management and waste receptacles, the facility can’t operate,” Osceola explains.

Since then, Alligator Alcatraz has been steadily dismantled, marking a major blow to one of the Trump Administration’s most hostile experiments in immigration detention. However, Trump’s assault on immigrant communities has continued with an unprecedented number of ICE raids sweeping cities across the nation, forcing families to stay home out of fear of being picked up and becoming a part of the record number of 61,226 people currently in immigration detention across the country.

“People aren’t going to doctors’ appointments,” says Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “When immigration raids happen, they aren’t sending their kids to school.”

Already, communities like the heavily immigrant-populated Boyle Heights in Los Angeles are experiencing the economic fallout of Trump’s raids as shoppers stay home and street vendors and other local businesses lose customers. Even the Las Vegas Strip has experienced a downturn as hospitality workers stay home, citing fears of similar raids.

If Alligator Alcatraz is any indication, local communities and interest groups can come together to challenge Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, bringing together environmental, economic, and local interests to chip away at his deportation machine.

“Local advocates have spent a lot of time preparing for the second Trump Administration, even before he took office,” Bush-Joseph says. In some cases, she explains, this means understanding decision-making hierarchies in local politics and forging relationships with key decision-makers, such as sheriffs and local politicians.

One of the ways that this federal crackdown is being carried out on a local level is through 287(g) agreements, which enable ICE to train and deputize local police forces to carry out immigration enforcement. While these agreements have technically been around since the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has capitalized on them as a means to supercharge immigration enforcement, pressuring jurisdictions across the country to enter into them. Under Trump, the number of these agreements has ballooned from just 135 at the beginning of 2025 to almost 900 by mid-August, with states like Florida and Texas leading the nation in approving such partnerships.

“In the past, these agreements have meant that there are fewer resources for local public safety efforts and that communities will be afraid of reporting crimes to the police,” Bush-Joseph says, citing a 2018 study from the libertarian Cato Institute that found these agreements had no impact on crime statistics. Conversely, they might hinder local law enforcement’s ability to fight crime.

“Opportunity costs might be one of the most important,” Bush-Joseph continues, explaining that along with eroding trust with immigrant communities, a lot of time will be spent on immigration enforcement when it could be spent on other law enforcement needs.

While there are three kinds of 287(g) agreements, the most prominent is the Task Force Model, which enables local police officers to inquire about someone’s immigration status and call ICE during routine enforcement duties.

Since the passage of H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July—which earmarks more than $170 billion for immigration and border control—and the DHS announcement in August of generous signing bonuses for new ICE recruits, a number of sheriffs have spoken out against these agreements, accusing immigration enforcement of betraying partnerships and now poaching their best officers.

Given that these agreements are made on a local level, community members are able to push back at town hall meetings and with local decision-makers—including sheriffs and city council members. While the Trump Administration has made an aggressive push for counties to adopt these agreements, some communities have successfully stopped them from going forward. In Maine, the town of Wells paused its agreement with ICE while the state considers legislation to ban these kinds of contracts. Camden’s police department in Delaware rescinded its agreement with ICE after backlash from residents. Even in Florida’s Key West, residents were able to suspend the program, although it was recently reinstated following pressure from the state attorney general.

“There are so many resources being poured into immigration that we have to ask about inertia,” Bush-Joseph says. “What happens when this ramp-up occurs and we have so much more funding going toward immigration detention that it becomes harder to roll back?”

This inertia can be seen in the sheer number of immigration detention centers being built—or in some cases, repurposed. When Alligator Alcatraz became a legal target, Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis turned his attention to another shuttered facility with plans to reopen as an immigrant detention center outside of Jacksonville, a former state prison now dubbed “Deportation Depot.” An Indiana state complex near the venue for the Indianapolis 500 has been nicknamed the “Speedway Slammer” as it prepares to allocate one-third of its beds to immigrant detainees. A similar facility in Nebraska has been named the “Cornhusker Clink.” Most recently, the Trump Administration opened a tent camp for immigrant detainees at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas, which Trump hopes will someday be the largest immigration detention center in the country.

Some cities—such as Elizabeth, New Jersey—have successfully resisted ICE building prisons in their neighborhoods.

“You have to organize with people,” says Nedia Morsy, the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, who helped mobilize a local push to keep Elizabeth’s Union County Jail from contracting with ICE and other private prisons.

“It’s not like county officials came to us and told us that they were thinking about [contracting with ICE],” she laughs. “We found out because we have a strong base that feels confident in our leadership and shared what they heard swirling around the city.”

By the time Morsy and her team were able to confirm the rumors, the vote to put up a bid for the jail was happening within the next ninety-six hours. Still, the community was able to organize a mass mobilization of more than 200 people that turned out to protest the vote, with thirty people offering testimony at the meeting.

Even then, the vote passed, which allowed the county to advance to the next stage and put the jail up for auction. Instead of backing down, Morsy and her team continued mobilizing to keep the pressure on by organizing meetings and op-eds in the local newspapers, coupled with calls to the county commissioner’s office. “We had an election coming up, so we wanted to make a connection about how important the jail was to the voters,” she says, explaining that the jail is right in the middle of Elizabeth’s downtown. “We also wrote up a legal memo to explain to the county how it was totally feasible for them to edit their bid so that ICE or a federal prison could not be considered.”

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence was the ongoing abuses of detainees being documented at Delaney Hall, another federal immigration detention facility in nearby Newark. During a Congressional visit to Delaney Hall in May, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing. While the charges were eventually dropped, the arrest showed just how brazen ICE could be.

“We leveraged this moment to draw attention to the fact that there are no rules or regulations when it comes to working with ICE,” Morsy explains. The outrage generated support for the mayor and solidarity across the city.

Many local officials started to testify alongside other community members at the monthly meetings, and the tide started to turn. By the time of the next vote, there was broad support for refusing to contract with ICE or any other private prison.

For anyone trying to organize against ICE building or repurposing an existing prison as an immigration detention center, Morsy recommends becoming very clear about the objective.

“Our goal is not just to shut down the Union County Jail or shut down detentions,” she explains. “Our goal is to make it untenable for ICE detentions and ICE jails and ICE camps to operate here.”

That requires understanding the various ways different community members can participate.

“Everybody has a role to play, right?” she says. Some of the more affluent members of the community, for example, have personal relationships with the commissioner.

“For the working class, we have to recognize the power of our testimonies and think about the ways that local communities are impacted by these decisions,” she continues. “We need to get these people in a room with elected officials.”

If there is a structure being built, “you have to look at the land that you’re on,” Osceola suggests, explaining that depending on where you are, there might be different state, federal, or environmental laws that can help make the case. In the case of Alligator Alcatraz, contractors started constructing fences without permits in a fragile ecosystem with no review of the environmental impact.

“Everything was on the record,” he says, noting that these violations were what ultimately swayed the judge in their favor. “The state didn’t do anything. The feds didn’t do anything. They just decided that they were going to build a detention center in the middle of this fragile ecosystem.”

Meanwhile, Morsy recommends keeping an eye on buildings that could be repurposed.

“If you know of any abandoned buildings, you should contact your local elected officials to understand what is happening with them,” she adds. “I can guarantee you that the administration is looking at buildings that can easily be converted into a jail.”",https://progressive.org/downloads/22175/download/EvergladesICEResistance.jpg?cb=9121dcfa4ef8763c841bee4fc187b21f&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 16:58:52.107138

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974.
Since his first successful run for president in 2016, Trump has accused the Justice Department of being infested with “radical left” bureaucrats bent on his destruction.
The White House has seized control of the Justice Department in a way that has not happened in 50 years — and has used it to target Trump’s list of perceived adversaries.
“Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,” Trump said in a speech at the Justice Department in March.","Violating court orders, gutting anti-corruption efforts, imperiling national security and weaponizing law enforcement against the president’s perceived enemies. These are the ways in which Donald Trump and his appointees are destroying the Justice Department, say scores of career employees who were recently pushed out of the DOJ under the president’s second term.

“We believe it’s our duty to sound the alarm about this administration’s degradation of DoJ’s vital work, and its assault on the public servants who do it,” according to an open letter signed by 282 former officials, obtained exclusively by MSNBC.

The collective letter, which was signed by a cross section of former prosecutors, FBI agents, intelligence analysts, immigration judges, civil rights attorneys and others, represents an extraordinary effort by civil servants to publicly call out what they see as Trump’s brazen disregard for constitutional norms and avowed threats of judicial vengeance against those who have crossed him.

All were nonpartisan career officials, not political appointees. Some were fired because they investigated Trump or those who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, violence at the Capitol, while others quietly resigned.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974.

“We call on all Americans — whose safety, prosperity, and rights depend on a strong DOJ – to speak out against its destruction,” they wrote.

The former officials are making the most sweeping and serious accusations against a sitting president since Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace in 1974. The Watergate scandal touched the Justice Department, but the recently departed bureaucrats allege Trump has mounted a much broader and more sustained assault on its independence, policies and personnel.

“This administration’s lies about the ‘deep state’ and exaggerations about government inefficiency have eroded the respect our country once held for public servants,” the letter says. “Demonizing, firing, demoting, involuntarily transferring, and directing employees to violate their ethical duties has already caused an exodus of over 5,000 of us — draining the Department of priceless institutional knowledge and expertise, and impairing its historical success in recruiting top talent.”

The former officials, echoing sentiments expressed privately to MSNBC by other former and current Trump administration officials who have not been willing to go public, added, “We may feel the effects of this for generations.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since his first successful run for president in 2016, Trump has accused the Justice Department of being infested with “radical left” bureaucrats bent on his destruction. His move to fire FBI Director James Comey and pressure the attorneys general in his first administration became part of a special counsel investigation into whether he obstructed justice, though former special counsel Robert Mueller did not reach a conclusion.

Yet, during Trump’s first term, much of the DOJ ran as it always had. Many of the letter’s signatories worked in the department during that time, and most career officials have said they were free to do their jobs as they saw fit.

The second Trump term has been strikingly different. The White House has seized control of the Justice Department in a way that has not happened in 50 years — and has used it to target Trump’s list of perceived adversaries.

“For decades, the guiding tenet for those working at the department was to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,” said Stacey Young, a former Justice Department lawyer and founder of the advocacy group Justice Connection. “Many believe that’s no longer possible. They’re being asked to put loyalty to the President over the Constitution, the rule of law, and their professional ethical obligations.”

The letter will be posted later Monday on the website of Justice Connection.

The president and his supporters say they are merely fulfilling his campaign promises and correcting a historic wrong by shutting down what they call partisan lawfare. The best evidence of that, they say, are two federal felony cases against Trump brought by former special counsel Jack Smith with the help of career FBI agents and prosecutors.

But eight months into his second term — with access to all the texts, emails and phone records preserved from the previous administration — they have yet to produce proof that Biden political appointees influenced those investigations.

“Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice,” Trump said in a speech at the Justice Department in March. “So now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.”

The letter says he has done the opposite. It notes that the Justice Department’s basic mission is “to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights.”

Now, the former officials say, “It’s failing on all three fronts.” They point to what they see as the president’s retaliatory prosecutions of Comey, Smith and others; and accuse the Trump Justice Department of violating court orders, evading due process requirements, directing attorneys to eschew their ethical responsibilities and firing employees without notice or cause.

The letter also says Trump and his attorney general, Pam Bondi, have ousted FBI employees, prosecutors, national security experts and shifted highly trained personnel away from counterintelligence and counterterrorism.

The department also has purged attorneys who enforce environmental laws, driven out 75% of attorneys from the Civil Rights Division; and gutted the teams of prosecutors and FBI agents who investigate public corruption, paving the way for government graft, the letter notes.

“The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other longstanding work the Department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,” the letter adds. “Its plans to eliminate the Tax Division, which saves the country billions of dollars by pursuing tax evaders, will leave us poorer. Cancelling hundreds of millions of dollars in grants has left at-risk communities less protected and crime victims less supported.

All of this, the signers say, is “catastrophic for the nation.”

“We call on Congress to exercise its oversight responsibilities far more vigorously,” the letter says. “Members in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle must provide a meaningful check on the abuses we’re witnessing.”

“Our democracy is only as strong as the rule of law, and the rule of law can’t survive without the principal institution that enforces it.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-donald-trump-pam-bondi-ac-730p-61c925.jpg",N,,2025-10-06 19:57:19.423170

An anonymous DHS official told the news outlet that government lawyers were instructed to put all bond rulings on hold — though DHS publicly denied that claim.
In a 27-page decision issued Sept. 19 and reviewed by Charlottesville Tomorrow, U.S. District Court Judge Leonic Brinkema tore apart the DHS case for detaining Ahmed.
“[Ahmed] prevailed before the [immigration court judge],” the ruling reads.
Ahmed, an asylum seeker residing in Charlottesville, was held in the detention center despite being granted bond by an immigration court judge.","Inside the living quarters at the Immigration Centers of America facility in Farmville, Ahmed felt his mental health begin to unravel.

There was little to do and nowhere to be alone. He shared one open room with dozens of other men. They slept in rows of bunks in one half of the room and ate at dining tables that butted up against a row of fully exposed toilets in the other — close enough that the sight and smell of them were part of every meal.

Outdoor recreation was rare. Long days stretched out before him, followed by even longer nights, filled with the quiet sounds of men sobbing.

“I mentally broke,” Ahmed said.

Ahmed is not his real name. He is an asylum seeker currently living in Charlottesville, who spoke with Charlottesville Tomorrow over a Zoom call with his attorney, and asked to not use his real name for his safety.

“I didn’t have any idea how to live in the jail, I didn’t know how to handle this circumstance,” Ahmed said.

That despair deepened when, like a growing number of immigrants detained recently in the United States, Ahmed was granted bond by an immigration court judge, meaning the judge granted his release until his court date. But the Department of Homeland Security refused to release him.

The decision stunned Ahmed and his attorney.

“The Department of Homeland Security filed what’s called an auto stay provision,” said Elizabeth Schmelzel, Ahmed’s attorney through the Legal Aid Justice Center. “This is authority that they have from a regulation just after Sept. 11, which allows them to refuse to release someone from immigration detention, even when they have been granted bond.”

DHS did not respond to Charlottesville Tomorrow’s request for comment.

The regulation she referred to is 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(i)(2), which says that DHS can “stay… any order of the immigration judge authorizing release” while the agency appeals the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative body for federal immigration laws.

“I have seen it used once in my career,” Schmelzel said. “It is usually used when the department has a very serious security concern. It is now being used blanketly.”

Across the country, immigration attorneys report that DHS is blocking bond releases more often than ever using this broad regulation, which does not require DHS to give a reason for keeping a person in detention. An Aug. 30 report in The Guardian highlighted several cases where immigrants won bond but were still kept in detention. An anonymous DHS official told the news outlet that government lawyers were instructed to put all bond rulings on hold — though DHS publicly denied that claim.

Faced with this incredible circumstance, immigrants and their attorneys are turning to the federal court system. There they file petitions of habeas corpus, a procedure that lets a judge decide whether someone’s detention is lawful. Filing this kind of petition is a drastic step, one that essentially argues that the government is holding someone illegally — in violation of its own Constitution.

And federal court judges are approving these petitions at a striking rate, according to Schmelzel and other immigration attorneys who have spoken publicly.

This was the case with Ahmed.

In a 27-page decision issued Sept. 19 and reviewed by Charlottesville Tomorrow, U.S. District Court Judge Leonic Brinkema tore apart the DHS case for detaining Ahmed.

“[Ahmed] prevailed before the [immigration court judge],” the ruling reads. But under the current rules, government attorneys can still step in and block the judge’s decision on their own. The court blasted this as “patently unfair,” noting that it hands power to prosecutors who already lost their argument in front of a judge.

“The automatic stay imposed in immigration cases constitutes an unequivocal violation of due process. It is, in effect, no process at all,” Brinkema wrote.

Ahmed was released from the Farmville detention center that very day.

“My release is maybe a miracle,” Ahmed said, with a small smile. But the damage, he added, had already been done.

“I’m mentally still in detention,” he said, shifting uneasily as he spoke. “I can’t go out. If I go outside and see people — or police — I feel like they’re coming to arrest me.”

This was not the first time Ahmed has lived in fear, he said.

Ahmed is one of hundreds of thousands of people who seek asylum in the U.S. each year, saying they would face persecution if forced to return home: prison, torture, even death.

He shared with Charlottesville Tomorrow the story of his long journey and what brought him here. Many of the details could not be independently verified, a common challenge in reporting on people fleeing conflict, persecution or unstable governments. What follows is his personal account.

Violence forced Ahmed to flee his home country

Ahmed’s path to the U.S. began with a seemingly small decision. But one that he said set him apart in his home country of Bangladesh.

He wanted to be an artist.

“In my country, some people believe that drawing pictures is a religious sin,” Ahmed said, speaking through an interpreter. “For that reason, since I was a child, I have faced many problems from fundamentalists and extremists.”

He recalls one day, when he was in the seventh grade at an Islamic Study Center, he sketched a human figure on the blackboard.

“Seeing that, the instructor beat me with a long stick,” Ahmed said. “And once the stick was broken, he beat me with his hands and legs. These types of fundamentalists exist in our country.”

But Ahmed wanted to be an artist. And despite resistance from some in his community who he said believed his art was anti-Islamic, he became one. He earned a master’s degree in India, returned to Bangladesh, and soon was selling art and exhibiting in museums across Europe and Asia.

But his artwork made him a target, he said. And, in 2022, Ahmed displayed some artwork near his neighborhood. Soon after, a group of masked individuals surrounded him in the street and beat him. Badly.

“People in my area knew I was doing this kind of work — that I draw pictures and make sculptures,” he said. “That’s why they attacked me.”

By 2024, the situation had worsened.

That summer, the government re-instated a quota system for civil service jobs, which reserved about one-third of all government jobs for family members of people who had fought in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan, Reuters reported. Students in the country protested, saying the quota favored the political party that was in power, the Awami League. Those protests exploded into a nationwide movement.

Authorities responded with force, imposing curfews, deploying security forces to universities, and cutting internet access as street clashes intensified. Weeks of violent clashes left more than 1,000 people dead. By Aug. 5, 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had resigned and fled the country.

Since her ouster, the activities of her political party, the Awami League, have been banned by Bangladesh’s interim government and the party is being investigated for various abuses of power, according to reporting from DW, an international news network based in Germany.

Critics accuse the Awami League of steadily dismantling democratic checks in Bangladesh. Elections were boycotted or tightly controlled. Opposition figures were jailed. Laws limited what people could say online. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk has said that Hasina’s government, along with some Awami League members, committed serious human rights violations. (You can read more from the U.N. and reporting from Reuters.)

But supporters say that same iron grip kept fundamentalist groups at bay. The party took a secular stance and cracked down on Islamist movements. To many Bangladeshis, the Awami League was both a threat to democratic freedoms — and the force keeping extremists from gaining power.

A few days after Hasina’s government fell, a group of men approached him on the street preparing to attack him, Ahmed said. This time, he ran.

“I ran far,” Ahmed said. “Like, 13 kilometers.”

While he was running, some of his attackers went to his family’s home looking for him. Others began sending him threatening text messages, he said.

So Ahmed fled.

“It’s not just me in Bangladesh — lots of actors, artists, writers, models have been forced to flee the country,” he said. “And you will see the houses of many singers and painters have been burned down.”

News outlets, including The Daily Star, the largest English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, are reporting stories of widespread destruction of art, particularly sculptures, in Bangladesh. But groups are also targeting singers and other artists, according to France 24, a Paris-based international news network.

‘I had no option to return back to anywhere’

Ahmed managed to get a Visa to Mexico, his attorney said.

But Mexico did not offer him the safety he sought. The day he arrived in the winter of 2024, he was violently mugged, he said.

He soon connected with a small community of Indian immigrants who told him that people of Indian or Pakistani descent were often targeted, and as a single man alone he was especially vulnerable to being kidnapped for extortion.

So, Ahmed began looking for a way to get to the United States.

His first attempt to simply approach a main border checkpoint on foot failed.

“I tried to talk to a U.S. border guard who could tell me whether I would be allowed to enter because I am going through these circumstances,” he said.

Video of the Immigration Centers of America facility in Farmville recorded in December 2019. Ahmed, an asylum seeker residing in Charlottesville, was held in the detention center despite being granted bond by an immigration court judge. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement

But people on the Mexican side of the gate prevented him from reaching a guard. So, Ahmed said he hired a taxi to drive him back to that same gate.

Instead, that taxi driver took him to a group of smugglers.

Ahmed didn’t know who these people were, but he said they took his money, all his possessions — including his few remaining paintings — and his passport.

The men then dropped him at the border.

“I had no option to return back to anywhere,” he said.

So he said that he simply waited for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to find him.

Once arrested and in ICE custody, Ahmed asked for asylum. It took DHS two days to process Ahmed’s request, set a date for him to appear for his asylum petition and release him on his own recognizance.

Ahmed said he had a friend who lived in Charlottesville, so in January 2025 he made his way here.

A routine ICE check-in resulted in Ahmed’s detention

For the next few months, Ahmed felt himself begin to relax. He made some friends who were studying at the University of Virginia and started looking for local artists to connect with.

“Every weekend, I visited a different type of art gallery to search for some artists. But I just saw some paintings, never the artists. My bad luck,” he said, with a chuckle.

Still, life was finally somewhat stable.

But this peace wouldn’t last.

At his first mandatory ICE check-in in July in Richmond, an official told him he must wear an ankle monitor. They placed it on his left leg, which has some nerve damage, he said. The device, which is large and frequently hot, caused excruciating pain.

He returned to his next ICE check-in with a doctor’s note in hand and asked that it be removed. The official he met with this time would not remove the monitor, but offered to put it on his other leg.

This is where Ahmed’s account diverges from what DHS presented in court.

According to DHS’ court filings, Ahmed “was unwilling to cooperate” and “it was determined that he would remain in custody pending his immigration proceedings.”

Ahmed said he had agreed to ICE’s offer, and while he was waiting for the official to move the monitor to his right leg, three ICE officers entered his room and forcefully arrested him.

“I was not trying to resist them or force them to do anything,” Ahmed said. “I was just asking that they install the ankle monitor on my right leg and let me go. But [the officer] tells me, ‘Your time is up. We gave you a chance and you did not take it.'”

From there, they took Ahmed to a waiting car and shoved him inside, he said.

At the detention center in Farmville, Ahmed’s mental health declined. He found himself experiencing symptoms of intense anxiety and depression. He asked to speak to a mental health counselor. Instead, he said he was sent to a man who instructed him to strategize for what to do once he was deported.

To cope, Ahmed returned to his one true passion in life: art.

He began drawing portraits of his fellow detainees.

“I probably did 100 portraits in two months,” he said. “Every day, I did one, two, three, four portraits.”

The other detainees were thrilled with the gifts, and gave him candies and snacks from the detention center’s commissary.

It’s the only artwork he’s really done since fleeing Bangladesh.

“I had just started my international career,” Ahmed said. “I want to try to build up my career internationally. But, right now, everything is stopped.”

Ahmed is still waiting for the U.S. Immigration Court to hear his asylum case, which is a long and complex legal proceeding.

“When I met [Ahmed], he wasn’t detained, so we were just kind of moving through his trial preparation,” Schmelzel, his attorney, said. “I handle a lot of cases, and my concern now is, because of so many changes in policy, any of my clients could be detained. And if that happens, we will have to stop and do the same thing.”

It took Schmelzel, her team at Legal Aid Justice Center and attorneys from the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights two months of writing motions, petitions and attending court hearings to secure Ahmed’s release.

That’s time she would have liked to have spent preparing for the asylum trial, she said.

“We decided to authorize this body, the Department of Homeland Security, to be prosecutor, jailer and judge with that regulation,” Schmelzel said. “Think about what that really means. It is pretty shocking that the department can just ignore a judge’s order.”",https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-03-at-3.24.57-PM-scaled.png,N,,2025-10-06 17:58:00.368292

They include the fate of fired federal employees, the First Amendment and several executive orders.

Trump has been busy with his marker, signing more than 200 executive actions since returning to office in January. He's far outpacing recent predecessors and his first term.

And that has set another record — lawsuits.

“This is the most intense litigation against the president in recent history,” Ashraf Ahmed, an associate professor at Columbia Law School, told Spectrum News

The Supreme Court is expected to be the final word on many of the lawsuits. It's already allowing White House actions to stand while cases wind through the system.

Among them:

DOGE

The U.S. DOGE Service is the unofficial federal department that unilaterally got rid of more than a quarter of a million federal workers. According to reports, two labor unions are still fighting the Department of Government Efficiency’s ability to receive data from the Social Security Administration.

The court sided with Trump, allowing DOGE access while the case continues.

Advantage: Trump, for now

Birthright citizenship

Constitutional scholars have long argued the 14th Amendment finds those born on U.S. soil are citizens. That is, until the president signed an executive order saying it should not apply to the children of undocumented immigrants.

The Supreme Court still hasn't decided, but it did stop lower courts from issuing a nationwide injunction.

What does that mean? Across the U.S., a lack of clarity.

“What would be my guess, all things considered, will happen? Birthright citizenship will be preserved, but it's going to happen in a much more piecemeal, step-by-step litigation process,” Ahmed said.

Advantage: Unclear

Tariffs

The president has slapped tariffs on scores of countries, calling it a national emergency. But he did it unilaterally, violating the Constitution, a federal appeals court found in August.

The 7-4 decision concluded “the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution.” But it allowed tariffs to remain, at least for now.

If it rules, the Supreme Court would tackle two issues, Ahmed predicted.

“We've had trade deficits for decades. How can it now be a national emergency?” he said. “So that would be one claim.

“And the second would be Congress would never delegate this type of power.”

Advantage: Unclear

Free speech

The Trump administration marked at least two immigrants for deportation for their pro-Palestinian advocacy. It's a test of whether the First Amendment trumps a once-obscure federal law that allows the secretary of state to deport immigrants found to “have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

In a twist, a group of university professors is also suing, claiming that by silencing protesters, the White House denied their First Amendment rights as an audience.

“Now, this might strike some listeners as bizarre who are not familiar with First Amendment law, but this has been on books for decades, which is to say that the First Amendment not only protects our rights as speakers, but in many instances protects our rights as listeners, part of a public sphere, to hear controversial ideas, to be part of public discourse,” Ahmed said.

In late September, a federal judge found citizens and noncitizens have the same free speech rights. But observers say it's, again, unclear how the Supreme Court may rule.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Tariffs_AP_25198293238565_NAT_0723,N,,2025-10-06 15:57:11.841396

Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania.","GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to produce evidence within 48 hours on its efforts to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, this time to the southern African country of Eswatini.

That evidence from the Trump administration is due by Wednesday to Maryland District Court Judge Paula Xinis. She will consider an order to release Abrego Garcia as part of his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention at a U.S.immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

If the Trump administration is making no effort to remove Abrego Garcia, Xinis said the issue then becomes indefinite detainment of an individual, which runs against a Supreme Court ruling that found immigrants can’t be detained longer than six months if they are not in the process of being removed.

Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported to his home country and to a notorious mega-prison before returning him to the United States to face criminal charges, has thrown the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown into the spotlight.

Xinis, nominated by former President Joe Biden, scheduled another hearing Friday, which will be about Abrego Garcia’s possible removal to Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. The African country has aided the Trump administration in accepting third-country removals.

Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn during Monday’s hearing confirmed such a removal is planned at some point by the administration.

Xinis pressed DOJ attorneys on exactly what steps the federal government has taken to send Abrego Garcia to Eswatini.

Guynn said the federal government has not formally started a plan of removal, but said he could not confirm if removal plans were in motion. He argued that there are no imminent plans by the federal government to remove Abrego Garcia and the DOJ is trying to show that by keeping him in ICE custody.

“The government feels like it's in the damned if it does, damned if it doesn't, situation,” Guynn said. “The government has been trying to respond … about concerns that Mr. Abrego Garcia will be rapidly removed from the United States, notwithstanding his habeas case, and ongoing immigration proceedings, and so in an abundance of caution... the United States is not imminently planning to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia.”

Previously the Trump administration planned to deport Abrego Garcia to either Uganda or Eswatini.

DOJ attorneys also asked for a temporary stay in the habeas corpus petition because of the government shutdown.

Xinis denied the stay. She pointed to the DOJ's own shutdown contingency plan, which allows for litigation concerning habeas petitions to continue.

Protests in support of Abrego Garcia

About an hour before Monday’s hearing, the immigrant advocacy group CASA led a rally in front of the courthouse to continue its show of support for Abrego Garcia.

About 100 people led chants shouting, “We are Kilmar!” “No More” and “When we fight, we win!” and held signs in support of Abrego Garcia and criticizing the Trump administration.

Religious leaders said prayers and a few other people spoke, such as Krystal Oriadha, who serves as vice chair of the Prince George’s County Council. Oriadha’s father was born in Kenya and immigrated to the U.S., where he met her mother in college.

“I understand the story of immigration, and it’s one that has been such a story of pride in my life because it’s filled of sacrifice, yes and struggles, but pride and love for your family and hard work,” she said. “It is what every immigrant stands for, not the propaganda that this administration is propping up calling hardworking, loving families criminals, demonizing them. So let’s be careful and mindful of the propaganda that they’re spilling today.”

Tennessee charges

The federal judge in Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Tennessee, in which he is accused of human smuggling of immigrants, on Friday granted Abrego Garcia an evidentiary hearing. It will determine if those charges from the Trump administration are an illegal retaliation after Abrego Garcia successfully brought a suit challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador.

Separately, an immigration judge last week denied Abrego Garcia’s request to reopen his asylum case.

Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. without legal authorization as a teenager in 2011. He tried to open an asylum case in 2019, but was denied because he did not apply within his first year in the U.S., which is the legal deadline for such claims.

The Friday decision from that immigration judge ends one of the efforts for Abrego Garcia’s lawyers to keep him in the U.S., due to his protections from deportation to El Salvador.

A separate immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia those protections from El Salvador in 2019, finding that Abrego Garcia would likely face violence if returned to his home country.

At the time, the federal government didn’t search for a third country to remove Abrego Garcia.

Six-month limit

Monday’s hearing focused on the time frame of Abrego Garcia’s detainment and whether it conflicted with a 2001 Supreme Court case, in which justices ruled immigrants who are not in the process of removal cannot be kept in ICE detention for more than six months.

Xinis questioned the reason for Abrego Garcia’s detention since late August if the Trump administration had no evidence of its plans to remove the longtime Maryland man.

Another DOJ attorney, Bridget K. O’Hickey, said the federal government has not formalized a removal plan for Abrego Garcia, adding that she didn’t know if there were any plans in the process.

Xinis called a short break in the middle of Monday’s hearing to give the DOJ attorneys time to make any calls to get information if the Trump administration was removing him.

DOJ attorney Ernesto H. Molina said he was unable to reach anyone, pointing to the possible furlough of federal workers.

“It just is remarkable to me that you're saying you can't find a soul who can give you, in this case, any additional information,” Xinis said. “That suggests there is none.”

One of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers in the Maryland case, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, argued that if the Trump administration wanted to remove Abrego Garcia, they would send him to Costa Rica, which has already agreed to accept Abrego Garicia as a refugee.

Xinis asked why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.

“We've received no communications, and I can't even wrap my brain to think of a constitutionally permissible reason why they would be fighting over whether to send them across the Atlantic Ocean when they can, this afternoon, send him to Costa Rica,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

Xinis asked the DOJ attorneys if there has been any effort to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, but Molina and O’Hickey said they have not been informed of those efforts.

Human smuggling charges

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia’s criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration was trying to force him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and was ordered released by the federal judge in Tennessee to await his trial there in January on charges he took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States.

In late August, after Abrego Garcia was released from U.S. Marshals Service custody in Tennessee, immigration officials informed him he had to appear in Baltimore before the ICE field office for a check-in appointment. During that appointment, Abrego Garcia was detained.

Xinis has previously ordered the Trump administration cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. while his habeas petition continues, and that he must be kept within 200 miles of the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland. Last month, the Trump administration transferred Abrego Garcia from a facility in Virginia to an ICE detention facility 189 miles away in Pennsylvania.

CHICAGO — In the wake of aggressive immigration enforcement in Chicago, some elected officials and union leaders are calling on the community to help protect immigrant students and their families.

Chicago Public Schools is also reminding families that it doesn’t collect immigration information and that parents should provide emergency contact information to schools.

The messages from CPS, the Chicago Teachers Union, and state and local elected representatives came after a mother and her children, ages 8 and 3, were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at Millennium Park last weekend. Their comments also come after federal agents rappelled onto an apartment building in South Shore on Tuesday, where ICE arrested more than 30 people. Many migrant families have settled in the South Side neighborhood in recent years.

Chicago Public Schools did not say whether South Shore-area schools had planned or offered additional support for their students this week after the raid.

During a press conference Thursday outside of Roosevelt High School in the immigrant-rich neighborhood of Albany Park, teachers and elected officials reported ICE activity and arrests in the neighborhood Wednesday, including near schools. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not confirm whether ICE detained anyone near the school or elsewhere in the neighborhood.

“I am standing here with educators, teachers, school clerks, teachers assistants, social workers and nurses to say that again … They are not welcome to pick up parents and detain them after they drop their children off at our schools. They are not welcome in our neighborhoods to terrorize, to ask for papers,” Stacy Davis Gates, president of the CTU, told reporters.

In a Wednesday letter to CPS families, interim CPS CEO Macquline King said teachers do not ask students or families for immigration status, and CPS does not share student records with ICE or other federal representatives without a court order or consent from the student’s guardian. Her letter also reminded families that schools do not allow federal agents inside without a criminal judicial warrant signed by a federal judge.

Evelyn Gonzalez, a teacher and CTU delegate at Roosevelt, said teachers volunteered to stay late at the building Wednesday for kids who felt safer staying back.

“There were businesses offering refuge in case we needed it, and there were neighbors from our community stepping up to make sure our students were safe walking home,” Gonzalez said. “I hope that we can stand together and that we can care for each other.”

Ald. Rossana Rodriguez, whose ward includes Albany Park, said she closed her office early Wednesday so that she and staff could help monitor school dismissal. Her office and community organizers were able to gather 50 people in about two hours who would help “notify the community” in case ICE agents showed up, she said.

State Sen. Graciela Guzman told reporters that the children and mother arrested at Millennium Park have been released, and the 8-year-old girl went to school Thursday, crediting advocacy from the community. A federal judge ordered that both are protected from deportation for now, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“She went to school today and she played in her playground today,” Guzman said.

""The Democrats can reopen the government at any time,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Monday.","This government shutdown isn’t President Donald Trump’s first rodeo navigating a lapse in government funding — but this time, the focus is less on the White House as all eyes are locked on Congress and its budget impasse.

While the 35-day shutdown during Trump’s first term centered around the president's priorities to fund a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the current shutdown doesn’t pit the White House against the legislative branch.

Rather, there is a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats in Congress over certain healthcare provisions — alleviating pressure on the White House and giving Trump time to post videos showing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a sombrero in an AI-generated clip underscoring Republicans' claims that Democrats want to provide healthcare to illegal immigrants.

Here's What Trump Wants To Do To Reshape The Federal Government During The Shutdown

This paves the way for Trump to remain in the wings during the partial shutdown, and let Democrats take the fall for the consequences, according to libertarian political columnist Kristin Tate.

""By staying relatively quiet right now, President Trump is allowing Democrats to ‘own’ the shutdown,"" Tate said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""The president realizes that if he says anything confrontational right now, the narrative will center around his remarks rather than the Democrats' refusal to support a reasonable spending bill.""

""By maintaining a low profile, Trump is allowing the public to see how the Democrats are acting,"" Tate said. ""The Democrats will ultimately bear most of the political consequences of the shutdown.""

The government entered a partial shutdown Wednesday, amid a stalemate between Senate Republicans and Democrats over a short-term funding bill to keep the government open through Nov. 21. The House had previously passed the temporary spending bill in September.

Three Senate Democrats joined Republicans to vote for the stopgap funding bill Tuesday, but the measure fell short of the required 60 votes needed for passage.

Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have claimed Democrats are seeking to provide health care for illegal immigrants, keeping the government from operating. They cite a provision that would repeal part of Trump’s tax and domestic policy bill — the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" — which scaled back Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens.

But Democrats have said Republicans’ claims are false, and instead, have said they want to permanently extend certain Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to lapse at the end of 2025.

Republicans Erupt Over Shutdown Chaos, Accuse Dems Of Holding Government 'Hostage'

""They say that undocumented people are going to get these credits,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday. ""That is absolutely false. That is one of the big lies that they tell.""

The shutdown differs from the one during Trump’s first term, where Trump and Democrats in Congress sparred about nearly $6 billion in funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall in the spending bill for weeks.

Ultimately, Trump backed off amid mounting pressure to reopen the government so federal employees could resume being paid after weeks of stalled payroll, and signed off on legislation to temporarily reopen the government without the border wall funding.

Matt Wolking, who previously served as the deputy communications director for Trump's 2020 campaign, said that the main difference between this shutdown in comparison to the previous one is that Democrats are the one requesting a policy change — not the White House.

""Trump is as engaged as ever — and using humor effectively, of course — and the biggest difference between now and then is that now it's Democrats who are demanding a specific policy change,"" Wolking said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""They voted against funding the government because they want taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants, and that's why Trump and Republicans are well positioned to win the shutdown messaging battle this time.""

Additionally, Republican strategist Matt Gorman said that Democrats have put themselves in a tough position since they were the ones that voted against the continuing resolution.

""Times have shown over and over through the years that the public supports funding the government. They penalize the party that attaches extra policy priorities to whatever bill does that,"" Gorman, who previously served as the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a Wednesday email to Fox News Digital. ""You're already seeing moderate Democrats splinter off. As this goes on, I expect that to continue.""

Meanwhile, Trump is taking advantage of the shutdown to advance his priorities to whittle down the federal government in an unprecedented move. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget ordered agencies in September to draw up plans for a reduction-in-force in the event of a lapse in appropriations.

Government Shuts Down After Congress Deadlocks On Spending Deal

While federal employees typically are furloughed during government shutdowns, the Trump administration’s plans would permanently scale back the size of the federal workforce if a government shutdown occurs.

""Republicans must use this opportunity of Democrat forced closure to clear out dead wood, waste, and fraud,"" Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday. ""Billions of Dollars can be saved. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Vice President JD Vance has adopted a proactive role carrying the administration’s position, and told reporters Tuesday he predicted the shutdown wouldn’t last long. Specifically, he said that evidence suggests moderate Democrats are ""cracking a little"" because they understand the ""fundamental illogic"" of the shutdown.

Still, he said that layoffs were forthcoming. Trump said Sunday that layoffs were ""taking place right now"" as thousands of workers' jobs remain in jeopardy.

""We're going to have to make things work,"" Vance said. ""And that means that we're going to have to triage some certain things, that means certain people are going to have to get laid off. And we're going to try to make sure that the American people suffer as little as possible from the shutdown.""

The White House said in a statement to Fox News Digital that every shutdown comes with consequences.

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romeo with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

Each day before sunrise, David Huerta checks his rearview mirror for immigration enforcement agents as he drives through the dark to a warehouse in a southwest Chicago suburb. Once he’s clocked in, he peers periodically through the windows on the truck dock, making sure ICE isn’t there. For hours this will go on, as he unloads pallets heavy with sacks of flour and salt, bound for grocery stores nationwide.

When trucks pull into the dock, Huerta readies his forklift to begin unloading the pallets, but first, he must interact with the drivers.

Most are professional while filling out the required paperwork. However, some of the drivers harass him, behavior that has increased since President Trump took office in January.

“The most degrading thing is when the drivers arrive with their MAGA caps and they ask, ‘Hey, when are you going back to Mexico?’ ” said Huerta, who works for a company that makes baking mixes and nutritional powders. “ ‘Soon, don’t worry about it.’ That’s the only answer you give, because you can’t say more, because you don’t know if when you close the door, they’ll make a call and say, ‘Hey, there’s some Mexicans in here.’ ”

Huerta is one of the 68,000 workers in the Chicago region’s food and beverage manufacturing sector, according to a 2023 report from World Business Chicago, an economic development agency. Warehouses operated by some of the nation’s largest food brands accept raw products from farms that are processed and mixed into edible goods, boxed, packaged and shipped to grocery stores and restaurants nationwide.

The labor force of forklift drivers, box packers, mixers and inspectors that has helped turn Chicago into a global logistical hub is largely fueled by immigrants with varying legal statuses.

For decades, those jobs have often been difficult and sometimes unsafe, with undocumented workers having little recourse when their rights were violated. In recent years, worker advocates have said that state and federal policies have made progress in protecting vulnerable immigrants who anchor the region’s growing food logistics industry.

But now, the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies have revived fears that recent gains are unraveling and the stability of the region’s food system will be shaken. Trump has ended deportation deferral programs, increased workplace raids and sued the state of Illinois over some of its labor laws.

Most notably, Trump terminated a Biden-era program called Deferred Action for Labor Enforcement, or DALE, which allowed undocumented workers who spoke out about labor violations to apply for a four-year work permit, essentially removing the threat of deportation.

Huerta was granted a permit through DALE in 2024.

He and dozens of other undocumented temp workers made formal complaints against their employer, a third-party food logistics company with several locations throughout the Chicago area. The workers alleged that management discriminated by giving them heavy or dangerous jobs that the company knew they couldn’t refuse because of their immigration status. As a result, Huerta was granted a temporary work permit and was able to switch jobs.

“It turns out that the mistreatment, the distinction between full-time workers and temp workers is quite significant, because full-time workers are not usually given jobs that are as heavy as those given to agency workers,” Huerta said.

Huerta feels vulnerable, even though he is, for the first time in 26 years, able to work legally in the U.S.

“It’s true that right now, I have my work permit, but it’s the same thing, you’re still undocumented, you’re still the one who has no say,” said Huerta, whose temporary work permit does not provide a path to citizenship.

To better understand how Trump’s immigration policies are reshaping Chicago and its role in the national food system, Investigate Midwest spoke with dozens of warehouse workers, food manufacturers, immigrant advocates, lawmakers and neighborhood leaders.

The increase in workplace raids across the country has made many too afraid to show up for work.

Companies have laid off hundreds of people after Trump revoked some work permit programs. In suburban Schaumburg, more than 500 people were laid off in April from Nestlé USA’s Nation Pizza, the maker of DiGiorno and other popular frozen pizza brands.

The end of DALE underscores a broader shift. Once seen as a tool to encourage workers to come forward about labor violations, its cancellation signals the administration’s possible intent to not investigate workplace violations.

“The climate of uncertainty that has been created here, I think it’s particularly punitive, and it is affecting the food supply chain,” said Nik Theodore, a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois Chicago. “There are wide-ranging impacts here, in very uncertain times.”

Temp work, exploitation and the fight for protections

Even before the first non-Indigenous settlers arrived in the Chicago area, the land between the Upper Mississippi River System and the Great Lakes was a confluence of trade.

Over the past 170 years, the addition of railroads, river ports, major highways and airports has turned Chicago into one of the largest logistics hubs on the continent.

As the region’s manufacturing sector declined in the 1970s, the area leaned into its logistics industry, which became “an economic fix,” according to José Miguel Acosta-Córdova, an economic geographer and historian.

“There was a large area of land available for purchase for development west of the city, and you had eager governments,” Acosta-Córdova said of the collar counties, a five-county region west of Chicago. “There’s the need to move goods efficiently and rapidly around the world, and the need to store those goods as they were moving, right? So then the ’80s and ’90s and onwards, you see this huge logistics boom started happening.”

As massive warehouses were built, thousands of new jobs were created.

Over the last century, America’s agriculture and food production industries — including meatpacking plants, corn fields and industrial animal farms — have increasingly relied on immigrant labor as a way to maintain low pay and substandard working conditions.

With few other options, some of the immigrants who have flocked to jobs at Chicago’s food warehouses told Investigate Midwest they are forced to deal with demanding quotas and unsafe conditions.

“I came to this country with the American dream,” said Ricardo César González-Valentína, a warehouse worker from Mexico City. “But [abuse] begins to take away a piece of your life, of your body. You come here to work, you don’t come to do bad things. When I get to know the warehouses, it’s work that sustains the country, because that’s truly what we do. Contributing our part so that every American, from every country, can be fed. It has to pass through working hands. And those hands are mostly Latinos, from the moment a seed is harvested, from the moment it is planted, it blossoms, and the fruit emerges.”

While roughly 42% of farm workers are undocumented, less is known about how many undocumented people work in food manufacturing because it’s not tracked by a federal agency.

“This is a number that’s kind of difficult to put your finger on,” said Theodore, the UIC professor. “What we do know is that these workers are the backbone of the food system in Illinois and nationwide.”

Even before Trump’s second term, the food supply chain struggled to find enough workers, but in recent months, farms, meatpacking plants and warehouses have reported a rise in labor shortages. The work can be physically demanding and repetitive, and the pay is low. Huerta is paid $18 an hour to drive a forklift all day.

Theodore believes Trump’s mass deportations will worsen the problem.

“Labor markets are not going to just seamlessly adjust without friction,” Theodore said. “I don’t think that there is a waiting workforce that is hoping to be employed by food processing plants. And this applies both to the city of Chicago, the collar counties, the rest of Illinois, and the major food manufacturing belts in Nebraska, in Iowa and elsewhere.”

Many individuals employed in the food distribution and processing industries are hired by temporary staffing agencies that often do not provide a clear pathway to full-time employment. This arrangement creates a “permatemp” workforce that critics say traps people in low-paying and sometimes hazardous jobs for decades.

González-Valentína, the warehouse worker from Mexico City, received a work permit through the DALE program before Trump took office. He described the food logistics company he previously worked for as “a mafia.”

“They fire people every six months. The company won’t let you have seniority because it doesn’t want to give benefits,” he said. “When we were there, they fired people every six months and still had the nerve to hire another 100 people.”

Worker centers in and around Chicago have attempted to advocate for better pay and benefits, increased safety and more job security. But the decks are stacked against temp workers, according to Maria Alfaro, an organizer with Warehouse Workers for Justice.

“If [a higher up] doesn’t like you, they’ll give the harder spots to the people that don’t have status, because they know that they need the job. And if they complain, they can get rid of them,” Alfaro said.

“That’s where people are getting hurt. People are getting hernias. People are getting their hands messed up with rotary tears because of the weight that they have to carry. And some of these people are women, you know, puny women that are carrying 50-pound bags. I don’t know how they do it all day.”

State lawmakers push for worker protections

In recent years, Illinois lawmakers enacted measures enshrining public education rights for children of undocumented parents, approved driver’s licenses for noncitizens, and restricted state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.

Legislators also required employers to notify workers within five business days when federal authorities flag discrepancies in their E-Verify — the voluntary federal system that verifies worker eligibility — or I-9 employment forms. An I-9 audit means that ICE or the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division within ICE may do an on-site investigation of a worksite. A raid is different in that it won’t be announced. The law also prohibits employers from screening job applicants through E-Verify before hiring.

In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state of Illinois, arguing that its state law interferes with immigration enforcement. A federal judge in Chicago dismissed that lawsuit in August.

This past legislative session, lawmakers also nearly passed amendments to the Privacy in the Workplace Act, which would have allowed worker centers and workers, regardless of their immigration status, to sue employers for violating their rights. The proposal was a response to the Trump administration’s funding cuts to federal labor enforcement.

Those funding cuts could put more pressure on states to investigate worker violations, but Illinois is facing its own funding challenges.

“The state is in financial straits,” said State Rep. Edgar Gonzalez, a Chicago Democrat and a co-sponsor of the bill, who said the proposal will be brought back in November. “And we don’t want to impose too much on the attorney general’s office, or anybody who would need to enforce this. Allowing the interested party [to sue] allows them to go through other mechanisms in order to seek remediation.”

One of the most significant improvements for undocumented workers prior to the second Trump administration came with the federal DALE program, which allowed undocumented workers to avoid deportation if they had credible information about a workplace violation.

Before DALE, a complaint could mean losing a job.

“Complaining means they tell you they don’t need you anymore,” said Huerta, the worker from Puebla.

DALE gave labor agencies access to workers and victims when investigating a potential case of child labor violations or a preventable fatality.

“It made doing their work a bit easier,” said Ann Garcia, a senior staff attorney with the National Immigration Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. “Investigators could look into [reports] and not lose out on potential witnesses who otherwise wouldn’t have been there.”

However, Trump ended DALE soon after becoming president, a move first reported by Bloomberg Law.

Although only about 7,700 people had been granted DALE status by late 2024 (a fraction of the undocumented workforce), its end has had a ripple effect: Worker centers and community groups told Bloomberg they stopped filing applications altogether, fearing immigration authorities could use the personal information.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processed DALE applications, did not respond to questions from Investigate Midwest.

“Unfortunately, we’re kind of back to a situation today where neither of these agencies can do their work adequately,” Garcia said. “There’s really no possibility at this point of getting this kind of relief.”

Garcia believes DALE could make a comeback, though, with the next administration in 2029.

“I am hopeful that if we get a change in an administration that’s more positive, then we might be able to pick up from where we left off,” she said. “We were just getting started building trust and getting the word out.”

Fear of ICE shapes life inside Chicago’s warehouses

For many warehouse workers, the greatest fear is an ICE raid.

Chicago has been a focal point for the Department of Homeland Security, but federal agents have focused mostly on street arrests, using traffic checkpoints or entering public parks.

Workplace raids have been rare, but there’s worry from both employers and employees.

Some workers, who did not want their names published for fear of deportation, said they worry each time they leave for work. “I think we all worry about whether we’re going to come back or not,” said a mother of two from Mexico.

Brenda Palomares, a worker from the Mexican state of Guerrero, said the fear in her community reminds her of the shelter-in-place rules during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think that this year, this year in particular, will be a year that no one will ever forget,” Palomares said. “It will go down in history, just like the pandemic. Right now, we’re in another pandemic, but it’s Trump’s pandemic, because they are tearing so many families apart.”

Since Trump took office, several food processing and warehouse businesses have reached out to local worker centers to ask how they should handle a raid.

“We’re normally training workers and fighting the boss, but now we’re helping to train bosses how (to) protect your workers,” said Shelly Ruzicka, communications and finance director for ARISE, an advocacy group for temporary workers.

Kevin Amaro from Illinois Workers in Action, a Chicago-based worker center, said that preparing for an ICE raid is a lot like conducting a fire drill. It involves educating management about what their rights are and what to do if ICE comes to their facility, because “a lot of employers are scared, too.”

“We have a checklist…we really work with companies to strategize and figure out this plan,” Amaro said. “ I mean real training, not just ‘here’s a 10-minute talk. Here’s a flyer.’ Great. You ready? No, like an actual in-depth, 40 minutes or more, check-in and plan.”

He emphasized the importance of not volunteering information beyond what’s legally required, and understanding the difference between audits, E-Verify checks and raids.

“There’s rights for everyone,” he said, “no matter your immigration status.”

The lawsuit filed Monday by Illinois and Chicago alleges Trump’s authorization Saturday to deploy 300 troops to the Windy City is “unlawful and dangerous.”

Trump continues to flex federal power and claims the troops are needed to protect federal buildings during immigration enforcement efforts.

But a federal judge Sunday told Trump he couldn’t send troops to Oregon — hours after that state’s governor said 101 California National Guard members already had arrived Saturday with more on the way and headed to Portland.

Sending the National Guard to states despite their governor’s objections is not a new idea in Trump’s inner circle.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in November 2023 that a second Trump administration would order the Guard in sympathetic Republican-led states to Democrat-run states that refuse to cooperate with his drive for mass deportations.

“The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia. And if you’re going to go into an unfriendly state like Maryland, well, there would just be Virginia doing the arrest in Maryland, right, very close, very nearby,” Miller said at the time on “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand with federal law enforcement activity in Portland, Chicago and elsewhere:

Trump’s efforts meet pushback

The lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago comes after Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said some 300 of the state’s guard troops were to be federalized and deployed to the nation’s third-largest city, along with 400 others from Texas.

The ACLU of Illinois also filed suit Monday against Trump, DHS, ICE, Border Patrol and several of these agencies’ national and local leaders, accusing them of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of protests outside an ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois.

At the facility, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago, federal agents have repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls and other projectiles toward crowds in response and at least seven people have faced federal charges after being arrested in those clashes.

Filed by a coalition of news outlets, media associations and protesters — including the Illinois Press Association, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Headline Club — the lawsuit alleges federal agents used “indiscriminate” and “violent force,” including tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper balls and flash grenades, interfering with First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and press.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint says.

Latest federal deployments target Portland, Chicago

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed that the president authorized using the Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called “ongoing violent riots and lawlessness” that local leaders have not quelled.

Trump has characterized both Portland and Chicago as cities rife with crime and unrest, calling the former a “war zone” and suggesting apocalyptic force was needed to quell problems in the latter. Since the start of his second term, he has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore, Maryland; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek talked to Trump in late September and said the deployment was unnecessary. She refused to call up any Oregon National Guard troops, so Trump did so himself in an order to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. That prompted the lawsuit from city and state officials.

In Chicago, alarms raised about racial profiling

On Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order barring federal agents from using city-owned property as staging areas. It applies to parking lots, garages and vacant lots.

“We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority,” Johnson said in a statement.

The sight of armed, camouflaged and masked Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous downtown landmarks has amplified concerns about racial profiling. Many Chicagoans were already uneasy after an immigration crackdown began earlier this month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged that federal agents shot a woman Saturday morning on the southwest side of Chicago. A statement from the department said it happened after Border Patrol agents patrolling the area “were rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

“The officers exited their trapped vehicle, when a suspect tried to run them over, forcing the officers to fire defensively,” the statement said.

No law enforcement officers were seriously injured, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

The woman who was shot was a U.S. citizen and was armed with a semiautomatic weapon, according to McLaughlin.

The woman was in fair condition at a hospital, according to fire officials.

Deployment in Portland blocked by judge

About 400 protesters marched Saturday from a park to a Portland ICE detention facility. Federal agents used chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls, the Oregonian reported.

At least six people were arrested as the group reached the facility.

Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut later issued her first ruling temporarily blocking the deployment on Saturday afternoon, saying the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing that the deployment could harm Oregon’s state sovereignty.

The Trump administration responded with another attempt to send in National Guard troops from California and Texas, prompting Kotek and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, to go back to court Sunday. Immergut granted the request, blocking any National Guard troops from being sent to Oregon for 14 days.

Efforts in Memphis and Louisiana

On Wednesday, Hegseth, Bondi and Miller rallied members of a federal law enforcement task force that began operating in Memphis as part of Trump’s crime-fighting plan. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has supported the effort.

On Sept. 30, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry asked for a guard deployment to New Orleans and other cities to help fight crime.

He said there has been “elevated violent crime rates” in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, as well as shortages in local law enforcement.

Appellate court weighs California deployment

Trump deployed guard soldiers and active duty Marines in Los Angeles during the summer over the objections of Gov. Newsom, who sued and won a temporary block after a federal judge found the president’s use of the guard was likely unlawful.

The Trump administration appealed, and the block was put on hold by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate case is still underway, but the panel has indicated that it believes the administration is likely to prevail.

“One moment the phone is yours, and the next minute its data is streaming to an attacker,” he said.
On Friday, the administration deported award-winning journalist Mario Guevara for livestreaming law enforcement activities, which is protected by the First Amendment.","Today, federal lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) demanding information on any plans Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has to use Graphite, a spyware program that can access — without the owner’s knowledge or consent — a phone’s location data, photos, and encrypted applications, including WhatsApp and Signal.

Last year, the Biden administration paused the contract with Paragon Solutions, which operates Graphite, while it conducted a review to ensure it complied with an executive order issued in 2023 which limits the government’s use of spyware. In August, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, news that was first reported by All-Source Intelligence.

The letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was signed by Democratic Reps. Summer Lee (Pennsylvania), Shontel Brown (Ohio), and Yassamin Ansari (Arizona).

The lawmakers asked Noem to provide information on the government’s use of surveillance technology by October 14, including “a comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE’s strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States.”

The lawmakers warned that allowing ICE to use to spyware “threatens Americans’ freedom of movement and freedom of speech.”

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” they wrote.

Paragon was founded in 2019 by former Israeli military intelligence officers who worked in the Israeli military’s Unit 8200. Last year, the Florida-based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, bought Paragon.

Recently, Microsoft blocked Unit 8200’s access to its cloud software after an investigation published in The Guardian revealed that the unit was using the cloud to store information on Palestinians — information that was then used to plan deadly attacks on Gaza.

Paragon has been repeatedly accused of violating people’s human rights. Earlier this year, the company was embroiled in a scandal after investigations revealed that the software had been used to spy on activists and journalists in Europe.

“There’s no link to click, attachment to download, file to open or mistake to make,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, told the Associated Press of Graphite. “One moment the phone is yours, and the next minute its data is streaming to an attacker,” he said.

Researchers with The Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto, conducted a forensic analysis of two reporters’ phones — “a prominent European journalist” who asked to remain anonymous, and Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino. Both journalists’ phones were targeted with Graphite, according to the researchers’ report released in June.

Amnesty International says Graphite “can never be human rights compliant and should be banned.”

“Paragon’s Graphite spyware product is a form of highly invasive spyware capable of covertly accessing the most intimate and sensitive data on an individual’s phone, and cannot be independently audited,” the group said in March.

The letter to Noem comes as the Trump administration has targeted anyone it perceives as an enemy, including pro-Palestine activists, anti-ICE protesters, and Democratic elected officials. On Friday, the administration deported award-winning journalist Mario Guevara for livestreaming law enforcement activities, which is protected by the First Amendment.

In comments to Truthout on Monday, Lee said that she will “not allow ICE to operate in the shadows.”

“Once that kind of surveillance is allowed, it rarely stays limited to whatever the government claims it is for,” she said. “History shows what happens when governments are given this kind of unchecked access. It leads to intimidation, to silence, to control. And too often, it is immigrants, organizers, and people speaking out for justice who feel it first. Our responsibility is to protect civil liberties, not surrender them.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2149375706-1536x1097.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 14:57:54.412446

Fire destroys home of South Carolina judge who had received death threats

Edward Helmore

The cause of a huge fire at the beachfront home of a South Carolina judge who had reportedly been subjected to death threats is being investigated by state law enforcement investigators.

The blaze at the home of Diane Goodstein – a Democrat-appointed circuit court judge – erupted on Saturday, sending three members of her family to the hospital, including her husband, a former state senator.

However, Goodstein, 69, was walking her dogs at the time the blaze erupted at the three-story home in the luxury gated community on Edisto Beach in Colleton county.

A spokesperson for the South Carolina state law enforcement division (Sled) confirmed it was investigating a fire in the county. “The investigation is active and ongoing. More information may be available as the investigation continues,” a Sled spokesperson told FITSNews.

For his part, John Kittredge, the South Carolina chief justice, told the outlet: “At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Sled chief Mark Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security.”

Goodstein, who has served on the state judicial bench since 1989, in September issued a temporary injunction on the release of the state’s voter files to the Trump administration-led US justice department.

Goodstein’s ruling was later publicly criticized by an assistant attorney general for the justice department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon. The division has been at the forefront of efforts to acquire information, including names, addresses, driver’s license numbers and social security numbers, of more than 3 million registered voters under an executive order targeting “non-citizen voter registration”.

During her press briefing, Leavitt also claimed that the Democratic funding proposal would “require Medicaid to pay more for emergency care provided to illegal aliens than it does for American patients who are disabled, elderly or children”.

This statement is not true, mainly because emergency Medicaid is a way for hospitals to get reimbursement for providing care for any patient, regardless of immigration status, as required under federal law. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by the president earlier this year, cut those federal dollars, and Democrats are seeking to reverse that through their funding extension.

What’s more, according to a recent analysis by KFF, emergency Medicaid spending accounted for less than 1% of the program’s total expenditure between 2017-2023.

White House reaffirms that layoffs will be an 'unfortunate consequence' of government shutdown, blames Democratic lawmakers

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the layoffs that the president has telegraphed will be an “unfortunate consequence” of the government shutdown – of which the administration continues to blame Democratic members of congress.

“This conversation about layoffs would not be happening right now if the Democrats did not vote to shut the government down,” Leavitt said.

The administration, including Russ Vought, who leads the Office of Management and Budget, has said that the sweeping reductions-in-force (RIFs) would come as a byproduct of the government shutdown if Trump feels that negotiations to pass a funding extension remain at a standstill.

The Senate will reconvene later today, where the dueling stopgap bills are poised to be rejected again. “We hope that the vote will not fail, because this administration wants to reopen the government. We don’t want to see people laid off,” Leavitt added.

Leavitt calls Trump-appointed judge 'untethered in reality' following national guard ruling

Karoline Leavitt said that the ruling from Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointed federal judge, was “untethered in reality”.

Immergut temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any national guard units to Oregon, saying that there was no evidence that recent protests necessitated the presence of national guard troops.

Leavitt said that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Portland has been “really under siege by these anarchists”.

“They have been disrespecting law enforcement. They’ve been inciting violence,” she added. “We are appealing that decision, as you know, we expect a hearing on it pretty quickly, and we’re very confident in the president’s legal authority to do this.”

Leavitt went on to criticize Democratic leaders throughout the country, like JB Pritzker and Gavin Newsom, for pushing back against the administration’s use of federal troops in blue cities.

“Why should they be concerned about the federal government offering help to make their cities a safer place? They should be concerned about this. They should be concerned about the fact that people in their cities right now are being gunned down every single night, and the president all he’s trying to do is fix it,” the press secretary said.

White House touts ongoing negotiations in Egypt as 'incredible achievement'

Karoline Leavitt branded the ongoing technical talks in Egypt between negotiators, including special envoy Steve Witkoff, as “incredible”.

“The president wants to see a cease fire. He wants to see the hostages released, and the technical teams are discussing that as we speak, to ensure that the environment is perfect to release those hostages,” Leavitt said. “They’re going over the list of both the Israeli hostages and also the political prisoners who will be released. And those talks are underway, and the President is very much on the ball and is being apprised of this situation.”

The press secretary just noted that Donald Trump has been in touch with Republican leadership on Capitol Hill.

“The president is being kept very well apprised of the ongoing shutdown,” Leavitt said. “His position is very clear. There’s nothing to negotiate. Just reopen the government and then we can talk about all the important issues facing our country.”

White House repeats misleading claims that Democrats are trying to fund health care for ‘illegal aliens’

At today’s press briefing, Karoline Leavitt continued to repeat the misleading claims from the president and congressional Republicans that the Democrats’ version of a stopgap funding bill is seeking to fund health care for “illegal aliens”.

This is not accurate, as we’ve reported extensively. Undocumented immigrants remain ineligible for federally funded health insurance. The Democrats’ funding patch seeks to reverse many of the cuts to Medicaid that are set to take effect after Trump’s sweeping domestic policy agenda passed earlier this year.

This includes allowing lawfully present noncitizens to still enroll in certain federal health care programs. Leavitt called these immigrants “illegal aliens” who “improperly were granted asylum and paroled under the Biden administration”. All of these people have entered the country legally and are accounted for by the federal government.

Ahead of the White House press briefing, it’s worth noting that a short while ago, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, signed an executive order to establish “Ice free zones” throughout the city.

This order prohibits immigration agents from using city property to carry out any federal immigration operations. “We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority,” Johnson said.

He went on to support Illinois governor JB Pritzker’s lawsuit against the Trump administration for deploying National Guard troops to Chicago. “We reject any attempt to occupy Chicago and we will use every tool at our disposal to resist this federal overreach,” the mayor added.

Donald Trump has said that he had a “very good” telephone call with Brazil’s president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva this morning and that the pair mainly discussed the economy and trade.

“We will be having further discussions, and will get together in the not too distant future, both in Brazil and the United States,” Trump added in a post on Truth Social.

As ordered by Mayor Johnson, City Departments and agencies will identify all spaces that have been or may be used for federal immigration enforcement operations.
This could include, but is not limited to, ensuring that, wherever possible, physical barriers such as locked gates are used to limit access to City property for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.

The order expands upon Mayor Johnson’s Protecting Chicago initiative, inviting local businesses and community organizations to join the citywide effort to safeguard our communities, while advancing measures to rein in the reckless behavior of federal immigration agents.

“We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority. ICE agents are detaining elected officials, tear-gassing protestors, children, and Chicago police officers, and abusing Chicago residents. We will not stand for that in our city,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “With this Executive Order, Chicago stands firm in protecting the Constitutional rights of our residents and immigrant communities and upholding our democracy.”

Mayor Johnson’s most recent Protecting Chicago executive order comes following documented use of Chicago Public Schools parking lots and a City-owned parking lot at Harrison and Kedzie as staging sites for federal immigration enforcement operations, a violation of Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance. The use of City resources for these actions erodes trust between immigrant communities and the City, weakening the relationships that are essential to ensuring community safety and constitutional policing.

Under Mayor Johnon’s leadership, the City is taking swift and decisive action to prevent these transgressions and wield municipal power to protect the safety, dignity, and human rights of every Chicagoan, regardless of race, religion, immigration status, or national origin. As ordered by Mayor Johnson, City Departments and agencies will identify all spaces that have been or may be used for federal immigration enforcement operations. City workers will then ensure that all such properties exhibit clear signage stating:

This property is owned and/or controlled by the City of Chicago.

It may not be used for civil immigration enforcement, including as a:

Staging area

Processing location

Operations base

City Departments and Agencies are directed to implement this order within five days. This could include, but is not limited to, ensuring that, wherever possible, physical barriers such as locked gates are used to limit access to City property for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.

The measure directs that City employees immediately report any attempted use of City property for immigration enforcement; any such instance will be reported to the Office of the Mayor and the Corporation Counsel.

The directive is the latest City-led effort to protect the Constitutional rights of every Chicagoan in concert with Mayor Johnson’s landmark Protecting Chicago initiative. Under Mayor Johnson’s leadership, the City is taking proactive steps to maintain essential trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement while ensuring every Chicagoan can feel safe while accessing City services.

In widely reported incidents, federal agents have been caught on video deploying tear gas outside a public school, acting outside their jurisdiction while putting a resident in a chokehold, and handcuffing a sitting member of the Chicago City Council.

In the wake of the ongoing incursion on the Constitutional rights of Chicagoans and the operations of federal immigration agents designed to stoke fear in communities across Chicago, Mayor Johnson is taking decisive action to protect Chicago’s immigrant community and the Constitutional rights of all Chicagoans.

Today’s order enables increased community participation in the Protecting Chicago initiative. The Mayor’s Office will design and distribute official signage, free of charge, that private landowners and leaseholders can post on their property. The signage clearly states that no federal immigration agents may enter for the purpose of civil immigration enforcement and that the property may not be used as a staging area, processing location, or operations base.

The City will distribute “Know Your Rights” materials that explain the rights of employees, tenants, and security staff when approached by federal agents seeking access to a property

This order does not prohibit the lawful use of City property for purposes unrelated to federal immigration enforcement.

Additional information on Protecting Chicago can be found at chicago.gov/protect. The signed Executive Order will be posted on the City Clerk’s website.

President Trump and Illinois leaders escalated their legal battle over the deployment of National Guard troops to the state Monday, after Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.
President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday criticized a federal judge for blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, calling her ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

“The president has the right to call up the National Guard in cases where he deems it appropriate,” Leavitt said during a news briefing, accusing protesters outside a Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility of “inciting violence.”

Leavitt’s criticism came after US District Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy National Guard troops from other states to the ICE facility.

The administration has since filed an appeal, which Leavitt said Trump expects to win.

“We’re confident in the president’s legal authority to do this, and we’re very confident we will win on the merits of the law,” she said.

Pressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on the administration’s justification for ordering the National Guard to Portland, Leavitt said protesters at the ICE facility had been “disrespecting law enforcement.” She added that the White House will soon host “independent journalists” who have been at the protests to share their first-person accounts.

Over the weekend, demonstrators gathered outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, a Chicago suburb. Six people were arrested Saturday and one on Sunday, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spent part of Friday on the rooftop of the controversial facility, surrounded by armed agents and a camera crew, according to CNN affiliate WLS.

In recent weeks, protests at the facility have been met with tear gas and use of force, including against lawmakers.

Daniel Biss, the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, who is also running for Congress, said he was teargassed at a protest outside Broadview and called the experience “terrifying.” Kat Abughazaleh, a former journalist also running for Congress, was pushed to the ground by a federal law enforcement agent in camouflage, wearing a full face covering, sunglasses and a helmet, during the same protest, according to video from CNN affiliate WBBM.

After a protest Friday, Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes said she was handcuffed in a hospital emergency room during a confrontation with two men she said were ICE agents. Neither was wearing badges.

In their lawsuit Monday to block the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, city and state leaders argue the military is not necessary to keep order during ongoing protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the suburb of Broadview.

“The manufactured nature of the crisis is clear,” the lawsuit states.

Arguing that the need for extra protection in response to protests around federal facilities is only a pretext to deploy the military inside the United States, the 67-page lawsuit cites President Trump’s own words, calling for military action in Chicago even before his second term began.

“The next president needs to send the National Guard to the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago until safety can be restored,” Trump said in July 2022, the lawsuit notes.

The plaintiffs also note the president’s provocative words in a speech last week to military generals in Quantico, Virginia.

“We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military – National Guard, but military – because we’re going into Chicago very soon,” Trump said.

While Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is fighting Trump’s effort to federalize the Illinois National Guard, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott volunteered 400 of his state’s troops to be deployed to other states at Trump’s discretion.

Even with Abbott’s cooperation, Illinois argues the deployment of Texas assets to Chicago would be ” in excess of constitutional and statutory authority.”

“There is no insurrection in Illinois,” the lawsuit states. “There is no rebellion in Illinois.”

Federal law enforcement officers and protesters clashed outside an ICE detention facility in Portland, Oregon, on Sunday night in the wake of a federal judge’s ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard members to the city.

According to video, agents wearing tactical gear – labeled as police, Border Patrol and Department of Homeland Security – deployed gas canisters and stood face-to-face with demonstrators who were shouting and taunting the officers with obscenities and vulgar gestures.

Portland protesters clash with federal agents

In a video filmed on Sunday evening, protesters can be seen clashing with federal agents outside Portland's ICE detention facility. This comes as a federal judge blocked President Trump from sending the National Guard to Oregon.

Portland protesters clash with federal agents

00:50

Many of the protesters wore gas masks, and at least one protester was carried off handcuffed by three federal agents.

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement there were two arrests made on Sunday night in the area of the protests. In total, 36 arrests have been made in the South Waterfront area since the nightly protests began in June, police said.

The context: The protests outside the Portland detention facility have been going on since summer. President Donald Trump has used clashes between protesters and law enforcement outside the facility as justification for deploying the National Guard to protect federal agents at the facility, and to stop the “violent protests” carried out by “domestic terrorists,” he said.

CNN has reached out to ICE and DHS for comment on Sunday night’s activity and number of arrests made.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order Monday prohibiting ICE and other federal agencies from using city property for immigration enforcement.

Johnson said the order is aimed at “reining in this out-of-control administration.” The city also joined the state of Illinois Monday in a lawsuit against Trump’s deployment of the National Guard.

Johnson’s order bars federal agents from using city-owned property for federal immigration operations and encourages local businesses and city organizations to safeguard individual rights, his office said.

“Private establishments can partner with us to make it clear that private property is private property, that ICE cannot enter establishments without a valid warrant,” Johnson said at a news conference Monday.

Johnson said the city may be forced to take further action in the coming weeks.

President Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts to move the military into Chicago and Portland, Oregon, is facing legal challenges on both fronts.

The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, calling plans to move troops from the Illinois and Texas National Guards “illegal, dangerous, and unconstitutional.”

Over the weekend, Trump authorized 300 members of the Illinois National Guard to Chicago to “protect federal officers and assets.” Another 400 members of the Texas National Guard may be deployed there with the cooperation of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Trump’s plan to use the National Guard to help protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June was blocked by a federal judge.

Judge Karin Immergut, who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2019, issued an order Saturday preventing the Oregon National Guard from being federalized for the operation.

Immergut ordered the next day that no Guardsmen from any state could be deployed in Oregon for at least two weeks while she considers the case.

The decision was issued after the Trump administration tried an end-around of the original order by deploying federalized troops from the California National Guard to Portland on Sunday, which led to the state of California joining the lawsuit.

President Trump and Illinois leaders escalated their legal battle over the deployment of National Guard troops to the state Monday, after Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told CNN.

Meanwhile, state leaders vowed to continue fighting the decision in court.

“Illinois is taking the Trump Administration to court for their unlawful and unconstitutional deployment of military troops to our state,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said on X Monday, thanking the state’s attorney general for “helping defend the rule of law.”

The state’s lawsuit argues that the Trump administration has not provided a legitimate legal explanation for its deployment of the troops, “and none exists,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement released by his office.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly for the reason that their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” Raoul said in the statement.

Over the weekend, an American woman was shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent in Chicago, according to the Department of Homeland Security and a charging complaint.

The complaint states that on Saturday, Marimar Martinez and a “convoy” of other civilian vehicles followed a CBP vehicle before “driving into and striking” it.

A CBP agent then got out of his car and fired at Martinez five times. DHS described the shots as “defensive” and said the woman was armed “with a semi-automatic weapon,” although the complaint does not state that she was armed or used a weapon. No law enforcement agents were seriously injured in the incident, according to DHS.

Martinez was treated for a gunshot wound at a hospital and released. She is now in FBI custody, according to DHS.

CNN has reached out to Martinez’ attorney for comment.

Martinez isn’t the first driver to be shot by federal agents during intensified immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. In September, an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who worked as a cook, after a traffic stop. DHS said he resisted arrest and dragged an officer with his vehicle.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-06t053210z-1296236702-rc256haohtzw-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-portland.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-06 14:01:31.479748

No reply. Another knock; nothing. Then Herrera walked to the side of the building, where he saw what he said were two guards behind the facility’s fence. He asked them if they knew anything about his client, Willian Giménez González, who had been taken by ICE that morning in Little Village, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Chicago. According to Herrera, ICE agents stopped Giménez González while he was driving with his wife to get a haircut. They took him away and left his wife, who can’t drive, alone in the car.

The guards listened to Herrera for a moment, then walked away, one of them throwing up a hand as if to say: “Who cares?”

More from Emma Janssen

Herrera left the facility that day with no idea where Giménez González was being held. The next morning, he returned to Broadview with elected officials, other advocates, and Giménez González’s wife to hold a press conference demanding information from ICE. At the end of the press conference, Giménez González’s wife received a phone call from her husband. He confirmed that he was being held in Broadview, just behind the building’s boarded-up windows and chain-link fence.

“His wife handed me the phone. I was talking to him, and his tone changed, and someone asked him who he was talking to,” Herrera said. “And he said, ‘a lawyer.’ And then he told me later that he was made to get off the phone.”

After the press conference, Herrera went home to file a writ of habeas corpus for Giménez González, a legal mechanism that would force a court to re-evaluate Giménez González’s detention and provide a clear justification for it. He filed the petition at midnight, and went to bed.

At 8 the next morning, Giménez González’s wife called Herrera and told him that ICE had transferred her husband out of state. That move nullified Herrera’s legal action. “Because he was in another state at the time that I filed the habeas petition, it couldn’t be heard in Illinois, and the judge just sort of waved it away and transferred it to where he’s being held,” Herrera explained. “I’m not going to talk about where he is [now], because one of the things I’m concerned about is him being moved again.”

HERRERA AND GIMÉNEZ GONZÁLEZ’S EXPERIENCE is increasingly common under ICE’s current regime. It’s not just happening in Chicago, either. Attorneys in New York and Los Angeles told the Prospect similar stories to Herrera’s, outlining how ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate their detainees from both their families and their lawyers, limiting their ability to get out of their predicaments and increasing misery and hopelessness.

Only 23 percent of defendants in immigration court have an attorney in court to represent them. Unlike in criminal courts, defendants in immigration court are not entitled to representation. But even those who do have attorneys are struggling to connect with them.

A data investigation by the Los Angeles Times found that so far this year, 12 percent of ICE detainees have been transferred four or more times. That’s double the number relative to last year.

ICE has a number of stated reasons for these transfers, attorneys told me. Sometimes, the agency says it’s a matter of space. Due to pressure from the administration, ICE is working to meet aggressive arrest quotas, leading to inhumane crowding in their detention facilities.

In Illinois, a well-intentioned law has played into ICE’s hands, giving the agency an excuse to transfer detainees out of state. In 2021, the state passed the Illinois Way Forward Act, which ended immigration detention in the state. When ICE arrests people in Illinois, they are processed at the facility in Broadview and then quickly transferred to facilities in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Kentucky.

“It has functionally meant … that when a person is arrested in Illinois, the government can justify taking them hundreds of miles from their family,” Herrera said of the law.

ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate detainees from both their families and their lawyers.

He said that in court, government lawyers used the law to explain why Giménez González was transferred out of state so quickly. But Herrera pointed to local reporting that says some detainees are held in Illinois’s Broadview facility for as many as five days. That leads him to believe that Giménez González’s transfer was retaliatory, or for the express purpose of keeping him away from his advocates.

Melissa Chua, who leads the Immigration Protection Unit of the New York Legal Assistance Group, said that it’s hard to know exactly why ICE moves its detainees, but that the results are clear.

“The outcome is that it is immensely cruel, and that people who actually do have rights are being strongly pressured to give them up,” Chua said.

New York has a universal defender system, which means that detainees are entitled to representation when they are within the state. But when ICE transfers detainees out of state, they lose that right. “[ICE is] not just isolating them emotionally, but taking them practically away from places where they would have had counsel,” Chua said.

These transfers then lead to a bureaucratic hellscape for those who have been arrested, their families, and their lawyers.

Chua described one client who was moved between five different facilities within the span of eight days. Because of how quickly he was being moved and inaccuracies in ICE’s detainee tracking database, her team was unable to speak with the detainee ahead of the briefing on his habeas case. They kept setting up calls, only to find out that he had been moved to an entirely different facility. “We weren’t able to even confirm that he wanted representation, because we couldn’t even speak to him,” she said.

A CHANGE OF FACILITY BRINGS a host of logistical issues. “It’s never straightforward,” said Ming Tanigawa-Lau, a staff attorney at Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles. “Every place has a different way of requesting a meeting, rules about how far in advance you have to request it, who to contact, what hours they can receive calls at.”

The confusion often means lawyers simply can’t meet with their clients—amounting to a lack of access to counsel. “Maybe if the systems that they had set up were functional, it would be acceptable,” Tanigawa-Lau said, referring to the phone, email, and meeting systems she and other attorneys are navigating. “They’re telling the attorneys that we all have this kind of access. But in practice, it doesn’t work.”

What’s more, ICE detention facilities don’t have a system that allows lawyers to remotely share documents with their clients, or vice versa. That means that lawyers and clients need to meet in person to share and review documents, which becomes complicated when clients are moved out of state and meetings are difficult to schedule.

Immigration attorneys can practice in any state, so having a client transferred out of state doesn’t necessarily mean their connection is severed. But in practice, attorneys told me, their inability to speak to their clients, review legal documents with them, and travel to appear in court functionally means they can’t represent their clients—or, at least, makes it much harder to.

Many immigration judges require clients and attorneys to appear in court in person, rather than virtually over video call. Tanigawa-Lau has represented clients virtually after they had been transferred to a different state, but her colleagues have had to fly out to appear in court. Chua said her team couldn’t represent a client who was transferred from New York to Arizona.

ICE is supposed to notify attorneys when they transfer their clients, Tanigawa-Lau says, but in practice the agency doesn’t. Sometimes, she won’t even know that ICE has transferred her client until she gets a call from their family informing her. That’s what happened in the case of Willian Giménez González in Chicago.

Keeping in touch with clients in other states is a major hurdle. Tanigawa-Lau described being on hold for over 30 minutes just to leave a message for a client, waiting days to schedule a meeting, and having to drive two hours to meet in person at the nearest detention facility to her in Los Angeles.

“One time I had to set up a call for a client on a Monday, and when I got there … I found out that he was actually deported the Saturday before,” she said.

CHUA, IN NEW YORK, IS DEEPLY CONCERNED that this lack of due process is leading to illegal and immoral deportations. Though she gave the caveat that she doesn’t have a specific example, she told me she’s almost certain that ICE has deported U.S. citizens who simply weren’t able to assert their rights without access to a lawyer and their community.

The stakes of ICE detentions and transfers seem higher today than they’ve ever been, due to recent legal decisions that have amped up the cruelty at ICE facilities. Just a month ago, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that anyone who enters the country without inspection doesn’t qualify for bond.

“So, they’re not only moving people hundreds of miles away,” Herrera explained, “but those people can’t get out at all. It’s a really punitive and desperate situation for them.” On top of that, the government’s quotas for arrests mean that detention facilities are inhumanely crowded. Chua said that New York’s 26 Federal Plaza, an immigration court that’s been a highly public site of ICE cruelty, has just four cells where up to 70 people have been held at the same time.

“Because of … the denial of access to counsel, there really aren’t any safeguards or stopgaps that keep someone from being moved or held,” Herrera said. “Everything we worry about when a person is in jail—all bets are off once you don’t have access to a lawyer.”

All told, ICE’s practices of transfers, isolation, and overcrowding amount to a desperate situation where due process rights are too easily ignored. “To me, it seems like cruelty is the point,” Chua said.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23639/download/Janssen-ICE%20Chicago%20100625.jpg?cb=122099bf79dc3718f22072d6839cbf77&w=1024,N,,2025-10-06 14:58:01.142461

He added, ""So, if you have an order to be removed, what is the possible objection to the federal government enforcing that removal order?""
Federal officials on Friday confirmed that Florida has been approved for a $608 million reimbursement for the costs of building and running the immigration detention center.","U.S. government lawyers say that detainees at the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" likely include people who have never been in removal proceedings, which is a direct contradiction to what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been saying since it opened in July.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice made that admission Thursday in a court filing arguing that the detainees at the facility in the Everglades wilderness don't have enough in common to be certified as a class in a lawsuit over whether they're getting proper access to attorneys.

A removal proceeding is a legal process initiated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to determine if someone should be deported from the United States.

The DOJ attorneys wrote that the detainees at the Everglades facility have too many different immigration statuses to be considered a class.

""The proposed class includes all detainees at Alligator Alcatraz, a facility that houses detainees in all stages of immigration processing — presumably including those who have never been in removal proceedings, those who will be placed into removal proceedings, those who are already subject to final orders of removal, those subject to expedited removal, and those detained for the purpose of facilitation removal from the United States pursuant to a final order of removal,"" they wrote.

Since the facility opened, DeSantis has been saying publicly that each detainee has gone through the process of determining that they can't legally be in the United States.

During a July 25 news conference outside the detention center, DeSantis said, ""Everybody here is already on a final removal order.""

""They have been ordered to be removed from the country,"" he added.

At a July 29 speech before a conference of the Florida Sheriffs Association, the Republican governor said, ""The people that are going to the Alligator Alcatraz are illegally in the country. They've all already been given a final order of removal.""

He added, ""So, if you have an order to be removed, what is the possible objection to the federal government enforcing that removal order?""

DeSantis' press office didn't respond Monday morning to an email seeking comment.

The court filing by the DOJ attorneys was made in a lawsuit in which civil rights groups allege the facility's detainees have been denied proper access to attorneys in violation of their constitutional rights. The civil rights groups on Thursday asked a federal judge in Fort Myers for a preliminary injunction that would establish stronger protections for detainees to meet with attorneys privately and share documents confidentially.

The court case is one of three lawsuits filed by environmental and civil rights groups over the detention center, which was hastily built this summer by the state of Florida and operated by private contractors and state agencies.

A federal judge in Miami ordered in August that the facility must wind down operations within two months, agreeing with environmental groups that the remote airstrip site wasn't given a proper environmental review before it was converted into an immigration detention center. But operations continued after the judge's preliminary injunction was put on hold in early September by an appellate court panel. At one point, the facility held more than 900 detainees, but most of them were transferred after the initial injunction. It wasn't clear on Monday how many detainees were at the center, which was built to hold 3,000 people.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. Federal officials on Friday confirmed that Florida has been approved for a $608 million reimbursement for the costs of building and running the immigration detention center.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/09/4f94c8f2-61a1-4810-bac5-23d300451899/thumbnail/1200x630/2dc6911eede1c9c8f15f4f5c7fd1e64b/ap25193643742990.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 14:01:38.003245

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, names the Chicago Headline Club, Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Newspaper Guild, NABET-CWA Local 54041, the Illinois Press Association, and several individual journalists as plaintiffs. They allege that federal officers, acting under the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” targeted members of the press with rubber bullets, pepper balls, tear gas, flash grenades, and arbitrary arrests at demonstrations outside ICE’s Broadview.

“Federal agents have repeatedly fired less-lethal munitions directly at clearly identifiable members of the press,” the complaint states, describing what it calls a coordinated effort to “silence coverage of federal misconduct”.

Among those named as victims:

Raven Geary, a local reporter struck in the face with a pepper ball while taking a photograph, despite wearing a helmet marked “PRESS.”

Charles Thrush, a DePaul journalism student on assignment for Block Club Chicago, who was shot in the hand while filming.

Stephen Held, co-founder of Unraveled Press, tackled, handcuffed, and detained after documenting an arrest—while displaying multiple press credentials.

A CBS Chicago reporter who was attacked in her car when a federal officer fired pepper balls into her vehicle.

The lawsuit alleges violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, seeking injunctive relief to bar federal agents from further violence against journalists, protesters, and clergy who have gathered daily at Broadview in opposition to stepped-up deportations.

The complaint also ties the violence to high-level directives from President Donald Trump, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and other federal officials, accusing them of explicitly encouraging officers to “hammer” demonstrators and redefine protest zones as “free arrest zones.” It cites public comments by Trump labeling reporters “the enemy of the American people” and directing agents to suppress dissent in Democratic strongholds like Chicago.

Local leaders including Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have denounced the federal deployment as an unnecessary occupation. Broadview’s mayor warned that relentless use of tear gas has endangered village residents and first responders.

The lawsuit mirrors similar litigation in Los Angeles, where the L.A. Press Club won a temporary injunction limiting federal agents’ use of crowd-control weapons against reporters and peaceful demonstrators earlier this year. Plaintiffs in Chicago now hope for comparable protections.

“Journalists should not have to choose between their safety and their duty to inform the public,” the plaintiffs argue. “This is about protecting the First Amendment at its breaking point.”

While awaiting a retrial would delay final resolution, the vote switch here will allow the defendants to seek prompt review in New York’s highest court, and the liability judgment will remain while they do that. Allowing a judgment of liability to persist in the face of majority opposition is problematic.

It’s just the latest ICE-tracking initiative to be pulled by tech platforms in the past few days.

A Padlet customer service representative told Celeste, one of the project’s creators, that the map “was trashed due to violations of our Content Policy,” without specifying which policy was violated. Celeste has not disclosed her last name for safety reasons.

But days earlier, the right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had tweeted at Padlet’s CEO about the project.

“Are you aware that @padlet is being used by radical left wing domestic terrorists, illegal aliens and their supporters to obstruct law enforcement operations and harass ICE agents?” she wrote, “PADLET’s Content Policy clearly notes that harassment, stalking, privacy violations, inciting violence, and any other unlawful activity are not on the platform.”

In the same thread, Loomer claimed responsibility for the removal of several similar apps, including ICEBlock, from Apple’s and Google’s app stores last week.

Loomer’s remarks echo statements made by officials at the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security claiming that ICE-tracking projects are responsible for a “1000%” increase in assaults on ICE agents.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has described “violence” against ICE agents as “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxxing them, it’s videotaping them where they’re at when they’re out on operations,” while the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, has indicated that the department “will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

Transparency or doxxing?

Celeste started People over Papers in January, after connecting with other TikTok creators who were also sharing information about ICE raids in their communities. In the 10 months since, it has received over 19 million unique visitors and has been averaging between 200,000 and 300,000 users per day.

She came up with the idea of mapping the raids “to inform people of what is happening in their communities” and says the project is “documenting history and gathering information about something that will likely be looked back on as an extremely dark time.”

It is among a number of volunteer-led efforts, including the ICEBlock app that was removed from app stores last week and the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network, that map anonymous reports about immigration enforcement agents conducting raids.

The maps play an important role in “offer[ing] protection, solidarity, and survival strategies in hostile territory,” Allissa Richardson, a scholar at the University of Southern California who studies how marginalized communities use social media, told MIT Technology Review this summer. They serve as “modern-day Green Books for immigrant communities,” she said. “Just as Black travelers once used the Green Book to navigate safely through a landscape of racial terror, these digital tools help Latine families move through spaces marked by surveillance and risk.”

Pressuring technology platforms to remove the maps is just one part of the administration’s strategy to stop efforts to track ICE or identify its masked agents conducting raids. In early September, DHS subpoenaed Meta for the personal information of users behind the Instagram accounts of the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network and a number of other nonprofit organizations and rapid response networks; the subpoena has been temporarily blocked pending a court hearing.

At least one person has allegedly lost her job in connection to these apps. Carolyn Feinstein, whose husband ran the ICEBlock app, was terminated from her job with the Department of Justice over the summer, which she says was in retaliation for her husband’s work.

“Trying to blunt these efforts to hold federal officers accountable” has the effect of “chilling speech and activism,” says David Greene, the director of civil liberties at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He says that identifying agents does not count as doxxing, because “the idea that law enforcement would be masked and and therefore unaccountable to the people they are serving is really anathema to American values.”

“Saying the doxxing itself is an act of violence would require a different definition of violence than the one we've traditionally used in regards to legal issues,” says Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies threats to public officials.

For its part, the People over Papers map was back online six hours after it was removed from Padlet—this time on its own website, which Celeste’s team has been working on since May and had planned to launch next week.

Celeste says she isn’t cowed: “I am personally super stubborn. The more someone tells me I can’t do something, the more I want to do it.”

Besides, “if this information isn't posted on our platform, it will be posted on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and any other social media platform,” she says. “People will continue to inform each other one way or another.”","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25278024170174.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 12:57:43.877277

Hayes",,,,,https://michiganadvance.com/2025/10/06/immigration-isnt-the-crime-story-were-being-told/,"After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community.
Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city.
This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime.
These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants.
Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.","Drive through Hamtramck today and you’ll see a city that has found new life. After decades of population decline following deindustrialization, waves of immigration from Muslim-majority countries have helped revitalize this Michigan community. Today, crime rates in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods are significantly lower than in other parts of the city. Small businesses line the streets, families walk to school and the community has regained much of the vitality it had lost.

This might seem unexpected to those who follow recent political rhetoric around immigration and crime. In April, when a Michigan lawmaker characterized immigrants as “violent gangbangers, perverts, scammers and all sorts of other criminals,” he was speaking to widely held but unsupported concerns following a surge in immigration. So, what does the evidence actually show?

Consider what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) own data tells us. According to ICE’s September 2025 records from Michigan, the overwhelming majority of those detained, 86%, are classified as having “No ICE Threat Level,” with no prior criminal convictions. Decades of research have actually found that people who are undocumented are more than 30% less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.

What we’re seeing in Hamtramck reflects a broader trend documented across the country, where immigrant communities often contribute to neighborhood stability rather than undermining it. In fact, of the top 10 Michigan cities with the highest proportion of foreign-born residents, the majority had lower than average property crime and violent crime given both their size and poverty levels.

Why would this be? Laurence Benenson, policy liaison at the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force — a group primarily composed of police officers — observes that immigration is highly self-selective; the people willing to uproot their lives are typically motivated, law-abiding individuals, not criminals looking to exploit the system. This explains why crime rates often drop as immigrants move into an area.

Yet media coverage tells a dramatically altered story. Between 2022 and 2024, Fox News aired nearly 1,000 segments on “migrant crime,” with coverage jumping 880% in early 2024. These broadcasts increased even as violent crime declined nationwide and research continued to confirm lower crime rates among immigrants. At the same time, claims that the U.S. is under invasion by transnational Latin American gangs, such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, have been used to justify the use of the Alien Enemies Act, enabling deportations without due process.

But Maya Barak, who teaches criminology at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and specifically studied transnational Latin American gangs like MS-13, says these groups tend to be concentrated on the coasts and aren’t considered a significant public safety threat in Michigan. She adds that most gang violence is between and among rivals and tends not to extend into the community, where they don’t have a foothold.

Under the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, with H.R.1 transforming ICE into the highest-funded domestic enforcement agency, arrests have increased 150% in Michigan. Raids can now proceed at schools, churches and hospitals. Six Michigan cities and counties have signed potentially costly 287(g) agreements, deputizing local law enforcement for immigration duties and paving the way for mass deportation.

This enforcement environment undermines public safety. According to Barak, it pushes people underground out of fear, endangering community trust and limiting law enforcement. Current policies are terrorizing immigrant communities, preventing them from contacting emergency services, which are often intertwined with local police, discouraging life-saving calls. Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer says federal immigration enforcement demands divert local resources from urgent public safety issues like human trafficking.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Immigrant-Heritage-Month.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:38.429748

Welcome to what captivates, haunts, inspires, and surprises me every week in the world of legal ethics.

Happy First Monday! On the first Monday of each month, you get a longer version of the Roundup with the headlines plus reading recommendations, job postings, events, and many other features. The first Monday in October is extra special because it is also the opening day for the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2025 Term.

In 2010, I wrote a law review article called “The Supreme Court’s Increased Attention to the Law of Lawyering: Mere Coincidence or Something More?” I described what has turned out to be the high-water mark for cases involving legal ethics issues taken up by the Supreme Court in a particular term. There were seventeen — seventeen! — such cases during the 2009 Term. You can read the full article here if you want to know more about the cases from the 2009 Term.

But what about the Supreme Court’s docket for the upcoming term? So far we have only one. But to be fair the Court has only granted cert to a few dozen cases to date. I’ll be keeping an eye out. For now, here’s an overview of Villarreal v. Texas, which will be argued today. Along with several other legal ethics scholars, I joined an amicus brief filed in this case. At issue is whether a trial court violates a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel by prohibiting the defendant and his lawyer from discussing testimony during an overnight recess. We argue that a ban on discussions like this jeopardizes the lawyer’s compliance with core professional responsibilities and undermines attorney-client privilege and the duty of confidentiality. Read more and download the amicus brief here.

In totally-unrelated-to-legal-ethics news, I’ve been listening nonstop to the newly-released album from Taylor Swift, The Life of a Showgirl (reviewed here by The New York Times – gift link). At the moment, my favorite tracks are CANCELLED! and Opalite. Whatever you think of her music, she always leaves her fans with something to look forward to. I hope that’s what I’m doing here for legal ethics fans each week!

Now, let’s get started with the headlines. Don’t forget to keep scrolling down to the very end for all the “First Monday” extra features. Enjoy!

Highlights from the Past Week – Top Ten Headlines

#1 “Texas Plans to End ABA’s Role in State’s Law School Oversight.” From Reuters: “The Supreme Court of Texas said in an order on Friday that it ‘is of the tentative opinion that the ABA should no longer have the final say’ on whether a law school’s alumni can sit for the Texas Bar or be licensed….University of Houston law dean Leonard Baynes told Reuters on Monday that he was pleased the court showed commitment to law degree portability and avoiding onerous requirements on law schools. But Baynes said the ‘order creates uncertainty for legal education in the backdrop of an already chaotic world of higher education.’” Read more here.

#2 “The Justice Department Seeks Information on the Georgia D.A. Who Prosecuted Trump.” From the New York Times: “The Department of Justice has issued a subpoena for records related to the travel history of Fani T. Willis, the Georgia district attorney who charged President Trump in a sweeping election interference case, according to a federal grand jury subpoena reviewed by The New York Times. The scope of the investigation is not yet clear. Also unclear is whether Ms. Willis is the target of the inquiry and whether she will ultimately face charges. Grand jury proceedings are secretive by law. But the document reviewed by The Times is an indication that the Justice Department under President Trump may be investigating another one of his old foes.” Read more here.

#3 “Michigan Justices Issue Scaled-Back Judicial Anti-Bias Rule.” From Bloomberg Law: “The Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday tweaked a conduct rule barring judges from exhibiting bias or harassing those in their courtrooms, but didn’t go as far as a proposal from earlier this year. The rule previously said a judge ‘should’ treat everyone fairly and respectfully, ‘without regard to a person’s race, gender, or other protected personal characteristic.’ The new one, which goes into effect Jan. 1, says a judge must perform their duties ‘without bias or prejudice.’ It changes ‘should’ to ‘shall,’ and says they ‘shall not intentionally or recklessly, in the performance of judicial duties, manifest bias or prejudice’.” Read more here.

#4 “What Ethics Rules Say On Atty Discipline For Online Speech.” From the Law360: “Though law firms are free to discipline employees for their online commentary about Charlie Kirk or other social media activity, saying crude or insensitive things on the internet generally doesn’t subject attorneys to professional discipline under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, says Stacie H. Rosenzweig at Halling & Cayo.” Read more here.

#5 “Ethics Opinion 1286: Requesting Former Clients to Write Google Reviews.” From the New York State Bar Association: “A lawyer may ask a former client to write a Google review of the lawyer’s services, and may offer the former client a nominal gift for doing so, provided the lawyer does not draft the Google review for the client or condition the gift on the content of the review. The lawyer may not use the former client’s confidential information to the disadvantage of the former client.” Read more here.

# 6 “Supreme Court Ethics Issues Trace to John Roberts’ ‘Original Sin,’ New Book Alleges.” From the Rolling Stone: “When he was pitching himself to George W. Bush for a seat on the highest court in the land, John Roberts famously declared that judges should be like ‘umpires,’ making calls but never stepping up to the plate for either team. Bush liked the line so much he didn’t just give Roberts a seat on the Supreme Court, he installed him as chief justice — the youngest person to hold that job in almost 200 years. A new book, Without Precedent — an excerpt of which has been shared exclusively with Rolling Stone — suggests another powerful reason why Bush may have felt such extraordinary confidence appointing Roberts to the most powerful position in the U.S. judiciary. At the time that Roberts was auditioning for the job, he was also presiding over a critical case to which the Bush administration was a party — and rather than acting as an ump in that case, author Lisa Graves suggests, Roberts was practically pinch-hitting for Bush and his cronies.” Read more here.

#7 “Using Military Lawyers as Immigration Judges is Ill-Advised and Potentially Illegal.” From the Brennan Center for Justice: “The Trump administration’s reported authorization of 600 military lawyers to act as temporary immigration judges would deprive immigrants of a fair hearing and further erode the line between the military and civilian government. This is true regardless of the professionalism of the military lawyers. Immigration judges are specially trained administrative judges in the Department of Justice who oversee deportation hearings. … In addition, ethical rules are fundamental to the rule of law, but the legal and ethical obligations of military lawyers and immigration judges are in tension.” Read more here.

#8 “Update to ‘Conflict U.’: Some Judges Are Recusing Due to a University Conflict.” From Fix the Court: “In July, Fix the Court released a report called Conflict U. that identified 24 federal judges who did not recuse in six dozen cases involving the universities where they also serve as law school instructors. This practice raises clear conflict-of-interest concerns, despite being sanctioned by judiciary policy. The report urges reforms to strengthen recusal practices and restore public trust in judicial ethics. This past month, Fix the Court conducted follow-up research on this issue, and what we found was somewhat surprising: several judges with adjunct positions at law schools are, in fact, choosing to recuse when the law schools’ parent universities find themselves in their courtrooms.” Read more here.

#9 “Law, Layers and the Battle Against Antisemitism.” From Eli Wald (Denver) in JOTWELL reviewing Antisemitism and the Law by Robert Katz: “According to the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer is ‘a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice. As Deborah Rhode has astutely pointed out, however, lawyers’ duties as public citizens have long been more of a rhetorical ploy than an actual commitment, in need of elaboration and exposition. In the twenty-first century, lawyers have been forced to come to terms with their asserted role as public citizens in the face of the #MeToo and the Black Lives Matter movements, reform calls for the deregulation of the legal profession designed to increase access to legal services for those who cannot afford to pay for them, and attacks on the rule of law. Professor Robert Katz’ new casebook, Antisemitism and the Law, constitutes an important contribution sure to help those aiming to understand the obligations of lawyers to pursue justice and combat discrimination.” Read more here.

#10 “Dealing with Social Media & Public Comment: Legal Ethics Lessons for Corporate Counsel.” From JD Supra: “Social media can turn small moments into corporate crises overnight. For in-house counsel, the ethical challenges are particularly complex: protecting confidential information, addressing employee conduct, and managing public backlash when private behavior goes viral. … The Oklahoma and Texas Rules of Professional Conduct frame the lawyer’s obligations when social media collides with the workplace.” Read more here.

“Legal Insurance and Its Limits” by Nora Freeman Engstrom (Stanford). From the abstract:

Courts are buckling under the weight of a staggering access-to-justice crisis. In three-quarters of cases, at least one side lacks a lawyer, default judgments are on the rise, and most Americans with valid claims never take legal action. The situation is dire, and it understandably has policymakers casting about for a fix. On the menu are a range of uncontroversial reform ideas, such as expanding legal aid, supporting system simplification, and promoting pro bono. But it is increasingly clear that those measures—even if accomplished—would not make a dent in the problem. Attention is thus turning to other reform ideas, such as relaxing unauthorized practice of law (UPL) rules and scrapping Model Rule 5.4(d), the provision that prevents nonlawyers from even partially owning entities that deliver legal services. Both reforms are promising. But both would dilute the longstanding lawyers’ monopoly. Perhaps not surprisingly, the bar is fighting these reforms tooth-and-nail.

Into this roiling landscape, some now have a new idea: legal insurance. They suggest that legal insurance is the way to expand access to justice for middle and working-class Americans. Reformers are also quick to point out that—unlike a relaxation of UPL restrictions or the abolition of Rule 5.4(d)—legal insurance stands to benefit lawyers.

We have seen this play before. In the 1970s, the bar seized on legal insurance as a solution to what was then seen as an urgent access-to-justice crisis afflicting the middle-class. … This Article recovers the lost history of the country’s first experiment with legal insurance. In so doing, it seeks to forestall another false start. In addition, by drawing on a range of disciplines—including insurance law (particularly insights concerning moral hazard and adverse selection), behavioral economics, legal ethics, and the legal profession—this Article explains why the legal insurance idea floundered, and seems destined to flounder, going forward.

“Interoperable Legal AI for Access to Justice” by Drew Simshaw (UNLV). From the abstract:

The access-to-justice gap is growing, affecting individuals with both civil and criminal needs in the United States. Though these challenges are multifaceted, procedural barriers in the U.S. legal system can often inhibit access-to-justice efforts. The resulting inequities undermine fairness for those interacting with courts and jeopardize the legitimacy of the broader legal system. Legal technology driven by artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its potential to combat these challenges on three access-to-justice fronts that are often conceptualized in isolation: a consumer (i.e., self-help) front, a legal-service-provider front, and a court front. Progress on each of these fronts is apparent, though not at the pace or scale necessary to make meaningful inroads into closing the justice gap nationwide. The time has come to appreciate that, although progress on all three fronts is necessary for closing the justice gap and maximizing fairness, it is insufficient if there is not also some level of shared commitment and coordination across – and not just within – all fronts. This Essay argues that technological and procedural legal interoperability – that is, widespread consistency in technology design and related processes – should be at the forefront of these efforts, particularly as they relate to artificial intelligence. Further, although the consumer and legal-services fronts remain critically important, courts should be recognized as the necessary drivers in achieving this interoperable legal AI.

PITTSBURGH, PA – OCTOBER 6, 2025 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Federal Law Enforcement, Congresswoman Shontel Brown (OH-11), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation, and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) led a letter raising urgent concerns over reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has activated a contract with Paragon Solutions, a foreign spyware company whose surveillance product ""Graphite"" has the ability to covertly access private data on Americans’ cell phones without their knowledge or consent.

In the letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers warn that ICE’s potential use of Graphite, which employs “zero-click” exploits to access encrypted messages, photos, and real-time location data, poses a serious threat to civil liberties, privacy, and constitutional protections—all of which have been undermined under the Trump Administration.

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote.

The letter references alarming reports that Paragon spyware has already been used to target journalists and human rights advocates in Europe. It also invokes Supreme Court rulings — Riley v. California (2014) and Carpenter v. United States (2018) — which affirmed the need for a warrant before law enforcement can access cell phone content or location data.

In light of potential constitutional violations, the Members are demanding transparency and oversight. Specifically, they are requesting:

All communications and documents discussing ICE’s use of spyware, including but not limited to Paragon Solutions software like Graphite;

All communications and documents regarding the legality of and legal justification for using spyware or mass electronic surveillance for immigration enforcement;

A comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE’s strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States; and

All communications and documents regarding the legality of using spyware against individuals residing within the United States given Executive Order 14093.

“Allowing ICE access to spyware that can be used to easily track and monitor the public—including those vocally opposed to governmental overreach— threatens Americans’ freedom of movement and freedom of speech...[and] raises serious questions about whether ICE will respect Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure for people residing in the U.S,” the letter concludes.

The Members of Congress are seeking a full response from DHS by October 14, 2025.

This is the second batch of deportees that the Trump administration has sent to Eswatini as part of its hard-line approach towards immigration.

The 10 have been ""securely accommodated"", and posed no threat to the public, Eswatini's prison department said in a statement.

Eswatini human rights lawyer Mzwandile Masuku told the BBC he was ""shocked and dismayed"" that the government had taken in the group, despite an ongoing court case against the arrival of five deportees in July.

The US had described the five - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as ""depraved monsters"".

The Jamaican has since been repatriated to his country of origin, while another two were expected to be repatriated soon, Eswatini's government says.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would take in 11 deportees following an agreement with the US ""to cooperate in this manner"".

It did not explain why only 10 had arrived.

Their names have not been made public.

Deported from the US to Ghana then 'dumped' at the border: Nigerian man speaks out

Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent

The BBC reported in September that the Trump administration had told Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the centre of a long-running immigration row, he could be deported to the southern African kingdom.

The administration alleges that he was a member of a transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then returned to the US where he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He pleaded not guilty.

A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for ""vindictive"" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision.

The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported.

In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a ""secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin"".

Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane.

Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected the government to ""respect the court process and await its ruling"" before accepting more deportees.

In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments.

It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its ""border and migration management capacity"", HRW said.

The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to ""executive over-reach"" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance.

Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.

The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of ""democratic regression"", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.

""We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,"" the SALC's Melusi Simelane told the BBC.

The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.

Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at ""top clearance level"".

The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border.

Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area.
Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement.
A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities’ restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE — a 10-fold increase in its current budget — as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress’ failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration’s top priority, is still flush with cash.

Millions spent on the 30-second ads

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,” according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Monday, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city’s mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

Local police can’t compete with ICE promises

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city’s Police Officers Association, said he’d seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city’s police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.”

The government shutdown could dampen ICE’s recruitment hopes, he said.

“They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,” he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it’s too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city’s recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It’s the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who’s in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That’s all this is, strengthening the belief that they’re doing something.”

The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.

JB Pritzker said Sunday night.

The Democrat blasted Trump’s “invasion” hours after the president mobilized 300 California National Guard members to Portland, where unrest has raged for over 100 consecutive days outside an immigration detention center — a scene that has been playing out in Chicago since September.

Pritzker said the plan defies his wishes, adding that federal officials haven’t reached out to coordinate or discuss the deployment.

“We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion,” the governor said in a post on X, encouraging “every American to speak up and help stop this madness.”

“It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will not involve sending in another state’s military troops. I call on [Texas] Governor [Greg] Abbott to immediately withdraw any support for this decision and refuse to coordinate.”

Pritzker condemned Trump for wanting to send active-duty troops to a “sovereign state” without permission, accusing the president of using the National Guard as “political props.”

The White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

A violent wave of anti-ICE protests has intensified in the Windy City since US Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” an initiative aimed at targeting criminal illegal immigrants who feds say flocked to Chicago to seek protection under the state’s “sanctuary policies.”

The immigration enforcement operation has drawn pushback from Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other prominent local Democrats.

But despite their objections, demonstrations have escalated in recent days, with protesters using vehicles to attack ICE agents in the Chicago area, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said agents were targeted twice in such a manner one day earlier this week.

US Border Patrol agents patrolling Chicago’s South Side on Saturday also opened fire and wounded a woman — later found to be armed — after an angry mob attempted to attack the federal officers.

The agents were located about 15 miles from an ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, a site that’s been a hotbed of civil unrest, when the ambush began.

More than a dozen protesters have been arrested near the ICE facility since Friday, according to Fox News.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem — who touched down in Illinois Friday morning — called Chicago a “war zone” during an interview Sunday with “Fox & Friends Weekend.”

Caveat: Researchers also warn that ICE data is typically incomplete, suggesting there could be an undercount of solitary confinement placements.
Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas, had the second-highest (1,075), followed by Buffalo Service Processing Center (642) in Batavia, New York, and South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Texas (488).
Solitary confinement is not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but violates U.S. and international law.
Yes, but: Prisoner advocates say ""administrative segregation"" is just a euphemism for solitary confinement, and that the differences are minimal.","The researchers focused on immigrant detention centers, which experts say are primarily used to hold immigrants and ensure they make their court hearings and check-ins — not to punish them for immigration violations.

Driving the news: Nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers nationwide between April 2024 and August 2025, per new data provided exclusively to Axios.

Researchers detailed an increase in solitary confinement placements and, for some populations, weeks-long isolation periods, in a recent report that focused on data between April 2024 and May 2025.

The report, which relies on ICE's data collections, didn't show the duration of solitary confinement placements for all detainees, just for those labeled as ""vulnerable,"" like those with mental health issues.

Zoom in: Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" who make up one-fifth of detainees between April 2024 and May, were placed in solitary confinement for an average of 38 days in the first three months of 2025.

In 2021, the average duration was 14 days, per the report.

ICE's own directives suggest using solitary confinement on people with mental health conditions only as a last resort.

This often happened in state and county jails contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold detainees.

Caveat: Researchers also warn that ICE data is typically incomplete, suggesting there could be an undercount of solitary confinement placements.

By the numbers: The report found that Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, had the highest number of people isolated (1,905) through May.

Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas, had the second-highest (1,075), followed by Buffalo Service Processing Center (642) in Batavia, New York, and South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Texas (488).

What they're saying: ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" says Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that uses medicine to advocate against human rights violations.

Solitary confinement is not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but violates U.S. and international law.

ICE didn't respond to several emails from Axios seeking comment.

The other side: Some jails and prisons, like in Massachusetts, say they have shifted away from solitary confinement and instead practice ""administrative segregation,"" which involves separating detainees believed to pose a threat to safety, property or correctional operations.

Massachusetts officials say segregated detainees regularly interact with staff clinicians and sometimes inmates, and that they have daily access to mental health clinicians.

Yes, but: Prisoner advocates say ""administrative segregation"" is just a euphemism for solitary confinement, and that the differences are minimal.

What's next: The report urged state and local officials to use their own power to end or reduce the use of solitary confinement in local facilities with ICE contracts.

The report also suggested unplanned facility inspections by local officials and steps to ensure detainees have legal representation, interpreters and due process protections.

The bottom line: ""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people, and these are people who are not imprisoned for criminal activity,"" Zarifi said.",https://images.axios.com/kLIrmxNB88IRcHKWScYhfUNbOLk=/0x9:1300x740/1366x768/2025/10/06/1759756539443.png,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:50.402810

But Immergut, the Oregon judge, ruled Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” enough to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard.
In an interview with CalMatters, Voss said the order specifically blocked Hegseth’s federalization of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard — it wasn’t a restraining order on all National Guard deployments.
The 300 California National Guard troops Trump is deploying to Oregon are a holdover from his June activation.
After most of the 4,700 troops left Los Angeles, Trump in August ordered 300 California National Guard troops to remain deployed in Southern California.","Hours after California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against the Trump administration Sunday seeking to prevent the president from sending 300 California National guard troops to Portland, Ore., a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order blocking federalized deployment from any state to Oregon.

The order came during an extraordinary Sunday night hearing after Oregon and California attorneys revealed that in addition to trying to send California troops to Oregon, President Trump’s War Secretary, Pete Hegseth, had ordered Texas National Guard members to deploy as well.

Oregon District Court Judge Karin Immergut interrupted Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton repeatedly during the hearing, saying the administration was trying to circumvent an order she issued Saturday temporarily halting the use of Oregon Guard troops in Portland.

She said that she sees the conduct of the Trump administration, and its federalization of 400 Texas National Guard troops, as a “direct contravention of the order that this court issued yesterday.” The Texas National Guard was also slated for Chicago and other locations, a legal document said.

At another point in the hearing she asked, “aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order, which relies on the conditions in Portland, and nothing has changed? Another point in the hearing. “So why is this appropriate?”

Hamilton, a deputy assistant attorney general, argued that the White House was authorized to send in the California National Guard, despite Immergut’s Saturday order, because the California troops were called up under a different Trump memo in June. Immergut dismissed that line of reasoning. “Mr. Hamilton, you are missing the point, because here it’s the conditions on the ground in Oregon that was a basis for my finding” yesterday. And those conditions haven’t changed.

After the 30-minute hearing, which was delayed nearly an hour for technical reasons, Bonta issued a statement applauding Immergut’s ruling.

“The President’s move to deploy the National Guard of one state over the objections of a Governor to another state over the objections of a second is well outside of the norms or practices of any President in recent history.” Bonta wrote. “This fight isn’t over, but today’s rebuke of the President’s illegal actions is a step in the right direction.” This was California 42nd suit against Trump in 36 weeks.

Stephen Miller, a senior White House advisor, condemned the judge’s decision Sunday in a social media post. “A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property.” Federal appeals court judges, including those appointed by Trump, disagree and have ruled that they can review a president’s decisions, but with deference.

He also called the ruling “one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen — and is yet the latest example of unceasing efforts to nullify the 2024 election by fiat.”

On Saturday, Immergut temporarily blocked the administration from activating a contingent of the Oregon National Guard to combat what President Donald Trump calls lawless behavior emanating from immigration protests in Portland.

Hegseth responded by calling in California troops. As of Sunday evening, 100 California Guard members had already arrived in Portland.

“The stakes could not be higher,” Bonta said before Sunday’s hearing. “People should understand clearly what is happening here: The president is seeking to deploy the California National Guard as federal military police indefinitely anywhere in the country. He’s not even hiding the ball.”

He and legal representatives for Portland and Oregon sought a temporary halt to the deployment of California troops.

Bonta’s messaging echoes Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said in a statement Sunday morning that: “we will take this fight to court, but the public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States.”

By Sunday morning 100 California National Guard troops arrived in Portland by plane from Los Angeles, the amended suit says. Hegseth intends to send another 200 California National Guard troops soon, Bonta added.

Trump has characterized Portland and other Democratic-run cities as dangerous, high-crime zones and last week told a gathering of U.S. generals that the military should “use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military.”

Trump’s moves are ‘unique’

In the suit filed Sunday evening, lawyers for California and Oregon argue that the White House is again failing to meet the standards of the federal law that would permit Hegseth to federalize any National Guard troops — Title 10, Section 12406.

It also says that the initial reason for federalizing the California National Guard to Los Angeles is “wholly unrelated” to the Trump administration’s goals in Portland.

Bonta expressed dismay over the shifting reasons to deploy California’s troops. The White House does “not have the carte blanche … to deploy whatever military they want, whenever they want,” he said at the press conference.

The suit also argues that the Trump White House is violating a 19th century federal law prohibiting federal troops from acting as law enforcement.

The dynamic is highly unusual, in no small part because Trump is essentially pulling troops from one state that has opposed his use of the National Guard to another state where political leaders also reject Trump’s moves.

“I don’t think we’ve seen this scenario before, I think it is unique,” Bonta said.

Trump claims he must deploy federalized troops because Portland is under siege by protesters opposing the administration’s immigration enforcement actions.

But Immergut, the Oregon judge, ruled Saturday that the protests there are “not significantly violent or disruptive” enough to justify Trump’s use of Oregon’s National Guard. Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued her decision as part of a temporary restraining order against the federal government after Oregon and city of Portland sued the administration last week.

Protesters there set up “a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials” while others flashed bright lights into the eyes of federal officials driving, Immergut summarized. “These incidents are inexcusable, but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces,” Immergut wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.”

The Trump administration on Saturday appealed that decision to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

What’s likely new

Immergut’s order over the weekend was narrow, said Loren Voss, a fellow at the legal affairs publication Lawfare who’s taught classes on domestic deployment of the military. In an interview with CalMatters, Voss said the order specifically blocked Hegseth’s federalization of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard — it wasn’t a restraining order on all National Guard deployments.

“But one of their (Oregon’s) big arguments, and one that judge Immergut found persuasive, was a diversion of their National Guard members from state responsibilities, right, which would not apply here,” Voss said.

She expects several overlapping legal proceedings to unfold. In addition to Newsom’s vow to sue, the Ninth Circuit may weigh in shortly on Immergut’s Saturday decision in response to the Trump administration’s emergency appeal, which could shape how future legal challenges unfold.

Voss noted that Trump federalized the California National Guard because of protests in Los Angeles, but now they’re being assigned to duties in Portland for a different purpose. “This is an interesting legal question,” she said. “I think there is a good challenge that can be made there.”

Trump sent thousands of troops into L.A.

California sued Trump in June after the president federalized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops and 700 Marines to protect federal property and provide support for federal immigration law enforcement officers after protests across Los Angeles County erupted over immigration sweeps.

A district judge, appointed by President Bill Clinton, sided with Newsom by issuing a temporary restraining order against Trump’s use of the National Guard in June. But a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit blocked that decision, giving Trump control of the federal troops again.

The 300 California National Guard troops Trump is deploying to Oregon are a holdover from his June activation. After most of the 4,700 troops left Los Angeles, Trump in August ordered 300 California National Guard troops to remain deployed in Southern California. Those are the troops Hegseth is sending to Oregon. Bonta had already sued to stop that extended deployment before Sunday’s suit.

The Oregon judge’s decision doesn’t conflict with the higher court’s reasons for returning the federal troops to Trump, said Kelly Simon, a legal director at the ACLU of Oregon, during a press conference.

The appeals court said judges can review such military decisions, rejecting an argument by Trump administration lawyers. And while the “courts have to give a substantial deference” to a president’s decision to deploy National Guard troops to a state against the wishes of a governor, the White House still has to make that “determination rooted in fact,” Simon said. “The president’s determination was untethered from the facts.”

The California federal lower court judge also ruled in September that federal troops were used for law enforcement purposes, a violation of a 19th-century law banning the military from such activity.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Judge Charles Breyer. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”

He blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the Trump administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-27.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:53.480657

Courts Find That Public Policy Does Not Prohibit Coverage for TVPRA Claims Many states prohibit insurance coverage for criminal acts or intentionally inflicted injuries on public policy grounds.
Insurers have sought to extend these public policy prohibitions to human trafficking claims.
Liberty Mutual raised the issue of intent in arguing that public policy precludes coverage for the Red Roof Inn defendants, pointing to Georgia law that states it is against public policy to insure against injuries intentionally inflicted.","Increasingly, many companies are finding themselves entangled in human trafficking claims under federal and state laws. The federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and similar state laws cast a wide net that is intended to snare those involved in or those that ""knowingly benefit"" from trafficking. Industries such as agriculture, construction, transportation, technology, banking, hospitality, and others are vulnerable to trafficking claims.

In addition to ""perpetrator liability"" for those directly involved in trafficking, the TVPRA allows victims to pursue civil claims against individuals and entities that benefit from the trafficking. To assert a claim for ""beneficiary liability,"" a plaintiff must allege, and ultimately prove, (1) the defendant knowingly benefitted from (2) participation in a venture (3) that it knew or should have known engaged in trafficking, including forced labor and sex trafficking. Recent examples include:

Filipino migrant workers alleging forced labor and violations of the TVPRA sued CH2M Hill International, Jacob Engineering Group, and related companies that worked with the Qatari government to construct soccer stadiums and facilities as part of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank faced civil lawsuits from victims of Jeffrey Epstein for their alleged role in facilitating and profiting from the trafficking.

com, Inc. faces multiple TVPRA lawsuits alleging that it assisted, supported, and facilitated sex trafficking by selling its software tools and providing operational support to Backpage.com.

According to the Human Trafficking Legal Center, the number of TVPRA filings has increased from six in 2004 to 280 in 2024. Unsurprisingly, the increase in TVPRA civil claims has led to an increase in disputes over insurance coverage for such claims.

Two recent decisions add to a growing number of courts concluding that TVPRA claims may trigger coverage under Coverage A (bodily injury and property damage) and/or Coverage B (personal and advertising injury) of a commercial general liability (CGL) policy. In both cases, the court rejected the insurers' arguments that (1) policy exclusions precluded coverage and/or (2) public policy barred coverage.

Courts Find That TVPRA Allegations Trigger Coverage

In Peerless Indemnity Insurance Company, et. al. v. Tilma, Inc., No. 24-492 (U.S.D.C. E.D. VA July 22, 2025), the court dismissed the insurers' lawsuit seeking a declaration that the insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify an insured alleged to have violated the TVPRA. The court concluded that the insurers had a duty to defend and indemnify the insured in the underlying trafficking lawsuit ""because the Policy unambiguously covers the conduct alleged against [the insured]."" Id. at 6. In the underlying lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged she was trafficked, her traffickers used the insured's hotel for their crimes, and that the insured turned a blind eye to the trafficking.

The Peerless court found that Coverage B encompassed the alleged conduct. Like standard CGL policies, the policy at issue in Peerless provided coverage for ""personal and advertising injuries,"" including injuries ""arising out of … false arrest, detention, or imprisonment."" Id. at 7. The Peerless court explained that the underlying complaint alleged the insured ""knew or should have known that [the victim] was being detained"" and that employees ""overheard [the victim] screaming while her trafficker caught her, dragged her back to her hotel room, and beat her following her attempt to escape her trafficker."" Id. The court properly concluded that the complaint's ""know or should have known"" language sounded in negligence, and the allegations alleged detention as defined under Virginia law. Therefore, the complaint alleged ""personal and advertising injury"" covered under the policy.

In Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., et. al., No. 23-02047 (U.S.D.C. N.D. Georgia August 15, 2025), the court concluded that ""Georgia law requires a finding that Plaintiff has a duty to defend the Red Roof Defendants"" in the underlying lawsuit under Coverage A of the policy. Liberty Mutual argued the underlying allegations did not trigger coverage because there were no allegations of ""bodily injury"" caused by an ""occurrence."" Liberty Mutual predicated its position on the definition of ""occurrence"" defined in the policy as ""an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions."" Liberty Mutual pointed to allegations of the insureds' active and intentional participation in the trafficking scheme, arguing that such intentional conduct could not be accidental. The Red Roof Inn defendants, however, argued that whether an event is an accident must be determined from the viewpoint of the insured and whether the insured's conduct was designed to injure the victim. Stated another way, the alleged injury would only not satisfy the ""occurrence"" definition if the insured subjectively intended or expected to cause specific injury to the plaintiff.

The court agreed with the Red Roof Inn defendants, noting that, while the complaint did include allegations of intentional conduct, the complaint also included allegations that the insureds ""should have known"" of the trafficking. The court correctly held that such ""constructive knowledge language sounds in negligence and implies that the Red Roof Defendants did not have the requisite intent to cause [the victim's] alleged bodily injuries."" Id. at 13. The court cited to Georgia law, reasoning that an insurer has a duty to defend if the facts as alleged ""even arguably bring the occurrence with the policy's coverage."" Id. And, because the insureds ""were alleged to be negligent in regard to the TVPRA violations, the Court finds that [Plaintiff's] complaint is arguably covered by the ‘bodily injury from an occurrence' provision of Coverage A.""

Courts Find That Policy Exclusions Do Not Preclude Coverage

Having concluded the allegations triggered coverage, both courts turned to the policy exclusions the insurers argued precluded coverage. Both courts properly found the exclusions inapplicable by focusing on the allegations and conduct of the insured as opposed to those of the traffickers.

In the Peerless matter, the insurer argued that an exclusion precluding coverage for ""personal and advertising injuries caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict personal and advertising injury"" applied. The court disagreed because the underlying complaint did not allege the insured itself sexually trafficked the victim or directed her traffickers to commit their intentional tort. Instead, the complaint alleged the insured's lack of action or lack of knowledge of the trafficking made it liable and such allegations do not ""equate to ‘causing or directing' actions with the knowledge that those actions would violate the rights of"" the victim. Similarly, an exclusion for injuries ""arising out of a criminal act committed by or at the direction of the insured"" was inapplicable because there were no allegations that the insured committed or directed the criminal conduct.

Likewise, the Liberty Mutual court rejected the argument that the Expected or Intended Injury Exclusion, which bars coverage for bodily injury ""expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,"" applied. In analyzing the exclusion, the court noted it must narrowly and strictly construe the provision against the insurer under Georgia law. Given the ""know or should have known"" allegations, the court found that at least some of the allegations did not allege the insureds acted with the intent or expectation of causing bodily injury and, thus, the exclusion did not unambiguously preclude coverage.

Courts Find That Public Policy Does Not Prohibit Coverage for TVPRA Claims

Many states prohibit insurance coverage for criminal acts or intentionally inflicted injuries on public policy grounds. Insurers have sought to extend these public policy prohibitions to human trafficking claims. At least one federal district court did just that, concluding that Pennsylvania's public policy bars coverage for those involved in allegedly enabling or profiting from human trafficking. In Samsung Fire & Marine Ins., Co., (U.S. Branch) v. UFVS Mgmt. Co., LLC, No. CV 18-04365 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2023), the court relied on Pennsylvania's anti-trafficking law, which criminalizes (1) harboring or maintaining a person with reckless disregard to the fact that they will be subject to sex trafficking and (2) knowingly benefitting from such trafficking as evidence of Pennsylvania's overriding public policy against sex trafficking. According to the court, the allegations against the insureds exposed them to independent criminal liability.

On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that deciding the issue would require weighing Pennsylvania's strong presumption of insurance coverage against Pennsylvania's public policy against sex trafficking and, because the court could not predict how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would rule, it certified the issue to the Supreme Court. Samsung Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (U.S. Branch) v. RI Settlement Tr., No. 23-1988 (3d Cir. Aug. 12, 2024). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted certification, and the case remains pending.

Beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, however, is not limited to criminal conduct and, for defendants that purportedly knowingly benefit from trafficking, plaintiffs often allege conduct that falls short of criminal as demonstrated in the Peerless matter. After ruling that the criminal act exclusion did not apply, the Peerless court addressed the insurers' argument that Virginia public policy prohibits coverage for criminal acts prohibited by the TVPRA. In rejecting this argument, the court explained that Virginia courts prohibit coverage only in cases where the insured acts with specific intent to cause harm. The court further explained that beneficiary liability under the TVPRA does not require specific intent on the part of a beneficiary and there were no such allegations in the underlying complaint.

Liberty Mutual raised the issue of intent in arguing that public policy precludes coverage for the Red Roof Inn defendants, pointing to Georgia law that states it is against public policy to insure against injuries intentionally inflicted. According to Liberty Mutual, because the Red Roof Inn defendants participated in the sex trafficking venture where injuries are often intentionally inflicted, it goes against public policy to provide coverage. The Liberty Mutual court rejected this argument, explaining that ""Georgia's public policy exclusion focuses on whether the injuries were intentionally inflicted, not simply whether the conduct was intentional,"" and there were no allegations that the insureds (as opposed to the traffickers) intended to injure the victims. Additionally, the Liberty Mutual court recognized that the TVPRA does not have a scienter requirement, nor does it require a showing of injurious intent.

The Peerless and Liberty Mutual decisions add to the growing body of case law concluding that TVPRA claims trigger coverage under CGL policies under Coverages A and B, of course depending on the specific allegations and policy language. The decisions also reinforce well-established principles of insurance law, including (1) insurers have a broad duty to defend; (2) exclusionary language must be narrowly and strictly construed against the insurer; and (3) intentional act exclusions focus on the subjective intent of the insured, not the intentional acts of others. Importantly, both courts also recognized that TVPRA beneficiary liability does not require specific intent on the part of the alleged beneficiary, making reliance on public policy difficult where there are allegations the alleged beneficiary acted negligently i.e., ""knew or should have known"" of the trafficking.

In sum, companies are increasingly targets of beneficiary liability claims under the TVPRA and should understand and evaluate the potential risk such lawsuits pose, including what insurance coverage may be available.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7704_2141.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:57:58.533085

Some have engaged in the academic exercise of drawing lines between lawful and unlawful orders.
Few commentators have considered how Trump v. United States has changed the distinction between lawful and unlawful orders.

There are two fundamental principles each member of the military learns when he or she takes the oath of office: first, that superior orders are presumed to be lawful and must be scrupulously obeyed; and, second, that if there is ever a conflict between orders and the law, the law prevails. Over the past year, these principles have come into sharp focus. America’s military personnel – volunteers all – are increasingly alert to the prospect that they may be asked to prioritize loyalty to an individual over their rights and responsibilities under the law.

In 2024, the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that a president is absolutely immune from prosecution for acts within the scope of his core constitutional authority. In the military context, what this could mean is that the other branches of government – Congress and the Judiciary – may not make or enforce any law that would make him criminally liable for any act performed, decision made, or order given in his capacity as commander-in-chief. Although the contours of the Supreme Court’s decision have yet to be fully tested or defined, what is already clear is that – impeachment aside – it effectively places a president above the law and eliminates any legal incentive for him to exercise restraint. This becomes even more dangerous when, as now, a president is ineligible for re-election, since the ballot box does not serve as a check.

The Supreme Court majority’s rationale was that if a president is subject to prosecution for exercising his exclusive constitutional authority – authority widely understood to include at least some aspects of his role as commander-in-chief – he might be “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties.” In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered a couple of military examples – “nightmare scenarios” such as staging a military coup or ordering SEAL Team Six to execute a political rival – to illustrate her conviction that, as a result of the majority’s decision, “the President is now a king above the law.”

The majority focused on the president’s authority and prerogatives; the dissenters focused on the potential havoc an unrestrained president might wreak. It’s understandable that no one examined the impact of this decision on military personnel who might be ordered to carry out orders for which a president can no longer be held accountable. Understandable because, other than Justice Samuel Alito (who served on active duty in the Army for three months following his law school graduation) no Justice has any military experience. Unfortunately, by failing to consider the impact of its decision on the military, the Court placed the entire burden of dealing with an unbounded commander-in-chief upon those serving in uniform and other federal employees who are subject to his orders.

When Is an Order Unlawful?

Following the reelection of Donald Trump, much has been written about the military’s obligation to obey lawful orders and right to disobey unlawful orders. Some have engaged in the academic exercise of drawing lines between lawful and unlawful orders. Others have suggested that military leaders standing firm against this president’s autocratic tendencies may be American democracy’s last hope. Few commentators have considered how Trump v. United States has changed the distinction between lawful and unlawful orders. Before the Supreme Court’ s decision, an order to kill unarmed civilians would have universally been considered an unlawful order. Think: My Lai Massacre, when hundreds of civilians were murdered by U.S. soldiers in Vietnam in 1968. Today, that conclusion is far less certain. Why?

First, although most scholars believe limiting the president’s criminal accountability has no effect on the prosecution of military personnel who violate the law pursuant to his orders, the case left a door open to the notion that absolute immunity might also extend to the president’s agents. If the Court is truly concerned that a president subject to criminal prosecution might be “unduly cautious,” why limit absolute immunity to him? If the Court wants to facilitate bold action, limiting immunity to him alone could mean that bold action will never extend beyond the Oval Office door.

Next, we must always remember that the president has the power to pardon anyone who violates federal criminal law, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During his first administration, Trump pardoned or granted clemency to military members accused or convicted of war crimes. Given that track record, it’s likely that he would pardon anyone who commits a military offense pursuant to his orders.

Finally, if criminal law doesn’t apply to the president when he exercises his core constitutional authority, it is no wonder that some in uniform might question: can any order he issues to the military be considered “unlawful?” To make matters even more confusing, shortly after his second inauguration, Trump seized the opportunity to fill this Court-created legal void by issuing an executive order stating that only the “President and the Attorney General … shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch.” In other words, for the armed forces, the law is what Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi say it is.

Americans who cling to the hope that the military will constrain the president’s excesses by disobeying his unlawful orders must recognize that in addition to the confused legal landscape, U.S. military personnel face an unprecedented tsunami of executive actions intended and designed to secure absolute and unquestioning military obedience. Hegseth’s admonition to America’s senior military leaders at Quantico to “do the honorable thing and resign” if his words made their “heart[s] sink,” made it clear that any act of what he considers disloyalty or dissent will be crushed.

Firing the Judge Advocates General of the Army and Air Force was a signal to the armed forces that the law will no longer constrain military operations. Sending 600 JAGs to serve as immigration judges will further thin the ranks of military attorneys available to help commanders and other affected personnel distinguish lawful from unlawful orders.

Targeting suspected “narcotrafficker” boats transiting between Venezuela and points north, reportedly killing 21 people to date, without a plausible legal justification has further eroded the idea that military operations must be conducted in lawful ways.

The subtext in these and many future military decisions, actions, and operations has been and will likely be: the law is what the president says it is.

The Law is Still the Law

If disobeying unlawful orders is no longer a clear legal option or predictable outcome, what is to be done?

First, every military leader, whether in attendance at the Quantico photo op or not, must understand that the law is still the law, even if the Court is willing to exempt the president from its consequences. Rather than maintaining a visible distance from their JAGs, who are increasingly being treated as irrelevant, commanders must proactively seek their legal advice.

For their part, JAGs must understand that the administration’s efforts to marginalize them has ironically underscored their importance. The only way the armed forces can continue to operate in a democratic society is if they understand what the law says and where it applies. If the law as it appears in the Constitution, statute, regulation, and judicial decisions conflicts with the law as the president has defined it or with orders issued in his name, JAGs need to identify, document, and report those conflicts. This is their duty as officers, attorneys, and citizens.

If commanders are ordered to engage in acts or operations affected by conflicting legal interpretations, they must first find a way to achieve stated objectives within the bounds of international and domestic law as commonly understood, not as the president has egregiously misinterpreted them. If that’s not possible, they must speak up, put their concerns in writing, and be willing to resign if necessary.

Lest any commanders or JAGs be lulled by the recent confusion over lawful and unlawful orders into believing that obeying orders commonly regarded as unlawful will be rewarded, not punished, they should understand that their careers, liberty, and honor are not the only ones at stake. The troops they lead are watching. Commanders and JAGs must model proper behavior, to include respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.

Finally, former and retired military leaders need to speak out. Understanding that retired regular officers remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, many will consider the risks too great. Those who do speak out do so for many reasons, not the least of which is their ongoing commitment to the current generation of leaders they have shaped and led. Speaking out professionally and respectfully is a proper way to support the generations of men and women who have succeeded us in uniform.

Our military is and must remain capable of lethality. But lethality and honor must coexist in a democratic society’s armed forces. Making that coexistence a reality today is as great a challenge as any our nation has faced.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2237900419.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:58:13.201876

President

Arab American Institute

If US President Donald Trump really wants to earn a Nobel Peace Prize, he’s going to need to do better than his 20-point “Comprehensive Plan to End Gaza’s Conflict.” While in his characteristic style of exaggeration, Mr. Trump called the release of his plan “one of the greatest days in human history,” poring over Arab, Israeli, and US press reveals that most analysts are not inclined to see it that way.

After reading commentaries by writers across the board what is most striking is how widely divergent their views are toward Mr. Trump’s effort. While a few in all three regions express hope that the plan represents a pathway to peace, there’s a significant group of Israelis, Arabs, and Americans who see it as flawed and dangerous, albeit for different reasons.

Israeli hardliners, for example, suggest that if Mr. Trump’s 20-point plan were implemented, it will inevitably lead to the creation of a Palestinian state that will pose a mortal threat to Israel’s security. Meanwhile, a sizable body of Arabs express the concern that, if followed, Trump’s plan will make Israel’s occupation permanent, resulting in the dissolution of the Palestinian cause. In fact, the only issues on which there is agreement are that the plan would stop the further devastation in Gaza and allow for the return of Israeli hostages and some Palestinian prisoners.

The reasons behind this wide range of interpretations about the plan’s intentions are many: the Arabs’ well-earned lack of trust in both Trump and Netanyahu; the belief of hardline ideological Israelis that Netanyahu will do whatever it takes to remain prime minister; the deliberate vagueness of most of the plan’s key points; and, especially galling for Palestinians, the fact that they were handed the plan as a fait accompli without having been asked to provide input and told to accept it or, as Mr. Trump put it, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.”

Of all of these factors, it’s the vagueness that is problematic for all sides. Israeli hardliners, for example, fret over the mention of an Israeli withdrawal, the presence of Arab peacekeepers, Palestinian police, and the possible return of the PA (which, in their minds, means a link between the West Bank and Gaza leading to a Palestinian state).

Palestinians, on the other hand, reading the document closely, see that none of these provisions are guaranteed. And while there is mention of a phased Israeli withdrawal, the plan provides for Israeli forces to remain in a security perimeter inside Gaza. For Palestinians this means a continuation of the two-decades-long stranglehold Israel has had over all access into and egress from Gaza. They see this plan as too focused on Israeli security, with little regard for justice and Palestinian security.

Another glaring problem is the lack of definition of terms and an enforcement mechanism that will ensure that the terms of the plan are implemented. What, for example, is the definition of the “technocratic apolitical Palestinian committee” that is to be created to run day-to-day operations in Gaza? Will its members be vetted by the Trump-led board? Will the Israelis be able to veto members? And, without any clarity on these points, will this committee be viewed as having legitimacy by Palestinians? And finally, without a defined neutral mechanism for enforcement, will the US allow Israel to act in Gaza as they have with regard to the ceasefires in Lebanon and Syria—where they act as the sole arbiter and enforcer of the agreements? (Their interpretation of ceasefire is apparently “you cease, while we continue to fire.”)

The plan mentions an economic development plan to attract foreign investment that is to be designed by experts who have helped “birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East” and a special economic zone with preferred tariffs. But one is hard pressed to understand the relevance of all of this to the plight and immediate needs of Palestinians, which must take precedence over fantasy cities of the future.

There is some detail provided with regard to Hamas members’ decommissioning their weapons, pledging to commit to peaceful coexistence, and the formation of an International Stabilization Force in Gaza. But what’s not clear is how this will be administered. And while our polls make clear that Palestinians in Gaza have had enough of this war and Hamas, they also express the desire to be governed by a national unity coalition of Palestinians, and want accountability for the crimes committed by the Israeli forces.

The bottom line is that far from being “one of the great days in human history,” the Trump plan is just a start. It may end the bombing and return those held captive, but in order to lead to peace, there must be a great deal more discussion that adds flesh to the bones of the plan. That will require openness and trust on all sides. That said, the following are essential.

First, Hamas should accept the Trump Plan, even while stating their concerns and objections. Continuing the conflict is (and has long been) a dead end. Hamas cannot and should not be the arbiter of the Palestinian future. Too many lives have been lost and many more shattered. The fighting must end. Second, Arabs and other nations must insist that Israelis be held accountable for the crimes they have committed. They can’t be brushed aside. Third, with a ceasefire agreed to by all sides, the massive influx of aid and support that Palestinians will require should commence. Fourth, working from the outline provided by the Trump plan, negotiations should begin, with serious Palestinian input at all levels to flesh out the details that can resolve unanswered questions. Fifth, if the president wants to earn his place in history, he must be willing to crack the whip requiring Israel to adhere to whatever terms are established. And finally, for this to be prize-worthy, the whip-cracking must also be applied to the West Bank and East Jerusalem—and not only with regard to annexation. If peace is to be achieved, settlement expansion, land confiscation, home demolitions, raids, and rampages by settlers must end. These behaviors have weakened the credibility of the PA, won greater support for Hamas, and prepared the ground for even greater conflict.

The Trump plan, with its focus on Israel’s security and vague assurances to Palestinians, succeeded in getting Netanyahu and Hamas on board, each side with their own reservations. If it is to lead to peace, there is hard work ahead.

As the U. S. Supreme Court starts its 2025-26 term Monday, Oct. 6, the justices will be deciding, among other matters, which litigants are entitled to bring suit, using the doctrine of standing to determine who’s in and who’s not.

The concept of legal standing is well-known to nearly all lawyers, and even to many lay people as well. It consists of the requirement that a litigant asserting a claim must have a sufficient, legally cognizable interest or stake in the outcome of a case to warrant proceeding with a lawsuit.

The U. S. Supreme Court is fond of using this device from time-to-time to avert ruling on the merits of a case, a tenet that Chief Justice Roberts occasionally espouses during oral argument and high court rulings.

A dozen recent cases provide a broad perspective on current and prospective standing suits.

Issue illustrated

An illustration of the standing issue during the court’s 2024-25 term was the granting of a Trump administration’s emergency appeal staying a lower court ruling ordering reinstatement of some 16,000 fired federal government probationary employees on grounds that posture of the nine nonprofit organizations bringing the suit was “insufficient to support [their] standing” in U.S. Office of Personnel Management v. American Federation of Government Employees, 145 S.Ct. 1914 (April 8, 2025) (per curiam).

But two months later the justices found standing for fuel manufacturers challenging a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency to the state of California allowing it to impose stringent restrictions on vehicle emissions.

The justices rejected another standing challenge in Diamond Alternative Energy LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency, 145 S.Ct. 2121 (June 20, 2025) on grounds that as “targets,” the fuel makers should not be “locked out” from contesting regulations that may impose harm upon them in the future. This was a decision in which the oral argument portended a ruling that fuel manufacturers have standing to challenge heightened California state regulation of emissions for vehicles and electric cars imposed under a Biden era waiver from lesser federal anti-pollution standards, a holdover case from the prior administration that the Trump administration somewhat surprisingly continued to defend, ostensibly to avoid a recent ruling giving greater latitude to judicial review of governmental-imposed restrictions.

The decision that drew a sharp dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that the court was exhibiting an obedience to “moneyed interests” rather than “ordinary citizens,” which she characterized as a continuation of the tribunal’s undue favoritism of “corporate interests.” Some observers scoffed at her concerns, noting that a couple of days earlier it was revealed that she has been paid nearly $3 million from a “moneyed” publisher for her autobiography “Lovely One: A Memoir.”

The ruling, however, might be moot as Congress has enacted a measure rescinding the EPA’s waiver-granting authority.

But standing, or lack of it, is a device occasionally invoked by the Supreme Court in declining to rule on the merits of cases, as it did last year in dodging and dismissing the challenge by a group of anti-abortion physicians to the accessibility of the mifepristone pill used by many women for induced abortions. FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 692 U.S. 367 (2024). That litigation has been revived, however, and is now pending in federal court in Texas as a trio of Republican state attorneys general have taken up the cudgel. Chief Justice Roberts is a frequent questioner at oral argument of the standing of claimants, although others occasionally chime in, too.

Minnesota matters

Those cases stem from a Federal judicial requirement in Article III of the Constitution that courts hear “Cases and Controversies” has been interpreted to incorporate the concept of legal standing. There is no similar provision in Minnesota law, but common law incorporates the same principle in matters arising in this state.

A pair of significant rulings by the Minnesota Supreme Court reached similar results, including one ruling earlier this year and a prior one last year regarding this doctrine.

Although arising in different contexts, the cases both centered on the subject of standing. One involved the restoration of voting rights to felons and the other concerned a collective bargaining issue for Minneapolis school teachers.

However, the outcomes were the same in both cases, with the Supreme Court dismissing the lawsuits based on lack of standing by taxpayers.

Ballot battle

A battle over the right of felons to cast ballots was resolved in favor of a Minnesota statute enacted in 2023 that restored voting rights to most felons after completion of their incarceration in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Hunt, 10 N.W.3d 163 (2024). In its first ruling of the year, the justices unanimously rebuffed a challenge to the law brought by a conservative-oriented advocacy group that frequently challenges voting rights issues.

In a unanimous decision, with two newly appointed jurists not participating, the court upheld the measure, Minn. Stat. § 201014, subd. 2a, entitled the Minnesota Re-Enfranchisement Act, which is estimated to apply to about 60,000 Minnesotans.

The lawsuit was brought by a group of three individual taxpayers and the association to which they belong, Minnesota Voters Alliance (MVA), which has contested a number of voting rights measures over the years, some successful.

This was not one of them because the Ramsey County District Court dismissed the lawsuit, and the Supreme Court, hearing the suit on an accelerated review bypassing the Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Natalie Hudson, affirmed the lower court determination.

Without addressing the merits, the court held that the claimants lacked standing as taxpayers because that indulgence only applies when a dispute is centered on expenditure of public funds.

Reviewing the history of taxpayer standing in Minnesota, the chief justice noted that “binding precedent on taxpayer standing is currently limited to issues of illegal expenditures.” Because the re-enfranchisement statute “does not contemplate government expenditures,” the concerns raised by the taxpayers “are incidental” to their claims for relief and, therefore, they lack standing. A contrary ruling would, the chief justice said, “render the limitations on taxpayer standing to become meaningless” by allowing unrestrained challenges to government actions that involve incidental expenditures, which are disallowed because a “taxpayer cannot manufacture standing by pointing to expenditures that are incidental to implementing the law.”

Because taxpayers lack standing, “it logically follows that their association … does not have associational standing.”

Another associational standing case was addressed this summer in Orono Oaks Volunteer Road Assoc. v. Orono Oaks Assoc., Inc., 2025 WL 2318221 (Minn. App. Aug. 11, 2025)(nonprecedential). The suit was brought by an association consisting of all homeowners in a subdivision that was established to address the failure of a nonprofit association tasked with maintenance of roads in the subdivision. The Hennepin County District Court dismissed the lawsuit for damages due to the neglected maintenance, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

The homeowner’s association bringing the case lacked standing since the claimed damages were “specific” to the individual property owner and cannot be pursued by the association, along with denying a request for a receivership.

Reimbursement ruling

A taxpayer challenge to a provision in a collective bargaining agreement between the union representing teachers in the Minneapolis public school system and the school district also faltered on grounds of lack of standing in Clapp v. Sayles Adams, 15 N.W.3d 648 (Minn. Jan. 8, 2025).

In its first ruling of this year, the court, again unanimously in a decision written by Justice Karl Procacinni, rejected the claim by a taxpayer who lived in Minneapolis seeking to eradicate a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that included preferential provisions for a racial and ethnic teachers, which the claimant asserted violated the Equal Protection clause of Article I, section 2, of the Minnesota Constitution.

The Hennepin County District Court dismissed the case, but the appellate court reversed, leading the Supreme Court to take the opportunity to apply the requirements for taxpayer standing … that [was] recently clarified” in the Hunt case last year. True to his word, Justice Procacinni, did “resolve this case based on standing,” relying upon “the recent clarification requirements for taxpayer standing in Hunt.” In so doing, the court concluded that the “central dispute in this case did not involve unlawful disbursement of public funds and, therefore, the claimant lacks taxpayer standing.”

Standing sustained

But in another case involving public school teachers in Minnesota, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed taxpayer standing in Huizenga v. Independent School District No. 11, 44 F.4th 806 (8th Cir. 2022). The case was brought by three residents in Anoka County against a school district and the union representing teachers, concerning a teacher reimbursement plan contained in the collective bargaining agreement, which the claimants alleged violated constitutional statutory provisions.

In a per curiam decision, reversing a ruling of U.S. District Court Judge Jerry Blackwell in Minnesota, the court held that the Anoka residents had “adequately alleged that the school district taxpayers” and further identified a “municipal action” that caused injury to them, consisting of the expenditure of tax revenue by a public school district on the “allegedly illegal action” under the bargaining agreement, because the teachers are given up to 100 days of paid leave, which their union does not fully reimburse the school district for those expenses. Because Judge Blackwell had not addressed “preliminary injunction factors,” the case was sent back for determination whether injunctive relief was appropriate.

On remand, Judge Blackwell last year decided it was not and dismissed the case, again, for lack of standing under Article III of the Federal Constitution on grounds that the lawsuit did not demonstrate that municipal taxpayer funds were spent on the contested activity relied on “unclear data and unfounded assumptions, [with] … no actual expenses.” He explained that the lawsuit was premised on an argument that is “the same kind made in households every day — that wages should be higher and expenses should be lower.” That government spending “should be more, less, or allocated differently,” constituted an insufficient basis to sustain standing for the three claimant taxpayers. 727 F. Supp. 3rd 812 (D. Minn. 2024).

The organization supporting the lawsuit, the Upper Midwest Law Center, expressed that it was “disappointed” in the ruling and pledged to appeal it, again, in its commitment to “defending constitutional rights,” which it promptly did last spring, taking it up again to the Circuit Court, which again reversed Judge Blackwell. Huizenga v. Independent School District #11, 2025 WL 2302432 (August 11, 2025) (nonprecedential). By a 2-1 vote, an appellate panel ruled that two of the taxpayers who still lived in the school district had standing to proceed with the case (the other one had moved out) because they established a “direct injury” due to the “direct expenditure of district funds” to pay for substitute teachers to fill in while full-timers were engaged in the permissible non-teaching activities allowed under the union contract. The case, thus, bounced back to Judge Blackwell for a third look at the litigation, a tripling down of the Groundhog Day phenomenon. See Perspectives, “Groundhog Day recalls litigation do-overs” in the January 27, 2025, edition of Minnesota Lawyer.

Latest lawsuits

But Judge Blackwell fared better this summer in another standing dispute in Pickle v. Minnesota Association of Townships, 2025WL 1793838 (8th Cir. June 20, 2025)(nonprecedential), the 8th Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds of lack of standing by Judge Blackwell of the most recent of a multitude of legal actions by a group opposed to actions of a nonprofit organization of township governments. But the court held that the disposition should be without prejudice, rather than with prejudice, because the absence of standing constitutes a jurisdictional defect.

In a case decided a week earlier, the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that a sole shareholder of a consulting company aggrieved by unreasonable expenses in connection with a business project could not sue “in an individual capacity” to seek reimbursement owing to his entity. Levy v. Daily Dental Care, LLC, 2025 WL 1733444 (Minn. App. June 23, 2025)(nonprecedential). The lawsuit could not proceed because the individual owner could not sue for a claimed injury to his company, which alone was entitled to bring the claim.

The summer came to a close with a standing issue that the 8th Circuit bypassed and chose to affirm on other grounds in Swanson v. Hilgers, 2025 WL 2425192 (8th Cir. Aug. 22, 2025). The case was brought by a midwife who challenged various state law regulatory practices that she claimed were violative of her rights and those of her future patients.

But her claim was stillborn at the district court level, which dismissed her claims on the merits and refused to address the prospective patients’ claims on grounds of lack of standing. The circuit court affirmed in the merits, skipping over the standing issue, on grounds that the various challenged licensing restrictions were within the “legitimate interest of protecting health, safety, and welfare.”

To cap off the nine standing suits, the Minnesota Court of Appeals early last month upheld the standing of a labor union-related organization to sue a business offering consumers coupons and access to prescription drugs discounts on grounds that the arrangements violated Minn. Stat. § 325F.784, which governs prescription drug discount cards although it did not claim any actual damages suffered by the group. Affirming a ruling of the McCleod County District Court, the Court of Appeals upheld the standing of the organization to bring that suit because the “plain and unambiguous language” of the statute permits a suit to be brought without the claimant alleging it that it has suffered “an injury in fact” due to misleading or other improper consumer practices, directed to consumers in Minnesota Teamsters Service Bureau v. GoodRx, Inc., 2025 WL 2502013 (Minn. App. Sept. 2, 2025)(nonprecedential).

Suspension standing

As the summer drew to a close the Minnesota Court of Appeals addressed standing, in a criminal case, State v. Peters, 2025 WL 2586840 (Minn. App. Sept. 8, 2025)(nonprecedential). The Polk County District Court’s dismissal of a suppressed motion in a drug possession an driving while impaired (DWI) case on grounds that the defendant lacked standing to challenge his seizure in his car by police in East Grand Forks was reversed. The district court rejected the motion because the defendant was employed in Minnesota in violation of an order from next door in North Dakota, where he lived, while leaving the state when he was on probation without court permission, which he lacked.

Lacking permission, he also lacked standing, the Polk County judge reasoned.

But the reasoning lacked a viable basis, according to the Court of Appeals, which reversed and remanded. It reasoned that the lower court’s rationale was “misguided” because the resident it ruled upon involved a seizure in a home, rather than as here, a vehicle on a public street.

The issue of standing was dispositive last month in a decision by the 8th Circuit rejecting a challenge to the Minnesota “anti-captive audience” law, Minn. Stat. §181.531 in Minnesota Chapter of Associated Builders and Contractors v. Ellison, 2025 WL 2526268_(8th Cir. 2025)(nonprecedential). Reversing a ruling of U. S. District Court Judge Patrick Schlitz, the Court by a 2-1 vote, over the dissent of Judge James Loken of Minnesota, held that the claimant business groups could not pursue a pre-enforcement challenge to the 2023 measure known as the Employer – Sponsored Meetings and Communications Act (ESMCA), one of a dozen in the country, that bars adverse action by employers against employees who decline to receive communications or participate in meetings in which management expound on political “political or religious matters,” including labor union- related issues.

The controlling two members of the panel dismissed claims grounded on the first amendment right of freedom of expression and federal labor law preemption against Gov. Tim Walz and the commissioner of the Department Of Labor And Industry. A claim against Attorney General Keith Ellison also was dismissed on grounds of sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment because he has declared that he will not enforce the law, which negates any “standing“ by the claimants to maintain the statutory challenge.

These varied cases reflect that, regardless of the merits of a lawsuit, claimants must often overcome standing barriers in order to pursue them.

A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.
“That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.” The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is spending millions of dollars on television advertising in select metro areas around the country, an Associated Press tally found, aimed at recruiting local officers frustrated with their cities' restrictions on immigration enforcement into President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.

“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations. The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE — a 10-fold increase in its current budget — as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as the result of Congress’ failure to pass a spending measure last week, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, the Trump administration’s top priority, is still flush with cash.

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,"" according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington, D.C. Adding to the list a week ago: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of Friday, total spending on the ads had topped $5.7 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in the past week, $794,084, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an AP email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a Sept. 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city's mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city's Police Officers Association, said he'd seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city's police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.""

The government shutdown could dampen ICE's recruitment hopes, he said.

""They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,"" he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Capt. John Walker said it's too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city's recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It's the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who's in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That's all this is, strengthening the belief that they're doing something.”

The ad blitz comes as law enforcement departments around the country are struggling to meet staffing demands.

This is the second batch of deportees that the Trump administration has sent to Eswatini as part of its hard-line approach towards immigration.

The 10 have been ""securely accommodated"", and posed no threat to the public, Eswatini's prison department said in a statement.

Eswatini human rights lawyer Mzwandile Masuku told the BBC he was ""shocked and dismayed"" that the government had taken in the group, despite an ongoing court case against the arrival of five deportees in July.

The US had described the five - from Jamaica, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen - as ""depraved monsters"".

The Jamaican has since been repatriated to his country of origin, while another two were expected to be repatriated soon, Eswatini's government says.

In a statement on Sunday, the government said it would take in 11 deportees following an agreement with the US ""to cooperate in this manner"".

It did not explain why only 10 had arrived.

Their names have not been made public.

Destination: Africa - is it legal for US to deport foreign criminals to the continent

The BBC reported in September that the Trump administration had told Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man at the centre of a long-running immigration row, he could be deported to the southern African kingdom.

The administration alleges that he was a member of a transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then returned to the US where he was detained and charged with human smuggling. He pleaded not guilty.

A US federal charge ruled on Friday that Mr Garcia's prosecution could be for ""vindictive"" reasons, and he would hear more evidence before reaching a final decision.

The BBC has asked Eswatini government acting spokesperson Thabile Mdluli whether or not he was among the latest group to be deported.

In an earlier statement, she said the deportees would be kept in a ""secured area separate from the public, while arrangements are made for their return to their countries of origin"".

Their arrival comes a day before a court case against the deportations is set to resume in the main city, Mbabane.

Mr Masuku, who represents civil society groups challenging the deal, said he would have expected the government to ""respect the court process and await its ruling"" before accepting more deportees.

In September, campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had seen the agreement between the Eswatini and US governments.

It provides for Eswatini to accept up to 160 deportees in exchange for $5.1m (£3.79m) from the US to build its ""border and migration management capacity"", HRW said.

The Southern African Litigation Centre (SALC) - along with other civil society groups - argues that the government's decision amounts to ""executive over-reach"" and Eswatini's constitution states that such agreements should be reached with parliamentary consent, something that did not happen in this instance.

Activists also protested against the deal outside the US embassy when the first deportees arrived.

The civic groups say the deal is secretive and an example of ""democratic regression"", 20 years after Eswatini adopted a constitution to give more of a say to parliament in a country where the king has long wielded absolute power.

""We would have expected this milestone to reflect a maturation of our democracy - stronger rule of law, greater accountability, and clearer separation of powers,"" the SALC's Melusi Simelane told the BBC.

The government is defending the case, saying it acted within its powers and that the constitution makes allowances for it to reach such agreements with foreign governments.

Some Eswatini MPs had previously raised concerns about the deal in parliament, but Prime Minister Russell Dlamini said it had been handled at ""top clearance level"".

The deal also alarmed neighbouring South Africa, which expressed fears that the deportees could cross into the country via their porous border.

Ms Mdluli tried to allay the fears by saying the deportees were being held in solitary confinement in a secure facility.

The Trump administration has adopted a foreign policy approach of prioritizing economic and security relations with countries where interests converge. This strategy may be initially popular with some foreign leaders who think their countries could gain more from trade than they did from aid, but it is already clashing with the administration’s credo of “America First.” This tension is most visible in U.S-Africa relations.

The Trump administration’s early push for a commercial diplomacy strategy for Africa that prioritizes trade over aid was welcomed by many African leaders. These leaders have long called for the United States to recognize the African continent as a commercial partner, and not only as an aid recipient. The United States, of course, has a long history of commercial diplomacy in Africa. The Trump administration is trying to distinguish its approach, especially for its domestic constituencies, by emphasizing trade benefits, private sector investments, and bankable partnerships for U.S. businesses, while also seeking to persuade African leaders of the potential for economic growth. Recently retired Ambassador Troy Fitrell, the State Department’s senior bureau official for Africa who helped craft the administration’s policy, told an audience in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, in May 2025 that the administration’s strategy would be implemented in close partnership with U.S companies, African governments, and other stakeholders to create conditions for economic growth on the continent.

While the U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region.

Africa’s growing strategic and geopolitical relevance—given the potential of its burgeoning population and its store of the critical minerals needed to serve the globe’s high-tech needs—offers clear areas where U.S interests converge with opportunities, and a commercial diplomacy strategy could help achieve alignment. But foreign policy does not operate in a vacuum: All foreign policy is inherently domestic, and under this administration, domestic priorities such as supporting U.S. businesses strongly influence the foreign policy agenda. This creates challenges in the conception and execution of a commercial diplomacy strategy for Africa. Perhaps two areas where this tension is most visible are trade protectionism and immigration reform.

How Have Trump’s Policies Impacted Africa? How Is Africa Responding?

Trade Protectionism

The Trump administration’s April 2, 2025, “Liberation Day” Executive Order 14257, which proposed significant tariffs aimed at addressing trade deficits and promoting U.S. economic independence, undermines the administration’s own trade-over-aid agenda in Africa. The order (since modified more than once) initially imposed baseline 10 percent tariffs on 29 African countries and placed higher tariffs on 20 more African countries, reaching up to 50 percent for Lesotho—the second-highest rate after China. Lesotho, one of Africa’s smallest economies and greatly reliant on textile exports to the United States, declared a state of disaster in its textile industry before Trump announced a 90-day pause. Following the administration’s modification of reciprocal tariff rates on July 31, Lesotho’s new duty on imports decreased to 15 percent, which has provided some relief. But about 12,000 textile jobs in Lesotho hang in the balance. The country is now courting buyers from other markets for its goods.

Trump also has imposed a 30 percent tariff on select South African goods and has threatened a 10 percent increase in tariffs for nations aligned with the BRICS bloc of major emerging economies. These sets of tariffs impact two of Africa’s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, along with many smaller countries. The 30 percent tariff on South Africa is expected to significantly impact the country’s job market, especially in the automotive parts industry, which relies heavily on duty-free exports to the United States. Nigeria’s tariff rate, now at 15 percent, may rise by an additional 10 percent given it recently joined BRICS in January 2025 as a partner country, just before Trump took office with a view of BRICS’ policies as “anti-American.”

Although the Trump administration ultimately modified some of its tariffs on Africa, the levies have caused uncertainty and panic for many African countries that rely heavily on trade with the United States. The tariffs have shaken African economies and raised significant doubts about the intent of the United States’ commercial diplomacy strategy, with some questioning whether it is only about securing minerals from the continent and not a mutually beneficial partnership.

The Trump administration has demonstrated a preference for a transactional foreign policy approach on the continent; for example, earlier this year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) offered exclusive mineral rights for U.S. companies in exchange for U.S. security assistance against the M23 rebel group, a paramilitary force backed by neighboring Rwanda. The request influenced a subsequent peace deal between the DRC and Rwanda, brokered by the United States, that apparently would grant rights to certain critical minerals to foreign investors, including from the United States. The declaration of principles for peace that was signed in June 2025 by the foreign ministers of the DRC and Rwanda purportedly is intended to provide economic incentives for all parties involved through what State Department Senior Advisor on Africa Massad Boulos described as a “regional economic integration framework.”

The U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region.

The quest to secure critical minerals appears to be a key focus of this administration, playing a significant role in Trump’s early overtures to Ukraine as well. And while the U.S.-facilitated peace agreement for the DRC and Rwanda is seen as a step in the right direction, the verdict is still out on whether this process can restore peace in the region. Notably, the presidents of the warring countries were absent from the June signing, which included an Oval Office appearance with the two foreign ministers; a key rebel group was not involved in those talks; and significant hurdles to implementation remain. Without an enabling environment of stability and security, it would be difficult for U.S businesses to operate in the region.

The tariffs also placed a question mark over the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which has given African countries tariff-free access to U.S. markets for 25 years. AGOA expired in September 2025, and at the time of this writing, there is no clear indication of whether and how it will be renewed, a step that would have to be taken by Congress. Many in the Trump administration have noted its significance, and Trump himself, when asked about AGOA during the July 2025 summit he conducted with five African presidents—from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal—said that he would “look at” extending the trade pact. But many African leaders doubt the prospects of AGOA’s renewal, given its no-tariff regime for some goods.

Meanwhile, China is already Africa’s biggest trading partner, giving nearly the entire continent tariff-free access to its markets: In June 2025, China removed tariffs for 53 African countries. That will help expand the already notable gap between Chinese and U.S. trade figures with Africa—Africa’s trade in goods with China rose 6.1 percent in 2024 to $295 billion compared with $72 billion of goods traded with the United States.

In response to this uncertain environment and to counter Trump’s tariffs, African countries are doubling down on efforts to leverage their flagship free trade initiative, the African Continental Free Trade Area. That initiative, which began trading in 2021 to bring the continent’s 1.4 billion people in more than 50 countries into a single market, has been slow in implementation. While 49 countries have ratified the agreement, fewer than half are actively trading under its umbrella—though the initiative has still seen some progress. In the meantime, African nations are expanding trade ties with China, the European Union, and Persian Gulf states.

Immigration Reform

The Trump administration’s immigration policies also undermine its commercial diplomacy strategy and economic partnership narrative with Africa. Washington has imposed sweeping visa and travel restrictions under the premise that tightening them protects U.S. national security. But these moves significantly harm many African countries by, among other impacts, hindering the travel required for trade and investment, distracting African leaders who must deal with the sociopolitical effects, and poisoning the atmosphere between U.S. and African leaders.

Distracting from economic issues, the administration’s July summit with the five African leaders included a push to have African countries accept third-country nationals deported from the United States, hardly creating the atmosphere of mutual respect needed to develop strong economic relations. Furthermore, the United States has imposed complete or partial visa bans on at least 19 countries, 10 of which are in Africa. All this comes on top of Trump’s divisive new policy of admitting white Afrikaner South Africans who claim persecution because of discrimination and violence as refugees.

Multiple African officials have condemned the punitive Trump administration measures as unacceptable and counterproductive. Nigeria, for example, said that while it is eager to strengthen trade ties with the United States, the travel restrictions are a major hinderance. Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar publicly rejected the Trump administration’s pressure for the country to accept third-nation asylum seekers, saying the country has “enough problems of our own” and will not cave to U.S. coercion to take in deportees with no ties to Nigeria.

The Trump administration’s new immigration policies also severely restrict student visas, with many African youth heavily impacted; even those already studying in the United States are being cautioned against leaving because they may not be able to return. This is another case of the Trump administration shooting its foreign trade and investment policy in the wallet, so to speak, as Africa’s youth boom is becoming a major economic force globally. The World Economic Forum has reported that “by 2035, there will be more young Africans entering the workforce each year than in the rest of the world combined.” And China already has a significant numbers advantage over the United States in attracting the best and brightest of them to its education system.

Implications and Recommendations for the United States

The United States must rightfully prioritize its domestic national interests. But foreign policy interests are inextricably intertwined with domestic priorities in today’s globally interdependent world, even for the economically powerful United States. It would be shortsighted, to say the least, to hamper potentially beneficial and even lucrative economic ties abroad with counterproductive measures that might undermine the goals of trade and economic growth. The Trump administration risks falling further into that trap by failing to balance these interests in a way that helps, not hurts, Americans—not to mention, in this case, Africans as well. The administration’s much-touted commercial diplomacy is at stake.

As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, the United States must clearly identify why it wants to—and why it must—engage with African countries.

As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, the United States must clearly identify why it wants to—and why it must—engage with African countries, and it cannot just be to displace China with more of the same. That would be of little interest to African leaders or Africa’s citizens. Why shift from one usurious “partner” to another?

Instead, the Trump administration would find more economic success by understanding fully how it can distinguish itself in the eyes of potential partners. As noted, China already surpasses the United States in trade with African countries and is also increasing its investment in the soft-power approaches that the United States has been using for years, such as in education. And now the Trump administration is eviscerating many of the soft-power tools that gave the country a competitive edge in Africa, not only by restricting immigration and educational exchange but also by dismantling major institutions such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the source of extensive U.S.-Africa economic ties. Among other initiatives, the gutting of USAID took down the 2013 Power Africa project, which aimed to help the continent get up to par on energy production—crucial to any economic development. Another program that fell to the axe was Prosper Africa, a promising initiative created under the first Trump administration that facilitated the creation of the government-backed but private U.S.-Africa Trade Desk to further enhance trade cooperation. The Trump administration has also suspended the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, which once helped reduce risks in early-stage investments and could have been instrumental in ensuring a successful commercial diplomacy strategy. And while the administration retained its Africa bureau in a recent reorganization of the State Department, it has considered significantly scaling back embassy representation on the continent.

Some of the best-performing government agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) are now under severe budget-cutting pressure. Despite this, the MCC seems to be rebounding with the recent announcement of a $300 million electrification grant for Cote D’Ivoire. Investments like this by the MCC are crucial to deliver the infrastructure needed for successful trade and investment and ensuring that its high-profile senior-level delegations to the continent are not simply symbolic. The administration has signaled that it plans to rely much more on financial institutions such as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation—also facing reauthorization this year—which provides financing and other assistance for development projects, and the U.S. Export-Import (EXIM) Bank, which provides credit to support U.S. trade. The EXIM Bank, for example, announced in August a $66 million guarantee for a small Washington, D.C.–based exporter of equipment for a new national data center in Côte d’Ivoire. But even then, the announcement makes clear that a key motivator is that the offer “displaces competition” from China. The project could nevertheless be promising, if it is accompanied by the right personnel on the ground—after all, people equal policy.

Similarly, the administration still has a chance to correct or offset its travel restrictions and tariff decisions and its extensive cuts to foreign assistance and diplomacy in ways that support the president’s agenda of commercial diplomacy with Africa, rather than weakening U.S. influence around the globe. The reorganization of the State Department, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in May 2025, should be aimed at ensuring that qualified personnel with experience on the continent are in decisionmaking positions for any offices or programs related to Africa. The department needs advanced skills and experience to successfully navigate complex relationships, not only with overseas partners but also with other U.S. government agencies that could be helpful if the president is really serious about an agenda that prioritizes trade over aid. Any budget deliberations with Congress for FY 2026 should ensure sufficient funding to keep embassies staffed and running and for the State Department to advance these priorities. Renewing AGOA should be another priority—it is not a perfect tool, but it offers the possibility to innovate and create more jobs and opportunities for both the United States and Africa.

In pursuing their commercial diplomacy, Trump and his cabinet should ask—and answer—a question honestly: What makes the United States different from China? The perceptions of citizens everywhere are shaped by their lived experiences, and Africans’ perceptions of China remain relatively positive despite some recent decreases in Chinese funding to the continent. The most recent Afrobarometer survey of 30 African countries finds that 60 percent of Africans hold a positive view of China’s economic and political influence, compared with 53 percent who say the same of the United States. Five years earlier, the two global powers were neck-in-neck, at 59 percent for China and 58 percent for the United States.",https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2025-10/GettyImages-2224312581_cropped.jpg?VersionId=iL6bdy8.YpsqMfu0HWT5SyI4ZXGAG1zr,N,,2025-10-06 11:58:33.699253

The group of agents was conducting a routine patrol on the city’s South Side on Saturday “when they were attacked and rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

The agents were on patrol about 15 miles from the anti-ICE protests that had been simmering for several days outside the ICE processing center in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when the attack began.

Once they attempted to flee their trapped vehicle, a woman — later found to be toting a semi-automatic weapon — attempted to run the officers down, but was shot by police.

Local cops were initially prepared to help the agents, but were ordered to stand down by the chief of patrol, according to shocking dispatch audio transmissions.

“Younger male Hispanic wearing all black … wanted for the hit-and-run, this guy fled from the scene,” a female dispatcher blares in response to a call for help from the surrounded ICE agents on audio shared by ExxAlerts.

“When the offending vehicle crashed, they ran the federal agent off the road, they fled on foot westbound.”

A male voice then comes on the radio channel, telling the dispatcher to direct officers to head to the scene and “stay put” a few blocks away and await further instruction, which she relays.

A few seconds later, the male voice is heard again, saying tersely: “Per the chief of patrol: Clear everybody out, we’re not responding over there.”

The female dispatcher then tells officers on the way to the distress call, “per the chief of patrol, all units clear out from there, we’re not sending anybody out to that location.”

A male officer responds over the sound of sirens wailing in the background, saying, “We’re going to clear out as soon as we can, we’re like blocked in over here so we’re going to do the best we can to get out of here as soon as we can.”

An internal department memo sent to Chicago cops and obtained by Fox News confirms the shocking reversal.

“PLEASE CHIEF OF PATROL NO UNITS WILL RESPOND TO THIS AS RELATED FROM 04-Oc5-2025/12:34:44…CALLER IS 1 OF APPROX 30 ARMED PATROL AGENTS (ICE) WHO ARE BEING SURROUNDED BY A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE REQUESTING CPD,” the dispatch message read.

The Chicago Police Department disputed the claims, saying its officers were on the scene.

“To clarify misinformation currently circulating, CPD officers did in fact respond to the shooting scene involving federal authorities on Saturday to maintain public safety and traffic control,” the department said in a statement to Fox.

“The Chicago Police Department will always respond to anyone who is being attacked or is under the threat of physical harm,” the department added. “For incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, CPD supervisors will respond to the scene and determine the appropriate course of action in accordance with City law.”

Ten cars had surrounded the federal agents, Trump officials said.

“Today in Chicago, members of our brave law enforcement were attacked — rammed and boxed in by ten vehicles, including an attacker with a semi-automatic weapon,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X in response to the attack, pledging to send more resources to the crime-ravaged city.

The mob had gathered in the area near 39th Place and South Kedzie Avenue to protest the shooting of the armed woman and was met with tear gas deployed by federal agents, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The latest spate of violence in the Windy City comes after US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” an initiative to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor [JB] Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the department announced in an X post.

Protesters have increasingly used vehicles to attack ICE agents in the Chicago area in recent days, according to DHS, which said agents were targeted twice in such a manner in one day earlier this week.

No officers were injured in the mob attack, and the woman shot defensively by police reportedly drove herself to the hospital to be treated for her wounds.

More than a dozen protesters have been arrested near the ICE facility since Friday, according to Fox News.

Only in this term, he said, will the justices show whether they plan to curb Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power.","When the nine justices of the Supreme Court return to their raised mahogany bench each year on the first Monday of October, it typically marks the end of a three-month stretch of rest and reflection.

But this summer’s traditional recess was anything but a cooling-off period.

Instead, the justices churned through emergency requests from the Trump administration that sharply divided the court along ideological lines, in a reflection of how much President Trump’s agenda has consumed their calendar.

The president’s policies will have an even more central role in the term that begins on Monday, after the justices agreed to take three cases with broad consequences for his agenda. In November, they will hear arguments about the legality of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, a centerpiece of his trade strategy. In December, they will consider Mr. Trump’s efforts to wrest control of independent agencies, and in January, his attempt to fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board.

By the time the term ends in June, there could be others. Already, the administration has asked the court to take up a pair of cases testing the legality of the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, an issue that raises fundamental questions about what it means to be an American.

The result will be a term of generational consequence for the court and the presidency, and a defining one for the legacy of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will mark his 20th year on the bench.

“It’s hard to imagine bigger tests of presidential power than these potentially once-in-a-century separation-of-powers battles,” said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer at the firm Gupta Wessler who frequently argues cases before the justices. “And we’re seeing more than one of them at once.”

Since Mr. Trump took office in January, the court’s conservative majority has repeatedly sided with the administration. But those decisions came in a series of emergency, unsigned orders. Often published without reasoning on what critics call the “shadow docket,” the orders have technically been temporary, addressing whether a challenged policy could be implemented while its legality was tested in court.

But until now, the justices have not squarely addressed the legality of Mr. Trump’s boundary-pushing policies to transform the government.

That will change this term, as the justices confront Mr. Trump’s policies head-on, offering final judgments on whether they are legal, in cases that include oral arguments and decisions with lengthy opinions.

“We’re going to see, among others things, whether the Supreme Court is actually going to say no to Donald Trump on anything,” said Pamela S. Karlan, a co-director of Stanford Law School’s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic and former Justice Department official in the Obama and Biden administrations.

“They’ve tried to dodge and tried to dodge and tried to dodge saying no to him by coming up with procedural ways to say yes to him,” Ms. Karlan said. “But I don’t see how they get out of this term doing it that way.”

Apart from the administration’s cases testing the limits of executive authority, the court will hear a series of other consequential matters, including more politically charged legal battles over gender identity.

Last term, the court divided along ideological lines when it allowed Tennessee to prohibit some medical treatments for transgender youths. On Tuesday, the justices will consider a challenge from a Christian therapist who objected to a Colorado law prohibiting licensed mental health therapists from counseling minors to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.

The court will also hear legal challenges to state laws barring transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports teams.

Major cases that could reshape the election landscape are also on the docket, including one that could result in the justices striking down or severely restraining a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

That case involves a challenge to Louisiana’s voting map, which was adopted following the 2020 census and includes two majority-Black congressional districts.

The justices heard a challenge to the map in the spring. Rather than rule on whether state lawmakers unlawfully emphasized race in drawing the map, as some non-Black residents had argued, the justices announced that they would hear the case again with a more expansive constitutional question. The rare move suggested that some members of the court might be ready to use the case to gut the Voting Rights Act, a pillar of the Civil Rights era that conservatives have been whittling down in recent years.

The justices this week will also hear a challenge to rules on mail-in ballots in Illinois, a case that could open the way for efforts to restrict voting by mail. And later in the term, the court will consider what could become a landmark case on campaign finance regulations — a challenge to federal guardrails that limit political parties from coordinating with candidates to spend money on campaign advertising.

But the heart of the court’s work this term, which by tradition will stretch into late June or early July, is likely to involve Mr. Trump.

The justices have so far issued more than 20 orders in response to emergency applications involving the Trump administration, ruling overwhelmingly in Mr. Trump’s favor in decisions that were technically placeholders.

Their rulings have addressed preliminary questions, such as who has the right to sue and in which court. But the immediate impact of those interim orders has been significant. In recent months, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to withhold billions of dollars in foreign aid funding; to begin dismantling the Education Department; to deport migrants to war-torn countries where they have no connections; and to kick transgender troops out of the military. While the majority’s rulings are often brief, the three liberal justices have issued lengthy and impassioned dissents.

Irv Gornstein, who leads the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown Law School, said it was hard to ignore the court’s overwhelming habit of dividing along ideological lines when issuing emergency orders in the Trump administration’s favor.

Mr. Gornstein added that if those voting patterns hold when the court reaches final decisions about the validity of the administration’s policies, and with other controversial cases on its docket, “we are in for one of the most polarizing terms yet.”

The opening months of the term feature back-to-back tests of the president’s agenda. The justices have fast-tracked review of Mr. Trump’s sweeping tariffs, after a lower court said the president exceeded his authority by invoking a 1970s-era emergency power to tax imports from major trading partners. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act has typically been used to impose sanctions and embargoes against other nations. It does not mention the word tariff.

Some leading conservative and libertarian scholars have said in court filings that the president’s use of the statute to impose tariffs was unlawful, and that the power to tax must remain with Congress. If the justices agree with the lower courts that Mr. Trump improperly invoked the act, the president will be forced to remove that set of tariffs. But the administration is already issuing tariffs under other legal provisions.

In December, the court will examine the president’s power to fire a leader of the Federal Trade Commission, revisiting a 90-year precedent that has allowed Congress to pass laws preventing presidents from removing independent regulators solely over policy disagreements.

Even before Mr. Trump returned to office, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority had taken steps to make it easier for presidents to remove independent agency leaders, signaling it would be receptive to claims of executive power.

In January, the court will consider whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor. The justices have signaled in a separate case that the Fed is uniquely independent, and their decision will have far-reaching implications for the central bank and the U.S. economy.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, cautioned against reading too much into the Supreme Court’s preliminary orders. Only in this term, he said, will the justices show whether they plan to curb Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power.

“That’s why this term is so important. Plenty of folks think that question has already been answered, but the conclusive evidence is still to come,” Mr. Vladeck said.

Jonathan Adler, a law professor at William & Mary who specializes in administrative and constitutional law, said that one reason Mr. Trump had been so successful at the court so far was that his lawyers had been able to cherry-pick which cases to bring to the justices, largely avoiding some of the thornier disputes.

The result, he said, was an “unrepresentative sample.”

The rulings so far “don’t really tell us how the court views the substance of what the administration has been planning,” he said.

Chief Justice Roberts this term will become the fourth-longest-serving chief in the court’s history.

A student of history, he is an admirer of the longest-serving chief justice in American history, John Marshall, who avoided issuing rulings that would provoke direct confrontations with President Thomas Jefferson — a model he will now have to decide whether to emulate.

He will preside over a court with members who appear to be growing more restless. Throughout the summer, in appearances at judicial conferences and book talks, the justices aired disagreements over how the court was handling the president’s many requests, including how much the court should explain itself to the public and lower-court judges.

Tensions among the justices have also spilled out in their emergency rulings, in which the court’s liberals have sometimes included sharp words as their colleagues have cleared the way for the president’s agenda.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in particular has pointedly criticized her conservative colleagues, characterizing one ruling in July as “not only truly unfortunate but also hubristic and senseless.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested in a separate dissent in July that the majority was giving special treatment to Mr. Trump, writing that the administration “has the Supreme Court on speed dial.”

Kannon Shanmugam, who regularly argues cases before the court, said the bench that Chief Justice Roberts joined in 2005 was made up of justices who appeared more interested in the court’s institutional reputation.

“I think the chief justice is very much in that vein, but he doesn’t have a lot of partners right now in that regard, said Mr. Shanmugam, who was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia. “The challenge the chief justice has going forward is in managing this somewhat more individualistic and somewhat more fractious group of colleagues.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/05/multimedia/05DC-SCOTUS-fclj/05DC-SCOTUS-fclj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:58:28.516172

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu and his government resigned today. Lecornu, who was appointed in September, named his new cabinet hours before their resignations. Lecornu pointed to political parties “who continue to posture as if they had a majority” in France’s hung National Assembly as the reason for his decision. France’s main opposition parties called on French President Emmanuel Macron to call new parliamentary elections or resign in the wake of Lecornu’s departure. Victor Goury-Laffont reports for POLITICO.

The populist party of the Czech Republic’s former Prime Minister, billionaire Andrej Babiš, on Saturday won parliamentary elections in the country, although it fell short of an overall majority. Babiš, who during the election campaign argued that the high consumer costs are linked to the Czech Republic spending too much to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, is expected to be invited to lead talks on forming a new coalition. Rob Cameron reports for BBC News; Lara Jakes reports for the New York Times.

Syria yesterday held its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad regime, with the vote count ongoing at the time of writing. Voting in three provinces dominated by Kurdish and Druze factions was postponed due to “security and logistical challenges,” the authorities said. Eyad Kourdi reports for CNN.

Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Saturday elected hardline conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. If confirmed in an Oct. 15 parliamentary vote, Takaichi will become the country’s first female prime minister. A protégé of the late former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has vowed to bring back his economic vision, known as “Abenomics.” Tim Kelly, John Geddie, and Satoshi Sugiyama report for Reuters; Shaimaa Khalil reports for BBC News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Jared Kushner are expected to participate in negotiations in Egypt today on ending the war in Gaza, according to a White House official. Delegations from Israel and Hamas will participate in indirect talks on the first phase of the deal, concerning hostage release and prisoner exchange mediated by Egypt and Qatar, the Egyptian foreign ministry said yesterday. Hamas on Friday expressed willingness to release the remaining hostages but did not comment on many other parts of the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan, such as disarmament. Ashley Ahn, Shawn McCreesh, and Aaron Boxerman report for the New York Times.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday said that the United States was aiming for a quick deal to return the hostages to Israel, noting that the next phase of negotiations dealing with disarmament and setting up a new government in Gaza would be tougher. Trump said yesterday that talks with Hamas were advancing rapidly. “I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said on social media. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters; Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

Israeli airstrikes killed at least 36 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, according to local health officials. 18 people died in sporadic incidents, while 18 others were killed in a strike on a house in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, medical staff said. The strikes occurred after Trump’s call on social media on Friday evening for Israel to stop bombing Gaza. Trump on Saturday said he appreciated that Israel had “temporarily stopped bombing.” Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Mahmoud Issa report for Reuters.

“I don’t know why you’re always so f***ing negative. This is a win. Take it,” Trump told Netanyahu on Friday evening following Hamas’ initial positive response to the ceasefire plan, a U.S. official told Axios. The source said that Netanyahu had told Trump there was nothing to celebrate and that Hamas’ position meant nothing. An Israeli official said that Netanyahu viewed Hamas’ response as a rejection of Trump’s plan. Trump told Axios on Saturday that Netanyahu’s “fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine.” Barak Ravid and Marc Caputo report.

Israel has deported a further 29 activists who were detained last week for taking part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, the Israeli foreign ministry said yesterday. Israel has deported 170 of the 450 detained activists so far. Alexander Cornwell reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russia yesterday killed at least five people and damaged energy infrastructure across Ukraine, officials said. Four of those killed were in the western Lviv region, bordering Poland. The combined assault, which involved dozens of missiles and over 500 drones, struck nine regions in Ukraine and cut electricity for tens of thousands of people. Siobhán O’Grady and Serhiy Morgunov report for the Washington Post; Andriy Perun and Dan Peleschuk report for Reuters.

There is evidence of a “high level of cooperation” between China and Russia “in conducting satellite reconnaissance” of Ukraine to identify strategic objects to target, a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said on Saturday. The official did not disclose what evidence supported this position. Ron Popeski reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda will not sign an economic framework agreement this week as scheduled under the U.S.-brokered June peace agreement, sources told Reuters on Friday. According to a Rwandan official, the text was finalized after a round of negotiations in Washington, D.C., but Kinshasa was unwilling to sign the deal. Daphne Psaledakis, Jessica Donati, and Sonia Rolley report.

The U.N. Human Rights Council will today consider an EU proposal to set up a U.N. investigation into abuses in Afghanistan by both the Taliban and foreign troops similar to existing investigations into crimes in Syria and Myanmar. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

The Somali government today said that all seven al-Shabab militants who on Saturday attacked a high-security prison in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu have been killed. Neither the government nor al-Shabab confirmed their respective numbers of casualties. Wedaeli Chibelushi and Mohamud Abdisamad report for BBC News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

OpenAI and chip-designer Advanced Micro Devices today announced a new multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on AI data centers that would run on AMD’s new MI450 chips. The OpenAI-AMD agreement is one the most direct challenges yet to Nvidia’s dominance in the chipmaking sector. Robbie Whelan and Berber Jin report for the Wall Street Journal.

A Kremlin-backed cryptocurrency operation appears to have circumvented U.S. sanctions, moving at least $6 billion since August when several of its entities were blacklisted, according to a Financial Times analysis. Anastasia Stognei, Oliver Hawkins, and Eade Hemingway report.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Trump is expected to reduce refugee admissions from 125,000 to 7,500 people per year, according to a presidential determination signed 30 September seen by the New York Times. The unannounced refugee program proposes to reserve a bulk of the limited slots for white Afrikaners from South Africa, according to sources. Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Hamed Aleaziz, and Miriam Jordan report

ICE agents arrested 37 people and separated U.S. children from their parents during an overnight raid on apartments in Chicago last week. The Homeland Security Department said the building was targeted because it was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members.” Tenants said it appeared that everyone in the building was detained by federal officers, including four children who are U.S. citizens. DHS said the children were taken because their parents were detained due to their lack of legal status. Rebekah Riess and Bill Kirkos report for CNN.

The Trump administration is offering $2,500 to minors who came to the United States alone to “voluntarily” return to their home countries under a programme rolled out on Friday without a press release. ICE confirmed to POLITICO that ICE and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugees and Resettlement are offering a “strictly voluntary” self-deportation service. Erica Bazail-Eimil reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN THE CARIBBEAN

Trump said yesterday that U.S. forces hit another vessel allegedly carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela on Saturday. It is currently unclear if Trump was in fact referencing a strike announced on Friday by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. “They’re not coming in by sea anymore, so now we’ll have to start looking about the land,” Trump continued in a speech delivered at Naval Station Norfolk. Reuters reports.

The U.S. military killed four people in a strike against a boat in international waters near Venezuela, Hegseth announced on Friday. Hegseth alleged that the men had been smuggling narcotics but did not offer any evidence. This was the first strike since the Trump administration told Congress that the United States is in an “armed conflict” with Latin American cartels. Hegseth said yesterday that he has every authorization needed for U.S. military strikes on vessels off the coast of Venezuela. “These are designated foreign terrorist organizations.” Charlie Savage reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

China is using a barter-like system to pay Iran for oil while bypassing U.S. sanctions, Western officials told the Wall Street Journal. In order to side-step the international banking system, Iranian oil is shipped to China and, in return, state-backed Chinese companies build infrastructure in Iran. Some officials said that up to $8.4 billion in oil payments flowed through the hidden funding conduit last year to finance the Chinese infrastructure projects. Lauren Norman and James T. Areddy report.

Advisers of Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir approached U.S. officials with an offer to build and run a port on the Arabian Sea, according to a plan seen by the Financial Times. The plan envisages U.S. investors developing the town of Pasni as a terminal to ship Pakistan’s critical minerals to the United States. A senior U.S. official said that Trump and his advisers had not discussed such a proposal. Alec Russell and Humza Jilani report.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) yesterday criticised ICE agents for using increasingly violent tactics in Chicago, such as deploying chemical agents near a public school. “They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Pritzker said. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades.” Pritzker suggested that the Trump administration was intentionally heightening tensions in Chicago in order to send “even more troops.” Sophia Tareen reports for AP News.

“This morning, the Trump administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Gov. JB Pritzker said on Saturday, adding that Trump plans to federalize 300 National Guard troops in Illinois despite his clear opposition. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth considered sending an elite U.S. Army strike force to Portland to quell the protests last weekend, according to messages shared with the Minnesota Star Tribune. The messages show high-level officials discussing the deployment of the Army’s 82nd Airborne, an infantry division deployed during both world wars and the Vietnam War. Anthony Salisbury, a deputy to White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, sent the texts over Signal while traveling in Minnesota, in clear view of others. Andy Mannix reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Trump administration is preparing a plan that would make it harder for older Americans to qualify for Social Security disability payments, sources tell the Washington Post. Under the plan, the Social Security Administration would either no longer consider age in assessing whether a person can adjust to other types of work, or the age threshold would be increased to 60 years, the sources said. Meryl Kornfield and Lisa Rein report.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge this weekend twice blocked the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops into Oregon. In her initial Saturday order, the judge ruled that Trump’s claims that Portland was experiencing daily unrest were “untethered to facts” and said that she expected a trial court to find that the move exceeded Trump’s constitutional authority and likely violated the Tenth Amendment. Late yesterday, the judge issued a follow-up order banning the Trump administration from sending any National Guard troops to Portland after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tried to send hundreds of members of Texas’ and California’s National Guard to Oregon. The judge said that Hegseth’s action appeared to be “in direct contravention” of her earlier decision. The Trump administration has appealed the Saturday order. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO; Anna Griffin reports for the New York Times; Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration can, for now, proceed with plans to remove the Biden-era extension of Temporary Protected Status for more than 300,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday. The case returned to the Supreme Court after the administration appealed a substantive lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to have broken the law by revoking the TPS for Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants. In a brief order, the majority of the court ruled that “although the posture of the case has changed [since May, when the Supreme Court stayed a preliminary injunction blocking Noem’s move], the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not.” Julianna Bragg reports for Axios; Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that there was a “realistic likelihood” that the indictment filed against Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia amounted to a vindictive prosecution by the Justice Department. The judge held that Abrego is entitled to discovery and requires an evidentiary hearing before the Court decides on his motion to dismiss his indictment. Alan Feuer reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION — LAWSUITS

A group of unions, higher education professionals, religious organizations, and others on Friday filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to charge a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, granted to skilled foreign workers. The lawsuit argues that Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally alter the visa program and that the administration did not go through the required regulatory process to institute the fee. Madeleine Ngo and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times.

A federal workers union on Friday filed a complaint suing the Trump administration over its insertion of blaming Democrats for the government shutdown into Education Department employees’ out-of-office email messages. The lawsuit argues that “Forcing civil servants to speak on behalf of the political leadership’s partisan agenda is a blatant violation of federal employees’ First Amendment rights.” Shannon Bond reports for NPR.

Over 200 international students whose visas were withheld by the Trump administration are suing the State Department to get their visas reinstated, according to court documents reviewed by the Hill. Surina Benkat reports.

The justices have so far granted a small list of petitions with employment and labor law implications, but are set to hear at least one dispute by November concerning the legal and constitutional protections that apply to prisoners or detainees who perform work.

The FTC case and equal protection challenges to states banning transgender girls and women from competing on female athletic teams are likely to have significant ripple effects in the labor and anti-bias legal arenas.

More cases are likely to come this term.

The high court is expected to ultimately review the merits of ongoing disputes over President Donald Trump’s unprecedented terminations of Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, as well as mass firings of federal workers after the majority used its controversial “shadow docket” to greenlight those actions as litigation plays out.

Here’s how the upcoming Supreme Court term is kicking off for employment law:

Separation-of-Powers

The Trump administration’s push to topple a 90-year-old precedent and expand the White House’s power over federal agencies that previously operated outside of its direct control, including those regulating labor and employment, will take center stage in Trump v. Slaughter.

That case concerns a FTC Democratic member’s challenge to his termination. But it goes to the heart of the Supreme Court’s Humphrey’s Executor v. US decision, which upheld the constitutionality of job shields for FTC members by allowing only dismissals for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” and opened the door for similar safeguards for other independent agencies.

The administration hasn’t argued that Humphrey’s Executor must be overturned to justify Trump’s dismissal of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox and MSPB member Cathy Harris, who have tenure protections similar to those of FTC members. The US Justice Department claimed the justices’ 2020 Seila Law v. CFPB ruling suggests they’re not insulated by Humphrey’s Executor due to the executive authority they exercise.

Cases arising from the president’s recent firings raise novel legal questions. The high court’s final decision in Slaughter could offer precise guidance to lower courts on the scope of presidential removal power.

The case will be argued during the court’s December argument session, which begins Dec. 1 and ends Dec. 10.

Detainee Wage Case

Attorneys for Geo Group Inc. and a class of civil immigrant detainees will face off at oral arguments on Nov. 10 over whether the high court should allow the private prison operator to seek immediate appellate review of its derivative sovereign immunity defense.

GEO, which has a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract to run detention facilities, is accused of forcing detainees in Colorado to perform various jobs—including preparing food, operating the library, and doing laundry—or risk solitary confinement under a voluntary work program. They were paid just $1 per day, the suit said.

The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit last year upheld a district judge’s summary judgment ruling on GEO’s immunity defense, saying immediate review is unwarranted before the detainees’ underlying claims are addressed.

The justices now have an opportunity to resolve a split among eight federal circuit courts, five of which the private prison operator said foreclosed immediate review of district court orders blocking government contractors from raising a derivative sovereign immunity defense in litigation regarding their contracts.

A Supreme Court order mandating immediate circuit review of the legal defense, which allows government contractors to claim immunity that the US would have had if sued for the same actions, would benefit cases beyond the labor law context. But for detained immigrant workers, an additional procedural step in the litigation process would further extend the timeline for arguing the merits of their allegations in court, attorneys and prison labor scholars said.

GEO’s high court petition maintained that the justices need to clear up the circuit divide, as the legal path for litigants is currently unclear.

The underlying lawsuit is just one of several currently being litigated across the US for similar programs, and the question of whether state labor law applies to federal immigration detainees has been a novel issue.

Transgender Rights

High court cases Little v. Hecox and West Virginia Board of Education v. B.P.J. center on whether state laws banning transgender athletes from participating on female sports teams violate the US Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

A ruling in both disputes could significantly affect transgender rights in sports, but also potentially clarify the scope of anti-discrimination protections for gender identity in broader contexts like employment and education, court watchers said.

Transgender workers have invoked the Equal Protection Clause in discrimination cases, including a recent challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s retreat from transgender discrimination enforcement.

Last term, the Supreme Court declined to clarify the level of review for Equal Protection claims in transgender bias cases, but three conservative justices expressed that the more lenient rational basis applies, rather than “intermediate” scrutiny.

Asked on Sunday night when federal workers would be fired as he has threatened to do, Trump told reporters: ""It's taking place right now and it's all because of the Democrats.""

""The Democrats are causing the loss of a lot of jobs,"" Trump added, declining to answer a question about which agencies are subject to the cuts.

The possibility of layoffs would escalate an already tense situation in which Washington lawmakers have struggled to find common ground and build mutual trust. Leaders in both parties are betting that public sentiment has swung their way, putting pressure on the other side to cave.

Democrats are insisting on renewing subsidies to cover health insurance costs for millions of households, while Trump wants to preserve existing spending levels as he believes that Democrats will have to cave because of the jobs and federal projects being put at risk.

The squabble comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as Trump's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting last Monday.

""And, unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,"" Jeffries said. ""And what we've seen is negotiation through deepfake videos, the House canceling votes, and of course President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That's not responsible behavior.""

The Trump administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.

Even though it would be Trump's choice to cut jobs, he believes he can put the blame on the Democrats because of the shutdown.

""It's up to them,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday morning before boarding the presidential helicopter to celebrate the Navy's 250th anniversary in Norfolk, Virginia.

While Trump rose to fame on the TV show ""The Apprentice"" with its catchphrase of ""You're fired,"" Republicans on Sunday claimed that the administration would take no pleasure in letting go of federal workers, even though the administration had also put funding on hold for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic areas without clear signs of remorse.

""We haven't seen the details yet about what's happening"" with layoffs, House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday morning on NBC. ""But it is a regrettable situation that the president does not want.""

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, also said the administration would prefer to avoid the layoffs.

""We want the Democrats to come forward and to make a deal that's a clean, continuing resolution that gives us seven more weeks to talk about these things,"" Hassett said on CNN. ""But the bottom line is that with Republicans in control, the Republicans have a lot more power over the outcome than the Democrats.""

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying on NBC that the possible increase in health care costs for ""millions of Americans"" would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a ""crisis.""

But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has stopped congressionally approved spending from being used. That essentially undermines the value of Democrats trying to seek compromises on the budget since the administration could block the spending of money from any deal. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in "" pocket rescissions "" on foreign aid, a process that meant the spending was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.

""We need both to address the health care crisis and we need some written assurance in the law - I won't take a promise - that they're not going to renege on any deal we make,"" Schiff said.

The television appearances indicated that Democrats and Republicans are busy talking, deploying internet memes against each other that have raised concerns about whether it's possible to negotiate in good faith.

Vice President JD Vance said a video putting Jeffries in a sombrero and thick mustache was simply a joke, even though it came across as mocking people of Mexican descent as Republicans insist that the Democratic demands would lead to health care spending on immigrants in the country illegally, a claim that Democrats dispute.

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for any federal health care programs, including insurance provided through the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. Still, hospitals do receive Medicaid reimbursements for emergency care that they are obligated to provide to people who meet other Medicaid eligibility requirements but do not have an eligible immigration status.

The challenge, however, is that the two parties do not appear to be having productive conversations with each other in private, even as Republicans insist they are in conversation with their Democratic colleagues.

On Friday, a Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed to notch the necessary 60 votes to end a filibuster. Johnson said the House would close for legislative business next week, a strategy that could obligate the Senate to work with the government funding bill that was passed by House Republicans.

""Johnson's not serious about this,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on CBS. ""He sent all his congressmen home last week and home this week. How are you going to negotiate?""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Sunday that the shutdown on discretionary spending, the furloughing of federal workers and requirements that other federal employees work without pay will go on so long as Democrats vote no.

""They'll get another chance on Monday to vote again,"" Thune said on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

""And I'm hoping that some of them have a change of heart,"" he said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17949186_100625-cc-ap-capitol-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-06 10:56:52.217128

“Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,” Vice President JD Vance said Sept. 28 on “Fox News Sunday.”

President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and Republican members of Congress have repeated this line.

It’s wrong.

Democrats have refused to vote for Republicans’ resolution to extend the federal spending deadline, and their position does, in part, hinge on health care spending. Democrats want to extend covid pandemic-era Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back Medicaid cuts in the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law this summer.

The Democrats’ proposal wouldn’t give health care to immigrants who lack legal status; that population is already largely ineligible for federally funded health care. Instead, the proposal would restore access to certain health care programs for legally present immigrants who will lose access under the Republican law.

The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment for this fact check. Vance addressed criticism of his talking point in another interview by saying it was included in the Democrats’ spending proposal. It’s not.

A White House X account followed up with screenshots of the Democratic proposal repealing a section of the Republican law labeled “alien Medicaid eligibility.” It’s important to know that these changes would not give Medicaid access to immigrants who lack lawful status.

Vance defended his statement again in an Oct. 1 White House press conference, saying former President Joe Biden “waived away illegal immigration status” that helped migrants access federal assistance. It’s important to note that many people granted lawful status through humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status programs don’t automatically qualify for Medicaid; TPS recipients aren’t eligible, and many people who entered the U.S. on humanitarian parole are required to wait five years before accessing it.

The Trump administration has ended humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status for many people, rendering them ineligible for Medicaid and health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

We did not find evidence that Democrats want to spend “hundreds of billions” in costs for insuring migrants with unlawful presence.

Immigrants Lacking Legal Status Are Already Ineligible

Most federal health care dollars cannot be spent on health care for people in the U.S. who lack legal status. They cannot enroll in Medicaid or Medicare, and they are ineligible to purchase health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. A small Medicaid program reimburses hospitals for uninsured emergency care, which can include immigrants in the country without authorization but is not exclusive to them.

States such as California and Illinois expanded Medicaid coverage for people regardless of their immigration status, and the states pay for that. Federal law already banned states from using federal money for these programs. An earlier version of the Republican spending law would have penalized such states by withholding funding, but that provision didn’t last.

People in the country without permission might receive some federally funded health care in emergency cases; in those situations, hospitals must provide care even if a person is uninsured or in the country illegally. Emergency Medicaid covers hospital care for immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. The Republican tax and spending law reduced the amount hospitals can receive for emergency immigrant care.

Most Emergency Medicaid spending is used on childbirth. In all, it represented less than 1% of total Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2023, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

GOP Law Limited Care Access for Immigrants With Legal Status

The Republican tax and spending law made several changes to health care eligibility for immigrants living in the country with permission. An estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants are expected to lose their health insurance, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office projections.

Starting October 2026, the law will restrict eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to lawfully permanent residents, people from the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, or Palau who lawfully reside in the U.S. under an international agreement, and certain Cubans and Haitians.

Previously, a broad group, described as “qualified noncitizens,” was eligible for Medicaid and its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, including refugees and people granted asylum.

Some immigrants eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, such as lawful permanent residents, are required to wait five years before accessing the benefits.

The law also limited Affordable Care Act marketplace eligibility to the same group eligible for Medicaid and CHIP beginning Jan. 1, 2027. Previously, people who were described as “lawfully present” were eligible. That group included the “qualified noncitizens” eligible for Medicaid and people with short-term statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status or international students.

Beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, for immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization as children were previously eligible for Affordable Care Act coverage and its subsidies. They are ineligible since a Trump administration rule took effect in August.

Democrats’ Proposal Would Restore Legal Immigrants’ Access

The Democrats’ Sept. 17 budget proposal would, in part, permanently extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back billions in Republican cuts to Medicaid and other health programs.

The change would make Medicaid, CHIP, and Affordable Care Act coverage available to all legal immigrants who were previously eligible for it, such as refugees and people granted asylum.

The Democratic proposal would not broaden eligibility to federally funded health care programs to immigrants lacking legal status.

Vance said the Democratic policies would “give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,” and the White House did not offer its source for that figure. When Johnson was pressed to support a similar talking point, he referenced the Congressional Budget Office. The KFF analysis of CBO estimates found that the Republican law’s provisions related to legal immigrants would reduce federal spending by $131 billion; this projection did not include an estimate for people without legal status.

Vance said, “Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens.”

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are largely ineligible for the federally funded health care programs Medicare and Medicaid, and they cannot seek coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace or apply for subsidies.

The Democrats’ budget proposal would not change that.

The Democrats want to restore access to certain health care programs to legal immigrants who will lose access under the Republican tax and spending law — among other measures aimed at making Medicaid and Affordable Care Act insurance plans easier to keep.

Their proposal would not grant federally supported health care benefits to people in the U.S. illegally, because they did not have access to them in the first place. The small amount of funding designated for Emergency Medicaid reimburses hospitals that provide emergency care to immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. Finally, we did not find evidence for Vance’s assertion that Democrats want “hundreds of billions” in health benefits for migrants in the country illegally.

Leaders in both parties are betting that public sentiment has swung their way, putting pressure on the other side to cave. Democrats are insisting on renewing subsidies to cover health insurance costs for millions of households, while President Donald Trump wants to preserve existing spending levels and threatening to permanently fire federal workers if the government remains closed.

The squabble comes at a moment of troubling economic uncertainty. While the U.S. economy has continued to grow this year, hiring has slowed and inflation remains elevated as Trump's import taxes have created a series of disruptions for businesses and employers have hurt confidence in his leadership. At the same time, there is a recognition that the nearly $2 trillion annual budget deficit is financially unsustainable yet there has to be a coalition around the potential tax increases and spending cuts to reduce borrowing levels.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, among those appearing on the Sunday news shows, said there have been no talks with Republican leaders since their White House meeting Monday.

“And unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,” Jeffries said. “And what we’ve seen is negotiation through deep fake videos, the House canceling votes, and of course President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That’s not responsible behavior.”

Trump was asked via text message by CNN's Jake Tapper about shutdown talks. The Republican president responded with confidence but no details.

“We are winning and cutting costs big time,” Trump said in a text message, according to CNN.

His administration sees the shutdown as an opening to wield greater power over the budget, with multiple officials saying they will save money as workers are furloughed by imposing permanent job cuts on thousands of government workers, a tactic that has never been used before.

While Trump rose to fame on the TV show “The Apprentice” with is catchphrase of “You're fired,” Republicans on Sunday claimed that the administration would take no pleasure in letting go of federal workers, even though they have put funding on hold for infrastructure and energy projects in Democratic areas.

“We haven’t seen the details yet about what’s happening” with layoffs, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on NBC. “But it is a regrettable situation that the president does not want.”

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said that the administration wants to avoid the layoffs it had indicated could start on Friday, a deadline that came and went without any decisions being announced.

“We want the Democrats to come forward and to make a deal that’s a clean, continuing resolution that gives us seven more weeks to talk about these things,” Hassett said on CNN. “But the bottom line is that with Republicans in control, the Republicans have a lot more power over the outcome than the Democrats.”

Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California defended his party's stance on the shutdown, saying on NBC that the possible increase in health care costs for “millions of Americans” would make insurance unaffordable in what he called a “crisis.”

But Schiff also noted that the Trump administration has withheld congressionally approved spending from being used, essentially undermining the value of Democrats' seeking compromises on the budgets as the White House could decline to not honor Congress' wishes. The Trump administration sent Congress roughly $4.9 billion in pocket rescissions” on foreign aid, a process that meant the spending was withheld without time for Congress to weigh in before the previous fiscal year ended last month.

“We need both to address the health care crisis and we need some written assurance in the law, I won’t take a promise, that they’re not going to renege on any deal we make,” Schiff said.

The television appearances indicated that Democrats and Republicans are busy talking, deploying internet memes against each other that have raised concerns about whether it's possible to negotiate in good faith.

Vice President JD Vance said that a video putting Jeffries in a sombrero and thick mustache was simply a joke, even though it came across as mocking people of Mexican descent as Republicans insist that the Democratic demands would lead to health care spending on immigrants in the country illegally, a claim that Democrats dispute.

Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for any federal health care programs, including insurance provided through the Affordable Care Act.

The challenge, however, is that the two parties do not appear to be having productive conversations with each other in private.

On Friday, a Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would reopen the government failed to notch the necessary 60 votes to end a filibuster. Johnson said the House would close for legislative business next week, a strategy that could obligate the Senate to work with the government funding bill that was passed by House Republicans.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Sunday that the shutdown on discretionary spending, the furloughing of federal workers and requirements that other federal employees work without pay will go on so long as Democrats vote no.

“They’ll get another chance on Monday to vote again,” said Thune on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

NICK EICHER, HOST: It’s Monday the 6th of October.

Glad to have you along for today’s edition of The World and Everything in It. Good morning, I’m Nick Eicher.

MARY REICHARD, HOST: And I’m Mary Reichard.

This is not just any old Monday. This is the first Monday in October, when the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court return to the bench for a new term.

EICHER: Here on Legal Docket, that’s a little like opening day in baseball, except it’s the playoffs, so it’s more like the opening faceoff for a new hockey season, but I digress.

What the First Monday brings is a fresh slate of cases and controversies, many that will bring rulings that will affect our daily lives.

REICHARD: Starting next week, we’ll have coverage of oral arguments so you can hear directly from the lawyers and justices. But today we’re looking ahead at some of the bigger disputes already on the docket.

EICHER: And for that, we’ve brought in all the senior partners in the firm Reichard, Rough, and West—WORLD’s legal reporters Jenny Rough and Steve West join us. Good morning to you both.

All three of the lawyers have prepared three cases each, matters they’ll be following closely this term.

REICHARD: So let’s get started. Jenny has the first case for us.

EICHER: She does. First up, Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections. This one involves the dreadlocks an inmate wears, or rather the dreadlocks he used to wear. Dreadlocks that were cut off against his will. The question is whether he can sue prison officials for damages under federal religious-liberty law. Jenny, what happened here, and why is this before the U.S. Supreme Court?

JENNY ROUGH: Damon Landor is a practicing Rastafari, so he took the Nazirite vow to not cut his hair. But as you mentioned, the prison officials cut it anyway. And the statute at play is known as RLUIPA, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act.

Now there’s no circuit split in this case. Circuit courts have consistently said an inmate cannot sue individual prison officials for money damages under the federal law. But there is a Supreme Court case about a sister statute that has identical wording in its relief provision that says such lawsuits are allowed. So the court is going to have to thread that needle.

EICHER: If the Court were to side with Landor here, Jenny—if it opens the door to damages—how big could that be for other inmates?

ROUGH: Well, it could expand an inmate’s ability to sue under this federal law, but the law does fall within a certain context. But it would certainly be a strong deterrent to prison officials.

EICHER: Alright, number two Trump v. Slaughter. President Trump fired the head of the Federal Trade Commission, the commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, and he fired her without giving a reason. Federal law says commissioners can only be removed for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance. So could you lay the facts out in this one..

ROUGH: Well, the president, as the head of the executive branch, has very broad powers to remove members of the executive branch. But as you mentioned, there’s a federal law, the Federal Trade Commission Act, that says a commissioner can only be removed for specific reasons. And Slaughter argues her removal was unlawful because none of those reasons existed.

EICHER: So I understand a lot of the case law here goes way back to the 1930s when the size of government really exploded.

ROUGH: Yeah, ninety years ago, the Supreme Court decided Humphrey’s Executor versus the United States. In a very similar set of facts, President Franklin D. Roosevelt fired Federal Trade Commissioner William Humphrey because Humphrey didn’t agree with the president’s policies. But the Court held that the president couldn’t do that because of the statute.

And the rationale at the time was that the commission’s job wasn’t purely executive. It included quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial tasks.

So jumping forward to the current case, the court wants answers to two questions: Does the federal statute’s removal protections violate the separation of powers? And if so, does Humphrey’s Executor need to be overturned?

But either way, it seems like the court will look at the role of the FTC and how it has changed over the years.

EICHER: Alright, Jenny, well the third one is Case v. Montana. In this one, police entered a man’s home without a warrant after a welfare call. So it’s a little bit different. He says that violated his Fourth Amendment rights. So could you walk us through how this case unfolded.

ROUGH: Yeah, and just a real quick reminder, the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. And it says search warrants must be based on probable cause. But there are exceptions.

So, it was actually William Cases’ ex-girlfriend called the police. She was on the phone with Case when she heard a pop and then silence, and he had been threatening suicide. So the police went to his house. Nobody answered. They entered. Case stepped out of a closet holding a dark object in his outstretched arm. And an officer shot him in the abdomen. And the dark object was a gun. So Case was arrested for assaulting a peace officer, but he now wants the gun and other evidence suppressed, saying police violated his Fourth Amendment rights by entering his house without a warrant.

So the question here is what standard applies for this emergency aid exception to getting a warrant. The traditional standard is probable cause that an emergency was unfolding, or is it a lesser standard like reasonable suspicion?

EICHER: So I guess, too, whether it makes a difference that this wasn’t a criminal investigation, but rather just a welfare check? That’s pretty key I would imagine.

ROUGH: That is such an interesting question, and it flags a tension that makes this case so hard. If police had been investigating Case for a crime, they would have needed probable cause. But because they were supposedly helping, they’re arguing the standard is lower. The Court has long said the home is entitled to the highest level of protection. So it kind of begs the question: Why would a criminal be entitled to greater protection than a person who needs help?

So the justices are going to have to wrestle with protecting the sanctity of the home, but at the same time, wanting police to be able to enter a house when a life is in danger.

EICHER: All right, Jenny, thanks so much time now to turn to Steve West. He's been watching several cases with First Amendment and executive power themes. Steve first up for you, Chiles v. Salazar. Colorado bars licensed counselors from engaging minors in what the state calls “conversion therapy.”

Colorado bars licensed counselors from engaging minors in what the state calls conversion therapy. So in this one, we see a Christian counselor saying that the state ban violates her free-speech rights because it allows therapists to affirm same-sex attraction or affirm a gender transition, but not to question any of those things. So talk a bit about that for us, Steve.

STEVE WEST: Well, Nick, the law actually says that it prohibits mental-health professionals from engaging in any practice or treatment, and that includes simply talking to a person that attempts or purports to change their minds about their sexual orientation or gender identity. So it’s like a lot of other laws that have proliferated around the country, whether they’re passed by states or local municipalities or counties.

It’s a speech ban. You can help an individual explore and even affirm their same-sex attraction or a gender not matching their sex, but you can’t help them become comfortable in their own sex or cope with their same-sex attraction.

So Kaleigh Chiles—she’s the counselor here—says this is a free-speech issue, that this is a ban of certain speech not approved by the state, whereas other speech is approved by the state. So it’s focused on the content of speech and therefore violates her free-speech rights.

EICHER: Well, there’s a pretty direct tie from this one to the next case, Steve—going from free speech and counseling to free speech and association in a different context, pro-life ministry.

This one is First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin. New Jersey’s attorney general had subpoenaed a pro-life pregnancy center, demanding donor lists and demanding internal records. The center says this is a clear violation of its First Amendment rights. So what is the state after here?

WEST: Yeah, first of all, just to clarify, the subpoena issued by the attorney general is an investigatory subpoena. It’s not a court subpoena. So it doesn’t have any power, in and of itself, to force the pro-life ministry here to disclose the identities of its donors or their other information—their names and addresses and that kind of thing.

So he has to go to court—state court—in order to get an order enforcing it, which is what the attorney general has done. And also, the pro-life ministry here has gone to federal court at the same time and asked for an order barring the state from getting this information.

And the federal court has deferred to the state and said the issue is not yet ripe for consideration, that you can certainly litigate your claims in state court. So what the case is about is which court can we be in, rather than the constitutional issue at this point at least.

EICHER: Well, Steve, Jenny had a case on presidential power, and you do too. This last one for you is Learning Resources v. Trump.

Two family-owned toy companies in this one are challenging tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They argue that Congress gave too much trade authority over to the President. So, Steve, go through the facts here for us

WEST: Yeah, these are two companies that import educational toys that are made in China and a few other countries that are affected by tariffs. The Constitution says Congress can assess tariffs, but Congress has also delegated some of that authority to the executive branch through this International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

And so it authorizes the President to take action to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States if he declares a national emergency—which is what President Trump has done in this case.

EICHER: And so on top of everything, it’s on an expedited schedule.

WEST: It is. It'll be heard In November—pretty quickly.

EICHER: Yeah, all right. Well, questions of free speech, donor privacy, and executive power. Steve, thank you very much.

WEST: You’re welcome.

EICHER:Well, Mary, you’ve been looking at three more cases, starting with a pair of them on women’s sports.

First up, West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Little v. Hecox.

So what are these about? I thought we’d settled these women’s-sports questions.

These two could answer some of the questions left open by the recent Skrmetti decision, right? (And while you’re at it, remind us what Skrmetti was about.)

REICHARD: Well, we haven’t. These two cases come out of West Virginia—obviously for one of them—the other one comes out of Idaho, which was the first state to pass laws protecting women’s sports and reserving female sports for females. There is a court split about whether those laws are constitutional. But this really is a big deal because twenty-seven states have something similar to the laws in these two states also protecting women’s sports.

EICHER: All right, so these two could answer some of the questions, I guess, left open by the recent Skrmetti decision. And maybe while you’re at it, tell us what Skrmetti was all about.

REICHARD: Yeah, be glad to. That was a six-to-three ruling that upheld Tennessee’s law banning medical intervention on minors suffering from gender dysphoria. So this is a really big deal affecting all those other states, and there is a court split whether these laws protecting women’s sports are constitutional, which is one reason SCOTUS took the case in the first place. And then one issue that remains is whether the “T” in the LGBT is a protected class, and that is hugely important.

EICHER: All right, so the justices here are going to have to decide what standard applies—what legal standard—whether it’s strict scrutiny or something else.

REICHARD: Yeah, bingo. You can recall we have three levels of scrutiny. We have rational-basis, which is really easy to meet; intermediate, a little bit harder; and then, as you say, strict scrutiny, which is the most difficult to overcome. And what classification we’re talking about determines which level of scrutiny we use. So here the justices will have to decide which level applies.

EICHER: Okay, so we have sports, we have equal protection, we’ve got money in elections—another perennial topic for the Court.

This one is National Republican Senatorial Committee v. FEC, the Federal Election Commission. It’s a campaign-finance case about how much coordination is permitted between political parties and their candidates.

So how are the Republicans framing up the argument here?

REICHARD: Well, like a lot of cases, it’s money, money, money. That’s what this is about. And the Republicans are arguing that this is a First Amendment-violation case. They say, “Hey, why limit parties like that when we have super PACs without any spending limits at all?” Political parties and candidates can coordinate their spending. There are limits in the law about how much you can donate to a campaign individually. So that’s what the Republicans say—that makes no sense at all.

EICHER:All right, your final case, Mary. It has to do with immigration and asylum.

This one is Urias-Orellana v. Bondi. That’s Pam Bondi, the attorney general. A man from El Salvador here fled after gang violence killed two of his brothers and threatened the rest of his family. He entered the U.S. He asked for asylum.

So walk us through this case. What is the Court being asked to decide

REICHARD: Yeah, it’s a technical legal question, and that is whether appellate judges have to defer to immigration courts on what persecution means under the law, or can appellate judges decide for themselves if the facts are indeed persecution. So it has a very particular meaning. We just don’t know what it is yet.

EICHER: So ultimately this dispute is over who makes the final call here, whether it’s an immigration judge or an appellate court.

REICHARD: That’s right, and we get a lot of cases like that. The facts are pretty dazzling, but the technical legal question—not so much. And this is one of them.

EICHER: All right, and that is this week’s Legal Docket. Jenny Rough, thank you.

ROUGH: Thank you. That was fun.

EICHER: And Steve West, thank you too.

WEST: Thanks Nick.

World citizenship, as the highest level of allegiance, empowers us to focus on equity, justice, sustainability, unity, and harmony with each other and the Earth.","More than 120 million people have been displaced from their homes due to war, climate change, political instability, and oppression in the past few years, a figure that has doubled in the last decade. Millions more are living in vulnerable situations as stateless individuals, frequently unable to exercise even their most basic rights.

The population of displaced persons is larger than that of more than 220 countries and dependent territories. In other words, only 12 countries in the world have a population larger than 120 million people. As the UN High Commissioner for Refugees explains, “one out of every 67 people on the Earth” is displaced from their homes. More than “20 people are forced to flee every minute of every day” according to the International Rescue Committee. These figures do not even account for the day-to-day oppression that millions, if not billions, face but who are unable or reluctant to leave to seek a safe haven.

Most refugees in the world are either internally displaced in or are fleeing from the following countries: Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Yemen.

As violence, war, and climate destruction affect more countries and regions of the world, the growing numbers of refugees and migrants could put a strain on social systems. National governments have responded to immigration flows in different ways, some limiting immigrants from entering their claimed territories and others welcoming newcomers. Just five countries — Iran, Turkey, Colombia, Germany, and Uganda — have welcomed almost 40% of the world’s refugees and others fleeing persecution and war.

The nation-state system has created the “refugee” and “stateless person,” as well as the severe problems associated with being considered outside the law or without “legal” status. All human beings are legal and have rights that should be respected wherever they live. Yet, due to violations of their human rights frequently perpetuated by or ignored by national governments, thousands of people flee their homes and countries every day trying to find safety, stability, and asylum.

By dividing up the world into 200 or so different countries, we have created “in” and “out” groups, with some achieving dignity, acceptance, inclusion, and rights fulfillment, and others being treated as less than human, unable to meet their basic daily needs. This disparity of treatment destabilizes society.

Why should our fellow humans have to flee to have their rights and basic needs upheld? Why are millions stuck in refugee camps with inadequate food, housing, healthcare, education, and opportunity?

To have the kind of world in which the rights reaffirmed in various declarations and treaties such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights are fully met, we should all be able to claim, and then exercise, our rights no matter where we happen to live on the planet. Human rights and duties are not bound by territory; they are not dependent upon the nation-state in which one happens to be born or where one happens to live.

Human rights are innate and unalienable; we are born with them, and we cannot give them up. We have them simply by being human.

What if we were to claim a citizenship that inherently affirms our rights wherever we find ourselves on planet Earth?

If everyone had citizenship everywhere, statelessness would no longer exist, and only natural disasters would forcibly displace people. With world citizenship, if we do not like where we live, if we do not like the politics or the rulers, then we could choose to live somewhere else, rather than being forced to flee for our safety and livelihood.

World citizenship, as a valid and legal citizenship beyond any other status that someone may carry, would ensure that everyone has at least one citizenship which, in its inclusiveness, upholds our concomitant rights and duties.

Requiring all governments to respect world citizenship status legally is the next step – a step that will support millions of displaced persons, by ensuring that governments will begin to fulfill their obligations to respect refugees, stateless and displaced persons’ innate and unalienable rights. To promote respect for this highest citizenship status, global institutions of law, such as a World Court of Human Rights and a World Parliament of the people, must be established.

World citizenship, as the highest level of allegiance, empowers us to focus on equity, justice, sustainability, unity, and harmony with each other and the Earth.

As long as we, the people of the world, allow the nation-state system to maintain the arbitrary and exclusive borders that divide humans from one another, immigration will continue to be viewed as a problem rather than as an educational, economic, political, and social opportunity. When we respect each other, our rights and duties, as world citizens, the entire earth will be a sanctuary of peace and safety for all.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/salah-darwish-hgS8njCYwP8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 02:56:25.836199

You can read the first here and the second here.

Why are the ECHR and Human Rights Act relevant to immigration? I thought they were just supposed to protect citizens, not foreigners with no right to be here.

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act apply to everyone, even asylum-seekers. However, they are not the first thing to which people turn to know where they stand. Just as fair trial rights existed for us in our common law before appearing in the Human Rights Act, so asylum policy is set by the UK government, with the Human Rights Act acting as a backstop check to make sure we have got it right.

The UK, as a liberal democratic state with the rule of law, does not tolerate torture or inhuman treatment. Our criminal law protects us from such things and we can bring civil claims against anyone who harms us like that. We don’t deport people to places where they will be tortured either. It’s part of our values. The Human Rights Act reinforces those values but does not create them.

READ MORE: What has the European Convention on Human Rights ever done for us?

The same goes for British citizens wanting to be joined by their foreign national family members such as a spouse or children. It’s our Home Office that sets immigration policy and can reject applications using the strong, muscular, definition of the public interest that Parliament provides. The ECHR and the Human Rights Act make little difference and the numbers relying on them are small. The rare cases that succeed usually involve British family members that need care or looking after. Even then, a foreign national with a criminal record may be refused in the public interest.

Doesn’t the ECHR/HRA mean that people wanting to come to the UK, or who have landed on small boats with dodgy asylum claims, or who are here illegally, can get round the immigration rules?

No. There are tough rules in place that ensure that people who cross the Channel may be sent back to France to have their asylum claims determined there. The new UK-France Treaty on preventing dangerous journeys means that France has to take them back when the UK asks. Those asylum-seekers that remain here get their claims processed here because like all democratic states in Europe, we abide by the Refugee Convention. We don’t send people back to counties where they face persecution or torture. Like all European democracies we are signed up not only to the ECHR but to the big UN global treaties on this as well.

Doesn’t the ECHR/HRA stop us deporting foreigners who have committed serious crimes because their child would miss chicken nuggets or because life is a bit tough back home?

No. The public interest dominates consideration of these issues by the Home Office and immigration judges. Where a UK-resident British citizen has a foreign national spouse or child and aspires to live with them in the UK there are demanding conditions, including a high-income threshold to be satisfied. Presently, an income of £29,000 is required to apply to bring in a spouse. Family life human rights provide a backstop for the small, residual number of hard cases or unusual cases for which the rules – being general in nature – make no provision.

There are also some cases concerning foreign nationals convicted of criminal offences who stand to be deported from the UK. Some of them seek to resist deportation as they have UK-resident family members, again typically, a British citizen spouse or child. It is these cases that tend to get media attention. In fact, Home Office policy and appeals law define the public interest at such a high level that almost all foreign national criminal claims fail.

Parliament has said in law that the deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest. It also states that the more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater the public interest in the deportation of that person. Foreign nationals given prison sentences on conviction face very high hurdles. Without a British citizen family member with care needs or who needs looking after, for whom it would be unjustifiably harsh or who has very compelling circumstances, foreign national criminals have very little chance of success. A case that might succeed is where a sick British citizen child needs her foreign national parent to look after her.

The numbers who succeed in an immigration appeal are tiny. A 2025 Bonavero Institute report estimates that the number of deportation appeals won on family life human rights grounds is about 2.5% of those deported. In the 15 months to June 2021 only 45 deportation appeals were allowed by an immigration tribunal on human rights grounds. That is not very many.

Great caution should be taken when reading media reports of a dislike of foreign chicken nuggets or an affection for a pet being the central issue in any cases. If such matters sound like a fantastical basis for deciding an immigration appeal, that is because in reality immigration appeals are not won on such grounds.

Didn’t the ECHR/HRA stop the Tories’ Rwanda plans? Could it stop Labour’s returns deal with France?

No. France is not Rwanda. Human Rights law stopped removal to Rwanda as there was a risk of the asylum seekers sent there being sent on to their home country where was a risk of ill-treatment or torture. The Labour government’s scheme to transfer asylum-seekers to France under the 2025 UK-France Agreement does not face the same hurdles. Like the UK, France applies ECHR human rights. It is also bound by EU asylum laws. Asylum-seekers in France can seek protection from French courts.

Aren’t appeals to the Strasbourg Court a way in which lawyers representing clients with dodgy cases can frustrate and spin out the process?

No. UK immigration cases barely feature there. UK domestic tribunals are where immigration cases end in all but a literal handful of cases. There is a right of petition to Strasbourg once domestic remedies have been exhausted. However, the chances of a successful outcome are miniscule. Only a small number of applications are made. Of those, the vast majority are filtered out at the admission stage, for example as being manifestly ill-founded.

In the tiny number of cases that progress to a full hearing, the UK government mostly wins. Since 1980 there have been only 29 UK deportation cases decided by the Strasbourg Court, of which the UK won 16. The reality is that the Strasbourg Court’s judgments make little difference.

If we left the ECHR and scrapped the HRA wouldn’t we be able to deport anyone we decided shouldn’t be here without pesky courts getting in the way?

No, it’s not that easy. There are other impediments such as the high cost of immigration detention and removal, the problems of documenting and securing the identity and nationality of persons, the role of our common law in fundamental rights protection, and the lack of effective re-admission co-operation by home states.

In any event, as already mentioned, the UK is a liberal democratic state with the rule of law. We do not tolerate torture or inhuman treatment. Our criminal law protects us from such things and we can bring civil claims against anyone who harms us like that. We don’t deport people to places where they will be tortured either.

The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat at odds with the Trump administration, says the state officers are simply keeping protesters safe from overzealous feds while protecting their First Amendment rights. But some demonstrators say Illinois troopers are now effectively shielding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement outpost in suburban Broadview.

Previously, disruptors have blocked access to the ICE facility, prompting federal authorities to use crowd-control methods, such as tear gas, to disperse mobs. Over the weekend, the Illinois State Police has been moving crowds back with wooden batons, herding them behind concrete barriers that are meant to keep the street clear.

Protesters like Ranell Conine told NewsNation they are confused by the disconnect between Pritzker’s public comments about the Trump administration and his use of state police to protect ICE.

“I think (Pritzker) needs to come and see the way that citizens are being treated and the way that our right to protest is being oppressed and challenged,” she said on Saturday.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said state authorities are not hiding behind masks in Broadview, in contrast with federal agents.

“They show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois,” the spokesperson said.

Tory plans announced on Sunday would see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.
The proposal is modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which the Conservatives said had provided a “successful approach” in removing illegal immigrants.
The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan” announced at the start of the party’s annual conference on Sunday.
Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.","The Conservatives will pledge to create a new ""Removals Force"", modelled on US immigration enforcement, which would be tasked with deporting 150,000 people a year as part of plans to detain and deport illegal immigrants.

The force would be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

Tory plans announced on Sunday would see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

The proposal is modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which the Conservatives said had provided a “successful approach” in removing illegal immigrants.

But ICE has also been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and US citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan” announced at the start of the party’s annual conference on Sunday.

Immigration is set to be one of the key themes of the annual gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre in Manchester.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system which would see refugee status granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants and arguing there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The plan follows the Tories’ announcement that they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if it won the next election, arguing the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

It also comes as Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – that has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/1eAGm5cXqvdfm19D55VGfq/c056372af97df1cc03062fac2deb6384/PA-81876547.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80,N,,2025-10-06 00:56:52.798489

Earlier this year, Trump also sent Guard personnel into Washington, D.C.
Go deeper: Trump administration appeals Portland Guard deployment ruling Editor's note: This story has been updated with statements from the White House, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell and local officials.","The Trump administration sent hundreds of federalized personnel from the California National Guard to Portland, Oregon, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said and the White House confirmed Sunday.

The big picture: The move, which Newsom says he'll sue over, comes the day after a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration's deployment of Oregon troops, saying the government had failed to prove immigration-related protests in the area couldn't be handled by local law enforcement.

The latest: While Newsom said 300 California National Guard members would be deployed, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told Axios Sunday evenining that about 200 troops would be sent from the state to Portland.

They're ""being reassigned from duty in the greater Los Angeles area"" to the city to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ""and other federal personnel performing official duties, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" he said.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield (D) said the state is ""preparing to take legal action"" over the move.

Driving the news: State and local officials have slammed Trump's directive to send federal troops into the city as unnecessary and dangerous.

Newsom said in a Sunday statement that the personnel are on their way now, calling the administration's action ""a breathtaking abuse of the law and power.""

""This isn't about public safety, it's about power,"" Newsom's statement continued. ""The commander-in-chief is using the U.S. military as a political weapon against American citizens.""

However, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to Axios: ""President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement.""

Friction point: The bitter feud between Trump and the California governor was escalated this summer when the president mobilized thousands of Guard troops and hundreds of Marines in response to Los Angeles-area protests.

Earlier this year, Trump also sent Guard personnel into Washington, D.C. He'd repeatedly teased sending troops to Chicago — before eventually moving Saturday to call up 300 National Guard members in Illinois.

Catch up quick: U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, on Saturday granted a temporary restraining order that halted the deployment of Oregon National Guard members to Portland.

She noted in her order that the ""protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days—or even weeks—leading up to the President's directive"" and said Trump's ""determination was simply untethered to the facts.""

Soon after, the administration filed a notice of appeal to challenge the decision.

Local officials have pushed back on the administration's characterization of what's happened at demonstrations at a South Portland facility, saying they've been relatively small and easily handled by local police, Axios' Kale Williams reported.

What they're saying: Gov. Tina Kotek (D) said in a statement that her administration is aware of 101 Guard members who arrived in Oregon Saturday night and that they believed more were on the way Sunday. She added she had yet to receive any official notification from the federal government.

""The facts haven't changed,"" her statement read. ""There is no need for military intervention in Oregon. There is no insurrection in Portland.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said the administration's move ""circumvents the court's decision and threatens to inflame a community that has remained peaceful.""

The other side: Trump on Sunday said Immergut ""ought to be ashamed.""

He told reporters outside of the White House, ""I appointed the judge, and he goes like that."" Immergut is a woman.

Pritzker’s directive was issued Friday after reports emerged that armed federal immigration agents descended on an apartment building on the South Side of Chicago on September 30 and pulled men, women, and children from their beds in the middle of the night.

In an interview with CNN Sunday, the governor cited reports of “children who were zip-tied and held, some of them nearly naked” and “elderly people being thrown into a U-Haul for three hours and detained.” At least one U.S. citizen was detained, Pritzker added.

Federal agents were “just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Mr. Pritzker added.

Witnesses told WBEZ Chicago and the Chicago Sun Times that armed agents arrived at the five-story building with U-Hauls and broke down residents’ doors, dragging them out of bed. Some told CNN that a Black Hawk helicopter was flying above the apartment complex.

“Imagine being a child awakened in the middle of the night by a Black Hawk helicopter landing in your neighborhood,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Imagine an armed stranger forcibly removing you from your bed, zip-tying your hands, separating you from your family, and detaining you in a dark van for hours. This didn’t happen in a country with an authoritarian regime – it happened here in Chicago.”

Pritzker said he was “appalled” by the reports and that “military-style tactics should never be used on children.”

The Independent has asked the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Federal agents and officers with the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol, the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives were involved in the immigration raid. Authorities said the neighborhood where the raid was conducted was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members and their associates.”

Eboni Watson, a resident of the building, told WLS that children appeared “terrified” during the raid.

“The kids was crying. People was screaming. They looked very distraught,” Watson said.

“I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids down, too, had them zip tied to each other,” Watson added.

Approximately 37 people were arrested in the September 30 raid, some of whom had criminal records related to drug or weapons crimes, DHS said.

Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.","President Donald Trump’s clash with Oregon escalated after about 100 California National Guard members were deployed to the Pacific Northwest state, despite a court order holding that isolated protests in Portland did not justify the use of federalized troops.

The troops arrived Saturday night with no prior notice to state officials, and more troops are on the way, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek said in a statement Sunday.

Oregon officials said they were going to return to federal court Monday because the 14-day restraining order from US District Judge Karin Immergut only stopped the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops. The state’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said in a news conference that California was joining Oregon’s lawsuit to stop the deployment of the California Guard.

Troops were ordered to Illinois in a similar manner.

Rayfield and Kotek told reporters they hoped US District Judge Karin Immergut would rule Monday on their request, which is the same day the Trump administration is appealing her Saturday ruling.

“The president is trying to out-hustle us” in this process, Rayfield said.

The Trump administration has said that federalized troops are needed to protect immigration officers from protesters in Democratic-run cities, even as local officials said demonstrations have been modest and largely peaceful.

“There is no need for military intervention in Oregon,” Kotek said in the statement. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. Oregon is our home, not a military target.”

The move marks another dramatic escalation in Trump’s campaign to federalize law enforcement in Democratic cities, with his administration now trying to find ways around federal court orders. Trump has already deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Memphis, with varying goals of protecting federal property and fighting crime.

Protests in Portland began in June when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents started arresting undocumented immigrants as they appeared in court for procedural hearings. The sporadic protests have focused on a single ICE facility outside downtown, a far cry from the often violent protests that rocked Portland during social-justice protests in 2020.

Nevertheless, Trump called Portland “war-ravaged” and said Sunday the city was “burning to the ground.”

Kotek countered that description on Sunday, noting that the protest was confined to one city block and that the Portland Marathon had occurred that day.

“Thousands of people running 26 miles through the streets of Portland — clearly not a war zone,” she said. “We cannot normalize the approach he is taking with the military in our country.”

The deployment of California troops to Oregon came hours after a Trump-appointed federal judge in Portland issued a strongly worded court order temporarily blocking the administration’s plan to call up 200 Oregon National Guard members to the state’s largest city.

Immergut concluded there was no justification for the deployment. She cited the limited nature of the protests and the ability of local law enforcement to handle the situation, which typically involved about 20 protesters at a time in recent weeks. The judge also said that the deployment risks “blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request to confirm the deployment, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Sunday that the federal government expects to win its appeal of the Portland judge’s order.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Jackson said. California Governor Gavin Newsom, she said, “should stand on the side of law-abiding citizens instead of violent criminals destroying Portland and cities across the country.”

Rayfield said Trump is falsely portraying Portland as a war zone to justify sending in federalized troops.

“This president is obviously hellbent on deploying the military in American cities, absent facts or authority to do so,” Rayfield said earlier in a statement. “It is up to us and the courts to hold him accountable. That’s what we intend to do.”

Newsom has already clashed with the administration over Trump’s federalization of the California National Guard in June in Los Angeles.

“Despite a federal court order finding no legal basis to deploy state National Guard troops to the streets of Portland and ordering that control of the Oregon National Guard be returned to state command, the Trump administration is now sending 300 federally controlled members of the California National Guard to Portland to take their place,” Newsom said in a statement.

The judge said there were no facts to support Trump’s claims that Portland was “war-ravaged” and that anarchists and professional agitators were trying to burn down federal property and other buildings.

“The president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

Immergut agreed that courts should give great deference to the president in making such decisions, but she disagreed that Trump had made his determination about Portland in good faith and ruled that deference “is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.”

Trump also ordered 300 National Guard troops to Illinois on Saturday on a similar rationale, over the objections of Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, who called the move “un-American.”

Illinois received no prior notice from the White House about the deployment, said a Pritzker spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity. The spokesperson added that the Illinois National Guard informed the Pentagon that the situation does not require the use of the military and reiterated its objection to the deployment.

The California National Guard was federalized in June for 90 days, when Trump first started using military troops to help combat what he claims is high crime and to protect federal agents carrying out his deportation actions. Trump was attempting to federalize the California Guard for another 90 days, according to the California Department of Justice.

The Memphis deployment was conducted with the agreement of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.

Democrats are demanding a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Donald Trump and the Republicans enacted over the summer—and a renewal of a temporary boost to Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December.
It’s a cut to a Medicaid provision known commonly as “Emergency Medicaid” that reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they end up providing to undocumented immigrants.
If the administration is so opposed to illegal immigrants getting subsidized health care, would it support overturning the EMTALA requirement?
There are some morally important, politically relevant reasons behind the obligation to provide emergency treatment to undocumented immigrants—as well as for a federal program to finance that care.","WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY Karoline Leavitt on Thursday got a question she didn’t seem prepared to answer, about a law she may not have expected to be discussing.

It is known as EMTALA, which stands for the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. If you’ve ever been sitting in an emergency room, staring at the walls, you may have seen one of the posters explaining EMTALA’s guarantee: Hospitals must provide stabilizing or life-saving care to anybody who needs it, no matter who they are or whether they can pay.

The law has been on the books since the 1980s. And although EMTALA pops up in political fights from time to time, there was no reason to think it’d become a major subplot of the government shutdown story. But then the shutdown turned into an argument over health care policy.

Democrats are demanding a reversal of Medicaid cuts that Donald Trump and the Republicans enacted over the summer—and a renewal of a temporary boost to Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December. Trump and the Republicans are not inclined to take either step. And to get the public on their side, they’ve been arguing the real Democratic agenda is different—that, as Vice President JD Vance posted on X Thursday, “Democrats shut down the government to give health care money to illegal aliens.”

The problem for Republicans is that most of the Democratic demands have nothing to do with immigration, while the portion that does deals almost entirely with people here lawfully. As critics have called out the lie, Vance and his allies have retreated to a narrower argument about one tiny item on the list of cuts Democrats would reverse. It’s a cut to a Medicaid provision known commonly as “Emergency Medicaid” that reimburses hospitals for the emergency care they end up providing to undocumented immigrants.

EMTALA is the reason hospitals have to provide that care in the first place, so it was only a matter of time before Leavitt got the query she faced Thursday. If the administration is so opposed to illegal immigrants getting subsidized health care, would it support overturning the EMTALA requirement? Or, as the NBC News reporter who asked the question put it: “Should ERs check immigration status before treating a dying patient?”

“That’s probably not a question for me to answer,” Leavitt responded. “That’s a question for health care professionals and legal experts to answer.”

But it was a perfectly appropriate question for Leavitt, as it would have been for Vance or for any other Republican who used Emergency Medicaid funding as a cudgel against the Democrats last week. There are some morally important, politically relevant reasons behind the obligation to provide emergency treatment to undocumented immigrants—as well as for a federal program to finance that care.

And the best way to understand those reasons is to revisit the circumstances forty years ago that led to the creation of both.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZFCX!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6105cb7-5e4f-4c8e-aa52-7716ec7ac567_2100x1500.jpeg",N,,2025-10-05 21:56:26.853749

In other words, the idea that deportation was refused simply because of a child’s aversion to chicken nuggets was always misleading.

Over a longer time frame, it may also be possible to work with others to reform the text of the ECHR.
Leaving the ECHR would be a high-risk policy, damaging to our international standing and, at best, irrelevant in tackling illegal immigration.","Except that is not quite what happened. Evidence was put forward in the initial tribunal hearing that the father and son had a very close relationship, that the son had special needs and was emotionally fragile, and, in a long list of reasons why the boy would struggle to cope if moved to Albania, his mother mentioned that small changes to his food causes him to “seize up” and refuse to eat. A specific example was given by the mother that the boy refuses to eat the type of chicken nuggets available abroad.

• A sitting ovation for Kemi Badenoch, but they stood up for Philp

The judge in the first-tier tribunal considered the impact that either separation from his father or moving to Albania would have on the boy, set out the arguments on which he placed weight (making no explicit reference to chicken nuggets) and concluded that deportation of the father involved a breach of the son’s ECHR rights.

In other words, the idea that deportation was refused simply because of a child’s aversion to chicken nuggets was always misleading. Except even that is far from being the whole story. The Home Office appealed against the decision and won: the upper-tier tribunal rejected the conclusion that there was a breach of the boy’s Article 8 rights at all.

It was only after this second judgment was published that the so-called chicken nuggets case attracted attention as an example of how the ECHR stopped deportations — even though the case was never about chicken nuggets and, by the time it was being reported, the finding against deportation had been overturned.

When a judgment in one of these cases sounds too bad to be true, it probably isn’t true. As with the case above, a first-tier tribunal decision might be reported even though it has been overturned. A detail from the case might be presented as decisive when it was merely incidental. Another area of misleading reporting is when an argument made by the person facing deportation (or their lawyer) is quoted as being the basis of a judicial decision even if it is not.

• Russell Findlay backs Badenoch’s call to leave ECHR

A better way of assessing whether the ECHR is an impediment to an effective deportation regime is to look at the data. A recent academic study by the University of Oxford did precisely that. It found that the latest available Home Office statistics show the number of successful human rights-based appeals against deportation is very small compared with the number of foreign national offenders who are deported, at around 3.5 per cent (and some of those cases will have been overturned on appeal).

That is the evidence from the UK courts, but what about successful appeals to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg? Again, the data does not suggest that this is a serious impediment in deporting foreign national offenders. There have been 29 cases involving deportations from the UK heard by the Strasbourg court since 1980 and the UK has won 16 of them. None of the 13 defeats has been in the past five years.

We might still conclude, even though the oft-quoted cases about the problems caused by the ECHR are misleading and the data suggests this is a relatively small issue, that something must be done. It does not follow, however, that we must leave the ECHR. When it comes to interpreting the relevant ECHR articles, our courts consider guidance set out by parliament. The home secretary has set out her intention to tighten this guidance. Over a longer time frame, it may also be possible to work with others to reform the text of the ECHR.

Instead, the Conservatives have followed Reform UK into advocating full withdrawal. It is a policy that, at the very least, complicates the workings of the Good Friday agreement and our post-Brexit deal with the EU, results in us leaving the Council of Europe (following in the footsteps of Russia and Belarus), and leaves us more isolated, thereby making it harder to work with other European countries to tackle illegal immigration. Leaving the ECHR would be a high-risk policy, damaging to our international standing and, at best, irrelevant in tackling illegal immigration. That such a policy is justified by misleading and spurious claims only makes matters worse.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fad8f749f-3c01-414f-b922-7b0733d13ed6.jpg?crop=1214%2C683%2C219%2C122&resize=1200,N,,2025-10-05 19:56:32.840286

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that’s raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,” the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. “They never brought one.”

Dixon Romero with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who’d broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

A future Conservative government would be open to the possibility of amending or quitting other international agreements, Badenoch said, opening the possibility of the UK leaving the UN’s 1951 refugee convention.
Leaving the ECHR was “a necessary step, but not enough on its own to achieve our goals”, she said.
“If there are other treaties and laws we need to revise or revisit, then we will do so.
The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.","A future Tory government would be open to dismantling more treaties as a means to deport people from the UK, Kemi Badenoch has said at the start of a Conservative party conference focused almost exclusively on immigration policy.

Making the first of two addresses to the gathering in Manchester, the Tory leader formally set out her proposal for the UK to quit the European convention on human rights (ECHR) as part of a wider bonfire of protections including an end to legal aid in immigration and asylum cases and the right to take migration decisions to tribunals or judicial review.

A future Conservative government would be open to the possibility of amending or quitting other international agreements, Badenoch said, opening the possibility of the UK leaving the UN’s 1951 refugee convention.

Leaving the ECHR was “a necessary step, but not enough on its own to achieve our goals”, she said. “If there are other treaties and laws we need to revise or revisit, then we will do so. And we will do so in the same calm and responsible way, working out the detail before we rush to announce.”

The plan to leave the ECHR was announced just before the conference as part of a radical and sometimes draconian package of anti-migration measures including a pledge that all asylum seekers arriving by unofficial means would be sent to their own or a third country within a week.

Another plan involves the formation of a “removals force”, billed as being modelled on Donald Trump’s semi-militarised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, with a remit to deport 150,000 people a year.

In a speech directly after Badenoch, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said that if a foreign national in the UK expressed “racial hatred, including antisemitism”, or supported “extremism or terrorism”, they would be deported.

It was not immediately clear whether this would apply only to people convicted of a crime for such actions. The Conservative party has already promised to deport any UK-based foreign nationals convicted of all but the most minor offences.

Unveiling the plan to leave the ECHR, Badenoch said this followed a review of the issue by Lord Wolfson, the shadow attorney general, who concluded the only feasible way to gain control of borders was to quit the treaty.

“And so to me and the shadow cabinet, the resulting policy decision is also clear,” she said. “We must leave the ECHR and repeal the Human Rights Act. Conference, I want you to know that the next Conservative manifesto will contain our commitment to leave.”

Badenoch said there would be “particular challenges in Northern Ireland”, where the ECHR is included in the Good Friday agreement. She said she would get Alex Burghart, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, “to examine this issue”.

The address contained no policies that had not been previously announced, with Badenoch repeating her mantra that the party needed to learn from its 2024 election defeat and take time to put together a cohesive platform.

“People won’t listen to us again unless we showed them we have learned from our mistakes and changed,” she said. Badenoch went on to take a swipe at Liz Truss’s mini-budget, saying: “We will never repeat the financial irresponsibility of spending commitments without saying where the money is coming from.”

Much of her conference speech and that of Philp’s were focused on migration, with the shadow home secretary in particular using large parts of his address to list a sequence of criminal offences committed by asylum seekers. “This is sick. We must do whatever it takes to end this madness,” Philp said.

He set out details of the new removals force, saying it would have twice the budget of the current system and be able to take advantage of the removal of many rights and avenues of appeal.

“Stripping away the legal obstacles, that I have described, and doubling that budget means we can remove 150,000 people a year that have no legal right to be here. That is three-quarters of a million over the course of the next parliament. This illegal immigration scandal will end.”

Badenoch took a similarly hard right tone in places, saying the UK had “tolerated the radical Islamist ideology” and that the country could not “import and tolerate values hostile to our own”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f2d65ab7cac70b499a2cae09abaaaf564fc2dd/3168_1621_5175_4139/master/5175.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ec2182f87c469d572fab4d8353cfc71",N,,2025-10-05 17:56:40.253906

Deploying chemical agents near a public school. Handcuffing a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Activists, residents and leaders say increasingly combative tactics used by federal immigration agents are sparking violence and fueling neighborhood tensions in the nation’s third-largest city.

“They are the ones that are making it a war zone,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday on CNN. “They fire tear gas and smoke grenades, and they make it look like it’s a war zone.”

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area. The Trump administration has also vowed to deploy National Guard troops in its agenda to boost deportations.

But U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters which pop up daily across neighborhoods in the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs.

Arriving by helicopter

Activists and residents were taking stock Sunday at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side where the Department of Homeland Security said 37 immigrants were arrested recently in an operation that's raised calls for investigation by Pritzker.

While federal agents have mostly focused on immigrant-heavy and Latino enclaves, the operation early Tuesday unfolded in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had a small influx of migrants resettled in Chicago while seeking asylum.

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them.

Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

Rodrick Johnson, a U.S. citizen briefly detained, said agents broke through his door and placed him in zip ties.

“I asked if they had a warrant, and I asked for a lawyer,"" the 67-year-old told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""They never brought one.”

Dixon Romero with Southside Together, an organization that’s also been helping residents, said doors were knocked off the hinges.

“Everyone we talked to didn’t feel safe,” he said. “This is not normal. It’s not OK. It’s not right.”

Pritzker, a two-term Democrat, directed state agencies to investigate claims that children were zip tied and detained separately from their parents, saying “military-style tactics” shouldn’t be used on children. Several Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation met near the site Sunday, calling for an end to immigration raids.

DHS officials said they were targeting connections to the Tren de Aragua gang. Without offering details on arrests or addressing how children were treated, DHS said “some of the targeted subjects are believed to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday posted heavily edited video clips of the operation to X showing agents blasting through doors, helicopters and adults in zip ties, but music played over most of the roughly 1 minute video.

Agency officials did not return a message left Sunday.

Brandon Lee, with ICIRR, said while some residents were placed on ankle monitors, others remained unaccounted for.

More tear gas and smoke bombs

Meanwhile, the use of chemical agents has become more frequent and visible in the past week. Used initially to manage protesters, agents used it this week on city streets and during immigration operations, according to ICIRR.

An emergency hotline to report immigrant agent sightings topped 800 calls on Friday, the same day activists said agents threw a cannister of a chemical near a school in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood. The activity in the northwest side neighborhood prompted nearby Funston Elementary School to hold recess indoors.

The same day Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes was placed in handcuffs at a hospital. She said she asked agents to show a warrant for a person who'd broken his leg while chased by ICE agents who then transported him to the emergency room.

“ICE acted like an invading army in our neighborhoods,” said state Rep. Lilian Jiménez, a Democrat. “Helicopters hovered above our homes, terrifying families and disturbing the peace of our community. These shameful and lawless actions are not only a violation of constitutional rights but of our most basic liberty: the right to live free from persecution and fear.”

Immigration agents shot a woman they allege was armed and tried to run them over after agents were “boxed in by 10 cars.” She and another person were charged Sunday with forcibly assaulting, impeding and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer. However, activists said immigration agents caused the multi-vehicle crash and detained the woman, who is a U.S. citizen.

Noem has defended the aggressive tactics, calling the mission treacherous to agents and alleging threats on officers’ lives.

“It’s an extremely dangerous situation,” she said Sunday on the “Fox & Friends” weekend show.

Going to court

Leaders of a Chicago suburb that’s home to an immigration processing center have taken their fight against federal agents to court.

The village of Broadview has become a front line in the immigration operation. The center in the community of 8,000 people is where immigrants are processed for detention or deportation.

Protests outside have become tense with near daily arrests. Civil rights organizations have blasted aggressive tactics by agents, while village officials have launched three separate criminal investigations against federal agents.

City officials have demanded the federal government remove an 8-foot fence they say was “illegally” put up outside the facility. They filed a federal lawsuit Friday seek a temporary restraining order and the immediate removal of the fence they say blocks fire access.

“The fence also constitutes an immediate public safety hazard,” the lawsuit said.

Also pending is an expected ruling on alleged violations of a 2022 consent decree on how federal immigration agents can make arrests in six states including Illinois. While the order expired in May, attorneys have sought an extension and filed dozens of more alleged violations in the past month.

Republicans — including Johnson on Sunday — argue that negotiations about the subsidies shouldn’t happen now, as they don’t expire until the end of December.","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Sunday accused Senate Democrats of not being “serious” about negotiating an end to the government shutdown.

“They’re not serious. This is not a serious negotiation. They’re doing this to get political cover,” Johnson told NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” accusing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of using the government shutdown as a ploy to help a future re-election bid.

Johnson also said that Senate Democrats are the reason the government shut down, accusing them of seeking to fund emergency health services for undocumented immigrants.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who appeared on “Meet the Press” just before Johnson, accused Republicans of being the driving force behind the ongoing government shutdown, saying that GOP leaders in Congress and President Donald Trump have gone “radio silent” in negotiations to reopen the government.

“The last time there was a conversation with Republican leadership was in the White House meeting last Monday. And unfortunately, since that point in time, Republicans, including Donald Trump, have gone radio silent,” Jeffries told “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker.

“What we’ve seen is negotiation through deepfake videos, the House canceling votes and, of course, President Trump spending yesterday on the golf course. That’s not responsible behavior,” the minority leader added, pointing to AI-generated videos Trump has posted online of his political foes, including Jeffries.

Later in the interview, Jeffries responded more directly to the president’s posts that included AI-generated images and videos of the minority leader, calling them “outrageous, “unhinged” and “unreasonable.”

“The American people deserve better than lies, than attacks, than deepfake videos,” he added.

Johnson’s and Jeffries’ comments come as the federal government is set to enter the sixth day of a government shutdown on Monday because Congress has not successfully appropriated the funds to keep it open.

In a separate interview Sunday on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cast doubt on the idea that the shutdown could end soon, saying it was up to Democrats to decide on the length of the shut down.

""I think it’s just as long as the Democrats want it to go on. I mean, they’re the ones — they have the control, the controlling card right now ... It’s simply, are the Democrats going to open up the government or aren’t they?” he said when asked about how long the shutdown could drag on.

Thune also said that he hopes ""reasonable"" Senate Democrats will vote alongside Republicans this week on a GOP-backed bill to reopen the government, but didn't name any Democrats who are leaning toward that.

""There are reasonable Democrats out there who are having conversations with Republicans, and I’m hopeful those are going to yield some results,” the majority leader added.

House lawmakers were set to return to Washington this week for the first time since Sept. 19, but late Friday, Johnson canceled the votes that were set to occur this week, labeling the week a district work period instead.

Republicans and Democrats are still at a stalemate in the Senate, which held votes Friday on a Democratic-backed plan and a Republican-backed plan to temporarily fund the government. Neither plan received the 60 votes needed to move forward.

Before they left town in September, House Republicans passed a stopgap funding measure that would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21. Just one House Democrat — Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine — joined his GOP colleagues in voting for that bill.

But that temporary funding bill has stalled in the Senate, where the bills have failed multiple times to clear the 60-vote threshold, with a majority of Democratic senators voting against it.

Johnson on Sunday pointed to those votes as the cause of the shutdown, telling Welker, “The reason the government is closed is because Chuck Schumer and 43 of his Democrat colleagues in the Senate have decided now to vote multiple times to keep the government closed. We need them to turn the lights back on so that everyone can do their work.”

“The House did our work,” Johnson added. “We passed a bipartisan, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open. And what did Chuck Schumer send back in response? His counterproposal would add $1.5 trillion in new spending for a simple seven-week stopgap funding measure to keep the government open.”

Senate Democrats have proposed their own temporary funding measure that would fund the government through Oct. 31. It would also restore previous GOP cuts to Medicaid and extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.

Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to give Medicaid access to undocumented immigrants — something that is already prohibited under previous laws — in that bill.

Jeffries, in his interview, accused Republicans of “lying” on that point “because they’re losing in the court of public opinion as it relates to what’s going on right now.”

He added that Democrats “are standing up for the health care of hardworking American taxpayers, of working-class Americans, of middle-class Americans and everyday Americans.”

Jeffries also said that “federal law clearly prohibits the expenditure of taxpayer dollars to provide health care to undocumented immigrants, period, full stop, and no Democrat on Capitol Hill is trying to change that law.”

Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year have been at the center of the debate over funding the government. Republicans — including Johnson on Sunday — argue that negotiations about the subsidies shouldn’t happen now, as they don’t expire until the end of December.

“We have plenty of time to figure that out, because, again, it doesn’t expire until the end of the year,” the speaker told Welker.

Democrats, on the other hand, argue that the time to negotiate on the subsidies is now, before open enrollment for health care plans begins in early November.

The two leaders also spoke about the Trump administration’s plan to conduct mass layoffs of federal workers during the government shutdown. Multiple administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance last week, have blamed Democrats for fueling the layoffs.

“In a situation like this, where the Senate Democrats have decided to turn the keys to the kingdom over to the to the White House, they have to make tough decisions. Russ Vought runs the Office of Management and Budget,” Johnson said. “He has to now look at all of the federal government, recognizing that the funding streams have been turned off, and determine what are essential programs, policies and personnel. That’s that’s not a job that he relishes, but he’s being required to do it by Chuck Schumer.”

In a separate interview later Sunday on CNN, Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett confirmed that the administration still planned to fire some furloughed federal workers.

""If the president decides that the negotiations are absolutely going nowhere, then there will be layoffs,"" Hassett said. ""I think that everybody's still hopeful that when we get a fresh start at the beginning of the week, that we can get the Democrats to see that it's just common sense to avoid layoffs like that.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251002-mike-johnson-gk-f7cade.jpg",N,,2025-10-05 16:56:48.309982

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.

A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. The court joined the four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The 14th Amendment

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily -- and by extension, their children -- cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats -- both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority -- were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

Supreme Court rulings

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Lower court decisions

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

""The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,"" Chief Judge David Barron wrote. ""It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.""

White House response

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to ""being vindicated by the Supreme Court.""

To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.",https://cdn.mainichi.jp/vol1/2025/10/05/20251005p2g00m0in030000p/0c10.jpg?1,N,,2025-10-05 20:57:12.451297

The matter of the Epstein files has for months been a thorn in the side of the president and his allies in Congress.
Another complication, both for the petition and Grijalva’s hopes to taking her seat: the House was out of session all this week.
No luck, even though Johnson administered the oath to two Republicans who won special elections in Florida during a similar session earlier this year.
“That doesn’t make sense, why I wouldn’t be sworn in, in the same pace that they were?” Grijalva said.","Congress’s newest member, Adelita Grijalva, came to Washington DC this week, expecting to be officially sworn in by the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson.

Two days later, she returned to her southern Arizona district disappointed, if not a little confused. No swearing-in ceremony had been organized, meaning Grijalva, a Democrat who easily won a special election last month to replace her late father, Raúl M Grijalva, was not able to start her new job.

Trapped in the purgatorial status of representative-elect, she had to be escorted around the Capitol building by her soon-to-be-colleagues, like any other member of the public. Her name is on the door of her new office, but she does not have the keys.

“I want to get to work and I can’t,” Grijalva said.

She thinks she knows the reason why Johnson is in no rush to administer the oath: in addition to co-sponsoring bills on the environment, public education and other issues she campaigned on addressing, Grijalva plans to provide the final signature on a petition that would force a vote on legislation to release files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein – which the speaker and Donald Trump oppose.

“I can’t think of any other reason. It’s not like my being sworn in changes the majority,” she said.

The matter of the Epstein files has for months been a thorn in the side of the president and his allies in Congress. Though Trump has decried it as a “Democrat hoax”, a small group of dissident Republicans have joined with all of the Democrats in the House of Representatives to pursue the legislative maneuver, known as a discharge petition. It just needs the signatures of 218 lawmakers to succeed, and has currently received 217 – Grijalva’s would be the last one.

The petition is a rare instance of defiance among congressional Republicans, who have given Trump much of what he wants ever since he returned to the White House. But even if it succeeds and the legislation passes the House, it is unlikely to go far. The Senate’s Republican leaders have shown little interest in the issue, and it is difficult to imagine Trump signing the bill.

Another complication, both for the petition and Grijalva’s hopes to taking her seat: the House was out of session all this week. Johnson last month called off planned work days to pressure Senate Democrats into voting for legislation the chamber has approved to fund the government and end the ongoing shutdown.

However, the House did hold a three-and-a-half-minute procedural session on Tuesday – one Grijalva attended along with dozens of Democrats, in hopes of getting Johnson to swear her in. No luck, even though Johnson administered the oath to two Republicans who won special elections in Florida during a similar session earlier this year.

“That doesn’t make sense, why I wouldn’t be sworn in, in the same pace that they were?” Grijalva said. “And who is losing out are the constituents that need a Congress to work for them.”

A spokesperson for Johnson pointed to his comments signaling that Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session, but that will not happen until funding is restored to the government.

“The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government,” Johnson said today, referring to the top Senate Democrat whom the Republicans blame for the funding lapse.

Grijalva along with her family had planned to be in Washington again by Tuesday of next week, in hopes the House would be back to work. On Friday afternoon, Johnson announced that it would take the whole week off.

“Now I have to change, blow up all of the travel plans that I made for everybody,” she said. “So, that’s frustrating.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945f4aefad55a59385ab8763cbadd1182cfcd379/222_0_6266_5013/master/6266.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae1984b8d2ab36d709613ed54d9ec317",N,,2025-10-05 15:57:42.534036

According to Badenoch, the Removals Force will have a mandate to remove all illegal entrants, foreign criminals, and undocumented migrants, while also monitoring illegal work.
Instead, in just a year, they delivered record small boat crossings, over 50,000 illegal arrivals, 32,000 people in asylum hotels, billions wasted.
Badenoch’s announcement has intensified the ongoing debate in the UK over immigration policy, balancing border security with human rights considerations.
Critics have expressed concern over the repeal of the Human Rights Act and the use of facial recognition technology without oversight, while supporters have welcomed the proposed measures as a decisive step in tackling illegal immigration.","Kemi Badenoch, leader of the United Kingdom’s Conservative Party, has unveiled an aggressive immigration reform plan aimed at detaining and deporting 150,000 illegal migrants annually, in what she described as the “toughest reforms Britain has ever seen” in border policy. The announcement was made in a video message posted on her X account on Sunday.

The plan, dubbed the Radical Borders Plan, envisages the establishment of a new Removals Force modelled after the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which would replace the current Home Office Immigration Enforcement unit. According to Badenoch, the Removals Force will have a mandate to remove all illegal entrants, foreign criminals, and undocumented migrants, while also monitoring illegal work. She stated, “My message is clear: if you’re here illegally, you will be detained and deported.”

Badenoch sharply criticised previous administrations, accusing both Conservative and Labour governments of failing to manage the migration crisis effectively. “Successive governments have failed on immigration. Labour promised to smash the gangs. Instead, in just a year, they delivered record small boat crossings, over 50,000 illegal arrivals, 32,000 people in asylum hotels, billions wasted. It’s pure weakness. Britain needs a serious, credible plan and the backbone to deliver it,” she said.

The proposed plan includes several controversial measures. Asylum claims from illegal entrants would be banned, the Human Rights Act repealed, and the United Kingdom withdrawn from the European Convention on Human Rights. Badenoch added that all new illegal arrivals would be deported within a week, with legal obstacles to mass removals removed and visa sanctions imposed on countries that refuse to repatriate their citizens. She also pledged to “shut down the asylum hotel racket,” which she said would save taxpayers billions and restore public confidence in the UK’s border controls.

The Removals Force, if approved, will operate with an annual budget of £1.6 billion, double that of the current Immigration Enforcement unit, funded by savings from the closure of asylum hotels and other measures within the asylum system. The force will have sweeping powers, including the use of facial recognition technology without prior warning, and will integrate closely with the police. Priority for removals will include new illegal entrants, foreign criminals, failed asylum seekers, visa over-stayers, and others identified as residing in the UK illegally.

In an interview on BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Badenoch faced criticism for her refusal to specify the destinations to which deported migrants would be sent. She responded, “I’m tired of all of these irrelevant questions about where they should go. They will go back to where they should be or another country, but they should not be here.” When pressed further, she added, “They will go back to where they came from.”

According to the Conservative Party document detailing the plan, the proposed measures are intended to increase removals from the current 34,000 per year to approximately 150,000, marking a five-fold increase in enforcement activity. The party argues that the reforms are necessary to address what it describes as uncontrolled migration and to strengthen public trust in the country’s border system.

Badenoch’s announcement has intensified the ongoing debate in the UK over immigration policy, balancing border security with human rights considerations. Critics have expressed concern over the repeal of the Human Rights Act and the use of facial recognition technology without oversight, while supporters have welcomed the proposed measures as a decisive step in tackling illegal immigration.

""We've told Liberals that their current Bill C-2 will not pass unless they remove the violations of Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy,"" Poilievre said in an interview with CBC News.
Poilievre said law enforcement officials are still able to do searches — including searching mail — but they need a warrant to do so.
In a minority Parliament, the Liberals need votes from at least one other party to pass legislation.

""We've told Liberals that their current Bill C-2 will not pass unless they remove the violations of Canadians' individual freedoms and privacy,"" Poilievre said in an interview with CBC News.

""We don't think that law-abiding Canadians should lose their liberty to pay for the failures of the Liberals on borders and immigration.""

The Strong Borders Act, known as C-2, is a marquee piece of Liberal government legislation, introduced in the spring sitting in part as an effort to persuade the Trump administration that its concerns about border security — used to justify tariffs — were unwarranted.

Government House Leader Steven MacKinnon has said it's about ""ensuring law enforcement has the tools to keep our border secure,"" but civil rights groups and privacy experts criticized it, saying some provisions appear to go far beyond the stated aims of the legislation.

The 140-page proposed law includes sweeping powers for security and intelligence services, including expanding the ability to open and inspect mail and allowing officials to cancel or suspend immigration documents.

Bill C-2 also proposes giving police the ability to demand subscriber information from internet providers and other online companies — which could amount to law enforcement asking an internet company about a customer's online activity without a warrant.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has said such information provides ""a trove of background about our lives"" and questioned whether such a bill is compliant with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Conservatives had previously expressed concerns about ""snooping provisions"" in the bill, and on Friday, Poilievre confirmed his party will not support the existing bill and called on the Liberals to introduce a new piece of legislation.

""We've said to them that there's no way they're going to be able to pass their current bill, C-2, which attacks the freedoms and the privacy of Canadians,"" he said.

""They should reintroduce a new bill that focuses on law breakers, on restoring order at the border, on kicking out fraudulent refugees, while at the same time allowing people to send mail, use the internet or do legitimate lawful cash transactions.""

Poilievre said law enforcement officials are still able to do searches — including searching mail — but they need a warrant to do so.

""Mail is the easiest thing to get a warrant for. If you suspect there's something suspicious in a parcel or envelope, you set it aside, you go to a judge and you get a warrant. The envelope or parcel is not going to grow legs and run away,"" he said.

In a minority Parliament, the Liberals need votes from at least one other party to pass legislation. The New Democrats, the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party have expressed similar concerns about government overreach.

U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to not detain any child who came to the country alone and without permission in ICE adult detention facilities after they become an adult.

The Washington, D.C., judge found that such automatic detention violates a court order he issued in 2021 barring such practices.

ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond Saturday to emails seeking comment.

The push to detain new adults is yet another battle over one of the most sensitive issues in President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda — how to treat children who cross the border unaccompanied by adults.

The Associated Press reported Friday that officials are offering migrant children age 14 and older $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries. Last month a separate federal judge blocked attempts to immediately deport Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country. Some children had been put on board planes in that late-night operation before a judge blocked it.

“All of these are pieces of the same general policy to coerce immigrant youth into giving up their right to seek protection in the United States,” said Michelle Lapointe, a lawyer for the American Immigration Council, one of the groups that asked Contreras to intervene in a filing made just after midnight Saturday.

Unaccompanied children are held in shelters run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, under not ICE but the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. Contreras’ 2021 order instructed federal officials to release minors who turn 18 from those shelters to “the least restrictive setting available.” He ruled that is what is required by federal law as long as the minor isn’t a danger to themselves or others and isn’t a flight risk. Minors are often released to the custody of a relative, or maybe into foster care.

But lawyers who represent unaccompanied minors said they began getting word in the last few days that ICE was telling shelters that children who were about to turn 18 — even those who had already-approved release plans — could no longer be released and would instead be taken to detention facilities, possibly as early as Saturday. One email from ICE asserted that the new adults could only be released by ICE under its case-by-case parole authority for “urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit.” From March through September, ICE has paroled fewer than 500 people overall.

The plaintiffs argued that “release on parole is all but a dead letter” and that children aging out of shelters would experience lasting harm from “unnecessary and inappropriate adult detention” in jails that might be overcrowded or in remote locations. The plaintiffs said that was especially true because some of the clients they cited had been victims of trafficking or had been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents.

U.S. border authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021. A 2008 law requires them to appear before an immigration judge before being returned to their countries.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters since the Trump administration put them under closer scrutiny before releasing them to family in the United States to pursue their immigration cases.

The additional scrutiny includes fingerprinting, DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers. Over the summer, immigration officers started showing up and arresting parents.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/d210b0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3078+0+148/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F3f%2F9f%2Fce064532b019755ea8dfafcc7239%2F162bdd7bbd394aabac1a8f53ab8e12d3,N,,2025-10-05 15:57:51.453154

Trump has deployed National Guard troops to other Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles and Washington, moves that are being challenged in court.

A Trump-appointed federal judge over the weekend stopped the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, while a lawsuit on the matter winds through court.

Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants.","For months, as Donald Trump has used the levers of the US federal government to consolidate power, silence dissent and punish his political enemies, Democrats have been bombarded with a single demand: do something. Last week, they did.

In a rare display of unity, out-of-power Democrats embraced the risky politics of a government shutdown – their boldest effort yet to rein in a president whom many Americans and constitutional scholars now view as a threat to US democracy.

“It’s not a fight for fighting’s sake,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, one of the outside groups closely coordinating with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. “This is a battle about Donald Trump’s attacks on the constitution and him seizing the power over all spending from Congress – and whether Congress is going to let him get away with that.”

Washington is bracing for what could be an extended government shutdown, which officially began at 12.01am on Wednesday. Last week, Senate Democrats repeatedly blocked a Republican funding measure to reopen the government, as the parties traded blame and each side insisted they would not bend to the other’s demands.

Democrats are pressing for an array of healthcare-centered priorities, including the extension of tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans set to expire at the end of the year. The White House and Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have refused to include any healthcare concessions as part of a deal to reopen the government, though some GOP lawmakers are open to extending the ACA subsidies.

Democrats, with little leverage and deep skepticism that Republicans will honor any future deal, view the shutdown as their only option to force the issue.

But the Trump administration is working to make the closures as painful as possible for Democrats, who Republicans accuse of trying to “sabotage” the president’s agenda.

Trump has called the shutdown an “unprecedented opportunity” to dismantle federal programs and what he called “Democrat agencies”. In a sharp break from precedent, the Trump administration is readying plans to permanently layoffs of federal workers while it takes punitive action against Democratic-led states. Several government departments have posted partisan and potentially illegal messages saying their operations are curtailed due to “the Radical Left Democrat shutdown”. In the Senate, the majority leader John Thune has said he plans to hold more votes on a plan to reopen the government this week.

But Democrats say the stakes are too high – and the greater risk is capitulating to the president.

“Remember, right now, our healthcare system is broken. Right now, we’re the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,” the senator Bernie Sanders said in a video with progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, explaining the Democrats’ opposition to the Republican funding bill. “And these guys want to make it even worse. We’re not going to let that happen.”

Progressive activists who have been sharply critical of the party’s congressional leaders, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, are now praising them for continuing to “hold the line on healthcare”.

“What our members see is Democrats willing to stand up and fight,” said Joel Payne, a spokesperson for MoveOn, which is part of a coalition of progressive groups flooding Democrats with calls to hold fast in shutdown negotiations.

Payne said healthcare was Democrats’ “north star” – the party’s strongest issue with voters and one that has helped propel them to victory in the past. If Democrats are successful, he added, the showdown over healthcare could serve as a blueprint for safeguarding other rights under attack by the administration.

House Republicans did not need Democrats to pass their short-term spending bill last month, which would fund the government mostly at current levels through 21 November. But in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, they need Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation.

So far, only three members of the Senate Democratic caucus have broken ranks: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King, an independent of Maine.

In the House, Maine congressman Jared Golden, was only House Democrat to back the Republican funding bill when it passed the House last month. In a statement last week, Golden said the shutdown was the “result of hardball politics” driven by the demands of “far-left groups” eager to show their opposition to Trump.

Early polling suggests voters are more inclined to blame Trump and Republicans than Democrats for the federal shutdown. A Washington Post poll released on Thursday found that, by a 17-percentage-point margin, Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown. Independents overwhelmingly sided with Democrats, the survey found.

Yet there were signs public opinion could shift as more Americans face the ripple effects of government-wide closures. In several polls, a significant share of voters said they held both parties equally responsible or were unsure of whom to blame.

The call for Democrats to take a harder line against Trump has been building for months. Across the country, progressive activists, disaffected Republicans and voters outraged by the administration’s actions have packed town halls, marched in protests and launched campaigns of their own – sending a clear message to Democrats: step up, or step aside.

“Everybody wants a fighter,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice-president at the centrist thinktank Third Way that is often at odds with the party’s left flank.

Erickson said the focus on healthcare – an issue that unifies the party’s diverse coalition and falls squarely in the “Venn diagram of things voters care about” – was both good politics and good policy.

“The ACA subsidies are a real ask,” she said. “If Democrats got that, it would be a way to declare victory in this moment.”

Democrats feel confident going to battle over healthcare. A Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll showed that 78% of Americans support extending the credits, which disproportionately benefit Republican-held congressional districts.

Without action, insurance premiums for millions of Americans could double next year, according to an analysis by KFF. Democrats have also sought to reverse Medicaid cuts included in Trump’s marquee tax-and-immigration package, which the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects will leave 10 million more Americans uninsured over the next decade.

Republicans have countered by falsely claiming Democrats forced a shutdown to provide free health benefits to undocumented immigrants. The White House has taunted Democrats with a deepfake video of Schumer and Jeffries, wearing a sombrero and fake mustache that has been widely denounced as racist. Vance laughed off the criticism, calling the video “funny”.

Democrats like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, fired back with memes and taunts of their own. In one tweet, Newsom’s press team posted an AI generated image of Trump in a towering wig and an 18th-century gown: TRUMP “MARIE ANTOINETTE” SAYS, “NO HEALTH CARE FOR YOU PEASANTS, BUT A BALLROOM FOR THE QUEEN!”

Democrats are betting that the shutdown strategy can help shift momentum heading into next year’s midterm elections. By wielding their most powerful legislative tool, party leaders aim to rebuild trust with their disillusioned base – a group whose frustration has dragged Democratic approval ratings to decade lows and hurt fundraising.

Many Democrats argue that their best hope of restraining Trump is to regain the House in 2026, and that the most straightforward path to doing so is to focus on kitchen-table issues like healthcare.

Some Democratic strategists warn that by focusing primarily on healthcare, the party risks downplaying what many view as Trump’s authoritarian lurch – reducing it to just another policy showdown in Washington’s partisan budget battles.

Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic strategist and communications researcher, believes a sharper message – such as “we will not fund fascism” or “no dollars for dictatorship” – would help cut through the noise and clarify the stakes.

“In order for people to fight this regime, they have to understand it as a regime hellbent on taking our freedoms,” she said.

As part of their demands, Democrats are also pushing for ways to curtail Trump’s ability to rescind funding already approved by Congress, as he has done with foreign aid programs and public broadcasting. An alternative short-term funding bill offered by Democrats included provisions that would make it harder for the president to undermine Congress’s funding power.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible and a leading voice on the left pushing Democrats to fight harder against what he calls the Trump “regime”, said he was encouraged to see the party’s leadership sharpen its tactics. Though Levin shares the view that the stakes are far bigger than a healthcare policy dispute, he believes Democrats’ demands, if met, could “constrain the regime in some meaningful ways”.

Indivisible is helping to coordinate a second wave of No Kings rallies across the country to protest what organizers described as Trump’s “authoritarian power grab”. The day of action, planned for 18 October, will be another opportunity to mobilize Americans and, Levin hopes, to celebrate Democrats for their resolve.

“I hope what we will not be doing is criticizing them for having surrendered again,” he said. “So the play is to win.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a0a19273693e8b73b5c00423004d7f34a026dd/81_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96af3544967124b8c341f2dffa705562",N,,2025-10-05 13:57:01.925731

This is a white supremist organization that’s seeking to terrorize Black and Brown people in the city of Chicago.”","(NewsNation) — A Chicago alderperson who was handcuffed by federal immigration authorities while inquiring about a man who was injured during a foot chase with agents says the experience demonstrates how the Trump administration is sowing fear and chaos across the city.

Ald. Jessie Fuentes said she was asking feds at the hospital Friday if they had a signed warrant for the undocumented individual they were after. Agents spun her around and handcuffed her, according to video posted to the Citizen App. She was quickly released, Fuentes said, but was warned not to try to re-enter the hospital.

“In the hospital, there are patients, there are staff that did not feel safe, and they called me to find out why ICE was in the hospital,” said Fuentes, referring to officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “Now, as the alderperson of the 26th Ward, I have a moral obligation to protect the residents that live in my ward.”

Fuentes said her brush with ICE is just one example of how the feds under the Trump administration are riding roughshod over people since the Department of Homeland Security sent a surge of resources to Chicago to enforce immigration laws. She argues relatively few migrants caught up in the dragnet have criminal records, and even U.S. citizens are being swept up because of their appearance.

“There are U.S. citizens who are contractors, laborers, in the city of Chicago that are being detained because they’re Brown and they speak Spanish,” Fuentes told “NewsNation Prime” on Saturday. “This is not about making our community safe. This is a white supremist organization that’s seeking to terrorize Black and Brown people in the city of Chicago.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/citizen.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-05 15:57:56.898648

Pritzker said this past week, ""ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White.

After passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.
I asked Acton, ""Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?""","It's 11:00 a.m. on a Sunday in the heart of Hollywood, and the service at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is just getting underway. It was worship via the web. The church itself was empty, just like during the pandemic, when parishioners feared catching COVID. Today it was empty because they fear being caught themselves.

On June 6, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement descended on Ambiance Apparel, a clothing wholesaler in L.A.'s Fashion District. The pastor of St. Stephen's, Father Jaime Edwards Acton, whose congregation is about 80% Hispanic, got a frantic call: ""She said, 'They got 'em.' At first, I had no idea what she was talking about because I was not thinking about it,"" Acton said. ""Even with all the threats and the bravado and stuff, I was not thinking that it would happen directly to us.""

Thirteen members of his congregation were arrested that day. The Trump Administration no longer considers schools, hospitals and churches to be ""protected sensitive locations"" anymore. So, the following Sunday, Acton told his faithful to stay away.

He says the decision to close the church was not made lightly: ""No, not at all, but I was trying to balance, could we do church in person knowing that a good portion of our community was too afraid to leave their homes? It wasn't even people that were undocumented. I have longtime parishioners that I know for sure are citizens and have been for a while that were afraid to leave. They were afraid to leave their homes.""

In Los Angeles, that fear turned to anger, and anger into violence. The raids were challenged in court for being indiscriminate and based on skin color, but ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the raids could continue.

Since then, in city after city, the administration has been testing the court's limits, especially in Chicago. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said this past week, ""ICE is running around the Loop harassing people for not being White. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States. Now ICE is making it commonplace.""

Pritzker said Saturday the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. Pritzker said Mr. Trump gave him an ultimatum: ""Call up your troops, or we will.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has long defended the ICE raids as only going after the ""worst of the worst.""

""Nobody is getting swept up,"" Noem said on August 8. ""We're running targeted enforcement operations across the country.""

But as those operations increased, so have assaults on federal agents: a sniper attack on an ICE facility in Dallas; an ambush in Alvarado, Texas; a violent scuffle in San Francisco.

And then there is Portland. Protests around the ICE headquarters there have sparked particular ire from President Donald Trump, who directed federal troops to be sent to what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called a ""war-ravaged city."" [On Saturday a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Portland.]

In fact, this past week, while addressing top military brass, the president suggested American cities could serve as ""training grounds"" for U.S. combat troops. ""It seems that the ones that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And we're gonna straighten 'em out one by one. And this is gonna be a major part for some of the people in this room.""

""This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore""

That idea has some military commanders uneasy, and even civilians within ICE itself are finding themselves conflicted.

As part of ICE's legal department, attorney Adam Boyd provided guidance related to how ICE officers performed their enforcement duties. ""I saw this push to find how can we accomplish the goal with anything that seems legal enough,"" he said. ""We're lumping people with no criminal history who have been here for a very long time with the 'worst of the worst.'

""There's no question we have threats in our country,"" Boyd said. ""That's why the State Department and Homeland Security and the FBI and all these agencies work together to keep people safe. This doesn't feel like protecting the homeland anymore. It feels like we're just hitting numbers and goals.""

Take the case of 20-year-old Dylan Contreras, who came into the U.S. from Venezuela under a Biden-era mobile app. Back in April, though, DHS began revoking the legal status of many of those who used that app to apply for asylum.

While his case was pending, Contreras had been attending high school in the Bronx learning English, and working as a delivery driver, in order to get his mom, Raiza, and his two younger siblings – Helen, 10 and Caleb, 7 – out of a shelter.

Last May, Contreras did what he was required to: he showed up for his court hearing in New York. His mother said they assumed it was just another routine hearing in the process. ""Yes, I didn't think anything bad would happen,"" she said through an interpreter. ""He wanted to enter legally; he didn't want to get into trouble. He did it the right way.""

As they left the courtroom, however, his mother says federal agents followed them into the elevator. ""Like, five people or something came at me and grabbed me, pushed me to the floor,"" she said. ""My son screamed, and they grabbed him, too, and put handcuffs on him.""

Contreras did not have a criminal record. ""Not at all, not at all,"" his mother said. ""Those who know him, know.""

His case for asylum was denied last month. Pending an appeal, Contreras will be deported, leaving his mother and his two young siblings behind. Raiza said she was ""Devastated, devastated, because I've always been with my children, and he's been my partner. He's always been more than a son, a friend, everything.""

The most recent ICE data shows those with no criminal record, like Contreras, now make up the bulk of those being arrested and detained.

The Department of Homeland Security, however, is quick to list the violent offenders who have been captured, and there are many.

As for Adam Boyd? Back in May he resigned his position at ICE citing ""unforeseen circumstances.""

""It was a difficult decision,"" he said. ""If you think something is wrong, then you have to recognize that.""

He's now working for a firm in Philadelphia defending those arrested by ICE, which is no small task. After passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Fr. Jaimie Edwards Acton says the expansion of ICE should be seen as a warning: ""I would tell everybody who thinks that this would never happen to them, that it could happen to them,"" he said. ""And people need to be ready for it, and to think through the possible, you know, kind of responses to it.""

For Acton, that response is no more hiding. For any immigrant, legal or otherwise, this is the new reality.

So, for those willing to come back, the St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is open again, with eyes out for ICE, while they pray for peace and understanding.

I asked Acton, ""Does it feel a little like David versus Goliath, though?""

""Yeah,"" said Acton, ""but, you know, David won that one!""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/04/e7da5ee7-85c8-4302-a1b2-728f70d17f14/thumbnail/1200x630/895dbf664fec70ae6389f37be0e51593/ice-agents-1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:57:17.883086

White Sands National Park Because of the shutdown, New Mexico’s White Sands National Park will be closed “until further notice,” according to the park’s website.
Under the National Park Service contingency plan, open-air memorials and monuments like the National Mall also generally will remain accessible to the public.","Mr. Pritzker singled out a late-night Border Patrol raid last week at an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side, when video taken by bystanders showed residents of the building restrained with zip ties.

Federal agents were “just picking up people who are brown and Black and then checking their credentials,” Mr. Pritzker said. He added: “They are the ones that are making it a war zone. They need to get out of Chicago if they’re not going to focus on the worst of the worst, which is what the president said they were going to do.”

Mr. Pritzker suggested that the Trump administration, which planned to send 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, is intentionally heightening tensions. The administration wants to “create the war zone so they can send in even more troops,” he said.

Mr. Pritzker said he had directed state agencies to investigate what happened at the apartment building, citing reports of “children who were zip tied and held, some of them nearly naked” and “elderly people being thrown into a U-Haul for three hours and detained.” Mr. Pritzker added he believed that some of the people were U.S. citizens.

“What kind of a country are we living in?” he said.

The governor also said he wanted to know more about an episode in Chicago on Saturday when a federal agent shot and wounded a motorist who, according to federal officials, had rammed and boxed-in a law enforcement vehicle.

“It’s really hard to know exactly what the facts are, and they won’t let us access the facts,” he said. “They are just putting out their propaganda. And then we’ve got to later determine what actually happened.”

Asked whether the two-year-old war was over, Mr. Rubio responded: “Well not yet. There’s some work remains to be done.” He went on to say that Hamas had “agreed to the president’s hostage release framework.”

Mr. Rubio spoke a day before a new round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, conducted through mediators, was expected to begin in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. Ron Dermer, a close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, will lead Israel’s delegation. Hamas officials did not respond to requests for comment on who would attend from their side.

The Cairo talks are expected to focus on swapping the remaining hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners — one component in the sweeping proposal released by Mr. Trump last week. Mr. Rubio suggested that this focus would leave negotiations on other formidable obstacles to ending the war until a later stage.

Israel believes that about 20 living hostages still remain in Gaza, as well as the bodies of at least 25 others. It is unclear whether Hamas would free the hostages before concluding the rest of an agreement to end the war as it views the captives as the most significant leverage it has with Israel.

Mr. Trump’s proposal demands that Hamas return all of the surviving captives and the bodies in its possession within 72 hours of Israel agreeing to the cease-fire.

“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST,” Mr. Trump said in a post on social media on Saturday.

The president’s plan envisions the creation of a Palestinian government supervised by an international “Board of Peace” led by Mr. Trump as chairman and a postwar security force drawn from foreign countries, as well as the disarming of Hamas.

Under the plan, the hostages will be swapped for 250 Palestinians serving life sentences in prison and 1,700 Gazans jailed by Israel during the war. Israel will also hand over the bodies of 15 Gazans for each dead Israeli.

Mr. Netanyahu has said he supports the proposal. Hamas officials have expressed significant reservations about some of the terms, in particular about surrendering their weapons. But even the first step of exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli pullback within Gaza will likely present difficulties, analysts say.

Both Israeli and Hamas officials say that the Palestinian group might need more time. Some living captives are believed to be held deep underground, while the bodies of others will need to be located and dug up.

Another potential sticking point to a deal will be how far Israeli forces commit to withdrawing from their current positions within Gaza.

In previous talks, Hamas had agreed for Israeli troops to withdraw to a buffer zone close to the enclave’s borders. But the lines proposed by Mr. Trump would leave Israeli forces deployed far deeper in Gaza, which Hamas could object to.

Israel and Hamas will likely disagree over the list of names of Palestinian prisoners to be released, who include many jailed for attacks on Israeli civilians. In the past, Hamas officials have indicated they would demand the release of senior Palestinian leaders jailed by Israel such as Marwan Barghouti — which Israel would likely oppose.

Israel and Hamas have now fought for two years since Hamas led the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war and killed about 1,200 people. The Israeli campaign has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza — including thousands of children — according to local health officials.

The war has devastated the Gaza Strip, whose two million Palestinian residents have lived through constant fear, widespread hunger and bombardment. Human rights groups and a U.N. commission have accused Israel of genocide; the Israeli government says it is fighting Hamas, not Palestinian civilians.

The warring sides agreed to two short-lived cease-fires that saw more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages freed in exchange for more than 1,500 Palestinian prisoners. Israel ended the last truce in mid-March, citing a deadlock in talks on a comprehensive cease-fire.

Israel and Hamas do not speak directly, instead relying on Qatari and Egyptian mediators to act as go-betweens, ferrying messages back and forth.

“As a general rule, if a facility or area is locked or secured during nonbusiness hours (buildings, gated parking lots, etc.) it should be locked or secured for the duration of the shutdown,” a contingency plan posted online by the Interior Department states.

Roughly two-thirds of the employees at the National Park Service, which is already facing a steep staffing shortage, have been furloughed during the shutdown, according to the plan. How much the remaining crew members will be able to do involving essential functions like law enforcement, emergency services and wildfire monitoring is unclear.

While not a comprehensive list, here is a rundown among prominent destinations of what is open, what is not and what is limited while the shutdown persists.

California National Parks

California’s nine national parks, the most of any state in the country, broadly remain open to visitors, according to the parks’ websites. But services will be limited, and some facilities, including Black Rock Nature Center in Joshua Tree National Park, will be closed.

Elsewhere in the state, local media reported that Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, home to the infamous former federal prison of the same name, reopened last week after briefly closing at the start of the shutdown. And Muir Woods, a national monument near San Francisco famed for its redwood trees, will be closed, according to its website.

Utah National Parks

According to the Utah Office of Tourism website, the state’s five national parks — Zion, Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Bryce Canyon — will remain open during the shutdown, with visitor centers at each park either open now or slated to open this weekend.

Colorado National Parks

The eight National Park Service sites in Colorado that collect fees — including Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde and Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Parks — will continue to operate using fee revenues until that funding runs out, the state’s governor, Jared Polis, said in a statement. State agencies are working with National Park Service leaders to keep those parks open, and county sheriffs in the state have also offered to support law enforcement at national park sites during the shutdown, Mr. Polis’s office said.

Underground attractions

The caves in Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico will be closed for the duration of the shutdown, as will all roads into the park, according to a post on the park’s Facebook page. Under the Interior Department contingency plan, guided tours of other cave systems, including those in Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, likely will be limited or suspended.

Grand Canyon National Park

Arizona’s most famous National Park will remain open to the public during the shutdown, but it will not collect entrance fees, according to the Grand Canyon Conservancy. Buildings on the site that are operated by the National Park Service, such as visitor centers, will be closed, the group said.

Elsewhere in the state, Petrified Forest National Park, which typically closes overnight, will likely be inaccessible for the duration of the shutdown under the Interior Department’s contingency plan.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park

The country’s most visited National Park will remain open, according to a news release from Sevier County, Tenn., which encompasses a section of the park. Under a joint plan formed by several state and local agencies and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, areas that closed at the start of the shutdown will reopen. Staff members will be on duty to clean restrooms, as well as protect visitors and wildlife, according to the statement.

Acadia National Park

In a news release on Wednesday, Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that Acadia National Park would remain “mostly open” during the shutdown, with essential visitor services intact. Local media reported on Thursday that the road to Cadillac Mountain, the park’s highest peak, which offers sweeping views of the Maine coastline, had reopened after briefly closing at the start of the shutdown.

White Sands National Park

Because of the shutdown, New Mexico’s White Sands National Park will be closed “until further notice,” according to the park’s website.

Washington, D.C., Museums and Attractions

Most museums and monuments in D.C. remain open, but more could begin to close if the shutdown continues, according to Destination DC, a nonprofit that promotes tourism in the nation’s capital. Sites that have already closed include the Library of Congress, the National Archives Museum, the Washington Monument and the National Arboretum, according to the site. Tours of the Capitol Building and the Pentagon are also suspended.

Sites run by the Smithsonian Institution — including galleries and museums across D.C. and the National Zoo — will remain open through Oct. 11, the institution said in a statement. Under the National Park Service contingency plan, open-air memorials and monuments like the National Mall also generally will remain accessible to the public.

Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia

Several landmarks in Philadelphia’s Independence National Historical Park — including the Liberty Bell Center, Independence Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Museum — are closed, according to Visit Philadelphia.

Gateway Arch in St. Louis

The tram to reach the observation deck of the Arch will be suspended during the shutdown, and all ticketed events at the site have been canceled until further notice, according to the park’s website.

In her ruling, Judge Immergut wrote that she expected a trial court to agree with the state’s contention that the president exceeded his constitutional authority in mobilizing federal troops for local work and likely violated the 10th Amendment.

The soldiers have been training on the Oregon coast and were expected to be in place by the weekend, though federal officials have not said what duties they would perform beyond assisting ICE.

The restraining order expires in two weeks. During that time, the judge is expected to rule on a request for a longer injunction against the deployment. Federal lawyers have appealed the restraining order, which is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Oregon and Portland that accuses the president of violating his constitutional authority.

“President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman said. “We expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

The decision comes as the president pushes to deploy the National Guard in several major U.S. cities to combat crime and support immigration enforcement. On Saturday, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said that Mr. Trump planned to send 300 Guard troops to Chicago soon.

Before the judge’s ruling, Oregon National Guard troops were not the only Guard troops who were on the cusp of deploying in the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said he was told by the federal government that, against his wishes, California National Guard troops who had been deployed in Los Angeles under federal orders were going to be sent to Oregon to help train troops there, according to a state official close to the governor who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation.

During almost two hours of arguments Friday, lawyers for Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, contended that the president did not have the authority to use the National Guard at the ICE facility and warned that the arrival of federal forces would lead to greater violence.

State and city attorneys described Mr. Trump’s selection of Portland for deployment as “at best, arbitrary, and at worst, a politically motivated retaliation for the adoption of policies” that the president viewed as too liberal.

The president’s actions “represent one of the most dramatic infringements on state sovereignty in Oregon’s history,” Scott Kennedy, an attorney for Oregon said in court. “They radically reshape the balance of federal-state power,”

State lawyers also questioned the timing of Mr. Trump’s decision, noting records from the Portland Police Bureau that showed the size of the nightly demonstrations had dwindled before the president posted on his social media website last Saturday that he planned to ask the Department of Defense to use federal troops to “protect” Portland.

Portland Police commanders checked in with ICE officials every evening, according to records they filed in support of the temporary restraining order, and for several weeks prior to the president’s declaration, ICE employees reported that things were relatively quiet and that they did not need help.

Judge Immergut, who was appointed by Mr. Trump during his first term, agreed that the timing of the president’s order did not meet the legal standard for calling in the National Guard, saying the state provided “substantial evidence that the protests at the Portland ICE facility were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the President’s directive.”

Mr. Kennedy also said the situation in Portland did not meet the standard required for mobilization of federal soldiers for domestic work; the law allows federal troops to be used domestically in times of foreign invasion, rebellion or when normal law enforcement efforts are not capable of maintaining order.

Federal lawyers contended that the protests in Portland constituted both a potential rebellion and a law enforcement challenge beyond what federal officers on the ground could handle. But Mr. Kennedy said the federal government was defining “rebellion” so broadly it could include any political demonstrations or “opposition to its authority.”

Judge Immergut agreed, writing that the federal government had shown evidence of “sporadic violence” but not “any evidence demonstrating that those episodes of violence were part of an organized attempt to overthrow the government as a whole.”

Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department lawyer, told the judge the decision to use National Guard soldiers was prompted by the Sept. 24 shooting that killed two detainees at a Dallas ICE facility and months of demonstrations in Portland that have left federal employees frightened and exhausted.

“Violent and cruel radicals have laid siege,” he said. “The evidence we have submitted at least reflects a danger of a rebellion, monthslong targeting of the Portland ICE building with violence, intimidation and threats.”

In the order released Saturday evening, Judge Immergut wrote that the president’s argument about the need for mobilization was contradicted by evidence that recent protests had been comparatively quiet and nonviolent, supporting the state’s case that the decision to use troops “was not ‘conceived in good faith.’”

The nightly demonstrations at Portland’s ICE building began in early summer and have included occasional skirmishes between protesters and federal agents as demonstrators tried to block vehicles from entering and exiting a parking garage. Multiple times a day, ICE agents in riot gear march out of the building to clear the driveway. During daylight hours, the crowd disperses quickly. At times federal officers have used pepper balls, tear gas and other crowd dispersal weapons to move people back.The Portland Police Bureau reported 27 arrests since early June outside the building, and court records show at least two dozen arrests by federal officers.

The protests have turned rougher since the president’s announcement last weekend with the arrival of right wing counterprotesters, some of whom have been spotted observing the crowd from the ICE building roof. A march to protest the potential deployment Saturday afternoon ended with federal officers using tear gas and pepper balls against a crowd that had gathered in the road in front of the building.

Judge Immergut, a former U.S. attorney in Oregon, is the second federal judge assigned to Oregon’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump. The first recused after a request from the federal lawyers because his wife, Representative Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, had spoken out against the National Guard deployment.

JB Pritzker’s objections, the governor announced Saturday.

“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a statement. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

The promised deployment comes as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, activity has ramped up in Chicago and its suburbs as part of “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has so far resulted in more than 800 arrests according to the Department of Homeland Security.

There have also been two shootings, including one Saturday on the city’s Southwest Side.

Though the Trump administration insists ICE is targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds, reports have mounted of agents arresting those with no history of illegal activity, detaining children along with their parents and even handcuffing U.S. citizens. Immigrant and civil rights groups have alleged ICE is arresting people without warrants in violation of a federal consent decree.

The wave of raids and arrests has spurred large protests in recent weeks, especially outside of an ICE processing center in Broadview, a suburb eight miles west of Chicago. The demonstrations have spurred clashes between immigration agents and activists, leading to the arrests of several protestors last weekend on charges of resisting and assaulting officers. Agents have sprayed chemical agents and fired nonlethal rounds into the crowds outside the facility.

On Monday, Pritzker announced DHS was seeking 100 Illinois National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities and immigration agents in Illinois, warning the Trump administration would use any confrontation resulting from its Chicago-area immigration crackdown as a “pretext” for a military deployment.

On Saturday, the governor called the administration’s National Guard activation a ”manufactured performance” and not about protecting public safety.

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,“ Pritzker said, pointing to the Illinois State Police’s announcement this week that it had joined forces with Broadview Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to form a “Unified Command” to coordinate law enforcement activity outside the ICE facility.

One of ISP’s first acts in Broadview was designating demonstration areas, also known as “free speech zones.” Pritzker on Saturday said the combined efforts of state and local law enforcement protected “people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.”

The Unified Command reported the arrests of at least five protesters on Friday, but none on Saturday. The area was quiet Saturday afternoon with only about a dozen protesters gathered, at times outnumbered by members of the media.

“I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people,” the governor said in his statement.

But shortly before Pritzker’s announcement about the National Guard deployment Saturday, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot a woman in an altercation between immigration agents and protesters on Chicago’s Southwest Side.

According to reporting from the Chicago Sun-Times, the woman was alleged to have been driving one of 10 cars that “rammed” and “boxed in” nearly three dozen immigration agents in the city’s Brighton Park neighborhood. Agents fired “defensive shots” when they saw the woman was allegedly “armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” according to the paper. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Trump and Pritzker have spent weeks trading barbs over the president’s threats to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, with the governor alleging Trump’s apparent backing off from the idea last month was a sign of dementia.

The governor has already vowed legal action against the Trump administration if and when the president activated the National Guard. After the president sent 1,400 National Guard troops to Los Angeles this summer — the first time since the 1960s that the feds deployed the National Guard without a governor’s consent — a federal judge last month ruled the move violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters. But the ruling only applies to California.

The National Guard’s presence in Los Angeles has dwindled to roughly 250, but there are still a couple thousand troops on assignment in Washington, D.C., where the federal government has more power over law enforcement. Since their August deployment to the nation’s capital, guardsmen have been reportedly picking up garbage, as they are only authorized to assist with arrests if asked by local law enforcement.

Trump has also threatened to federalize the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, though troops have not yet been sent. Tennessee’s Republican governor has welcomed the president’s recent suggestion that he’d deploy guardsmen to Memphis, but that has also yet to happen.

Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington, D.C. and Shelby County, Tennessee, where Memphis is situated, have all adopted so-called “sanctuary city” policies wherein local law enforcement are barred from assisting in federal immigration enforcement. Trump has targeted cities and states that have adopted such laws, and last week a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled the administration cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.

But this week, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he learned of another attempt by the White House to divert disaster relief funding from Illinois with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.”

Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois again on Friday. Noem has traveled to the Chicago area and Springfield several times this year, including last month when she oversaw an early morning raid in Elgin, where at least one U.S. citizen was arrested.

“Secretary Noem should no longer be able to step foot inside the State of Illinois without any form of public accountability,” Pritzker said in a statement.

On Friday, Noem appeared with Gregory Bovino, commander-at-large of the U.S. Border Patrol, at the Broadview ICE facility with a camera crew, according to Chicago’s ABC 7.

Late Friday, Pritzker also said he’s making state resources available to people affected by a Sept. 30 raid on a South Shore apartment building.

In Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood, masked federal agents deployed a chemical irritant outside of a grocery store as people and cars lined up to block their advancement, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

State Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, condemned the action, which happened around the corner from an elementary school in her district. Chicago Ald.

Of those 33 missing prisoners, least a dozen are over 60, and several, like Mr. Hurtado, have diabetes and high blood pressure.

That’s the last anyone saw of him.

Mr. Hurtado, 57, a computer systems engineer and a longtime political activist, is one of nearly three dozen people who human rights groups say have been disappeared by Nicaraguan authorities — taken away with officials refusing to acknowledge their detention or disclose their whereabouts.

Such disappearances are a violation of international law and are especially resonant in Latin America, where the practice has been a hallmark of brutal dictatorships. In Nicaragua, they have been happening within the past two years, the majority of them more recently.

Nearly half of the 73 political prisoners that human rights groups have officially documented in Nicaragua appear in no public court database. They have had no contact with their families, and the crimes they were charged with are unknown. Families have gone from prison to prison, police station to police station, seeking their loved ones, without success, human rights groups say.

The authorities summoned relatives to a coroner’s office and escorted them to a cemetery to bury Mr. Petri without the opportunity for an autopsy, human rights groups said.

Four days later, the body of Carlos Cárdenas Cepeda, a lawyer for the Catholic church, which has also been targeted by the government, was given back to his family. He had been detained for 15 days. No cause of death was given in either case, and the government has made no public pronouncements about them.

These deaths have alarmed the families of the others detained about whom the authorities have revealed nothing. Of those 33 missing prisoners, least a dozen are over 60, and several, like Mr. Hurtado, have diabetes and high blood pressure. One of the missing detainees is 81.

The police officers who showed up without warrants to arrest Mr. Hurtado and search his home in Managua suggested five police stations where the family might later find him, said Mr. Hurtado’s brother Adolfo.

Mr. Hurtado’s wife and his two brothers spent weeks visiting police stations and prisons, where they said they faced bureaucratic runarounds and hourslong waits.

“At first, two brothers and she went once a week, so three times a week, for more or less a month and a half,” Adolfo Hurtado said, referring to José Alejandro Hurtado’s wife. “That rhythm was unsustainable for the family.”

Adolfo Hurtado said he believes his brother was targeted because he had publicly released a proposal for national dialogue and elections to address the country’s political crisis.

Nicaragua’s co-presidents, but particularly Ms. Murillo, seem fixated on clearing the political landscape of any independent voices who could threaten her ability to govern if Mr. Ortega, who will turn 80 next month, dies.

Ms. Murillo, 74, who also acts as a government spokeswoman, did not respond to requests for comment.

Forced disappearances have a long and painful history in Latin America. The term “desaparecido” became synonymous with political repression between 1976 and 1983 in Argentina, when a military dictatorship abducted as many as 30,000 accused dissidents, tortured them and, in hundreds of cases, threw them from airplanes into the sea.

And throughout Latin America hundreds of thousands of people who have disappeared since the 1970s were taken to secret detention centers, tortured and executed. Many of their bodies were never found.

While hundreds of people eventually faced trial in Argentina, many cases of the disappeared went unpunished, said María Adela Antokoletz, who heads the Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.

“We realize that the abhorrent practice of enforced disappearance continues as a means to silence complaints,” she said.

Mexico, El Salvador and Colombia are three countries in the region where the practice still occurs, though more often perpetrated by gangs or cartels with the acquiescence of local police or mayors, Ms. Antokoletz said.

Authorities are obligated under international law to inform family members if they are holding someone, said Barbara Frey, a retired University of Minnesota professor who coedited a book about disappearances in contemporary Latin America.

“If the state has taken them and won’t tell the families where they are, that’s a disappearance,” Ms. Frey said. “That’s exactly what the definition says.”

The term historically applied to people missing for prolonged stretches of time, said Reed Brody, a member of the United Nations Group of Human Rights Experts on Nicaragua. But international authorities have increasingly recognized that it also applies even to short-term secret detentions, like those in Nicaragua, he said.

Mr. Brody said the 33 documented cases in Nicaragua were believed to be an undercount because many families are too afraid to file a complaint with human rights organizations. The families have reported being harassed and threatened with arrest or having their property confiscated if they persist in trying to track down their loved ones, human rights experts said.

The missing include community leaders, teachers, Indigenous leaders, journalists and pastors. In at least five cases, multiple people in the same family were arrested. Many were detained over the summer, when more than 50 people were arrested in simultaneous roundups.

“It’s hard to know why some people are arrested and some people are disappeared,” Mr. Brody said.

Angelica Chavarríahas was last seen in May 2024, the same day her partner, Daniel Ortega’s brother Humberto, was placed under house arrest, according to human rights organizations.

He died last year.

Thelma Brenes says she has a theory behind the disappearances. Her father, Carlos Brenes Sánchez, 70, and his partner, Salvadora Martínez, 67, Ms. Brenes said, were taken on Aug. 14 from their home in Jinotepe, about 90 miles north of Managua, Ms. Brenes said.

“If they are disappearing people who they are not registering in jail, how can you prove that there are political prisoners in Nicaragua?” she said. “There are no pictures. He’s not in the system. Can we prove it?”

Mr. Brenes is a retired military colonel and a longtime opponent of Mr. Ortega. He was arrested in 2018 when he spoke out against government abuses after mass street protests but was released a year later under an amnesty law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/23/multimedia/00int-nicaragua-disappeared-jbkg/00int-nicaragua-disappeared-jbkg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 12:57:13.136435

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said, in part. He said the administration intends to federalize hundreds of National Guard troops ""in the coming hours.""

President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.""

The announcement came after a federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Portland for at least 14 days. Oregon's governor, said in a statement, ""justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed.""

The concern over a deployment of Illinois National Guard members prompted an emergency motion filed by Broadview leaders Saturday. The village is seeking the removal of the fence erected by federal authorities around the ICE facility amid ongoing demonstrations.

The village has called the fence illegal and a safety hazard, asking for a judge to grant the motion pending a Tuesday hearing on the village's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security.

DHS responded to that motion in its own court filing, saying there's no need for a hearing before Tuesday, bringing up the possibility of a settlement on Monday.

Amid the announcement of the federalization of the National Guard in Illinois, confrontations seemed to arise again Saturday in Broadview between demonstrators and Illinois State Police throughout the day.

""It's a continuing overreach by the president because the governor is responsible for calling up the troops when they think it's necessary,"" demonstrator Tony DiBenedetto said.

A crowd of anti-ICE demonstrators cheered on at least four people ABC7 saw detained by Illinois State Police as they were walked into a Cook County Sheriff's Office van in handcuffs. They were taken down as troopers were clearing the street outside the ICE detention center in Broadview, backing protesters into designated zones, feet from the immigration building and surrounded by concrete barriers. Federal agents were on the other side of the fence with their flying drone above it all.

""I'm not here to deal with the State Police. I'm here to deal with the kidnapping that ICE is doing, and it's immensely disappointing that State Police are putting themselves between us and ICE,"" demonstrator Will Creutz said.

Tensions continued throughout the night Saturday between Illinois State Police and demonstrators.

Federal agents and protesters also clashed at the west suburban Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Friday morning.

The Cook County Sheriff's Office said at least five people were arrested during those clashes. They are facing charges such as resisting, obstruction and aggravated battery to a police officer.

That clash came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino were seen on the ICE facility's roof just before 8 a.m. They were accompanied by several armed agents, cameras and a production crew.

President Donald Trump has previously threatened to send the National Guard to Chicago to combat crime, and even said earlier this week that the city could become a training ground for the military.

On Monday, Pritzker said he learned that DHS is requesting that 100 military personnel be sent to Illinois to protect ICE agents.

Full Saturday statement from Pritzker:

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will. It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.

In the coming hours, the Trump Administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard. They will pull hardworking Americans out of their regular jobs and away from their families all to participate in a manufactured performance -- not a serious effort the protect public safety. For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control.

This demand follows unprecedented escalations of aggression against Illinois citizens and residents. Yesterday, Kristi Noem's and Greg Bovino's masked agents threw chemical agents near an elementary school, arrested elected officials exercising their First Amendment rights, and raided a Wal-Mart. None of it was in pursuit of justice, but all of it was in pursuit of social media videos.

I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois. State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people's ability to peacefully exercise their connotational rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump's acts of aggression against our people.

In Illinois, we will do everything within our power to look out for our neighbors, uphold the Constitution, and defend the rule of law.""

Statement from Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton:

""Donald Trump intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and deploy them to Chicago without the consent of Governor Pritzker or our administration. These are Illinoisans who will be ripped away from their families to serve in Trump's political stunt. We have warned that this has been their plan all along, and now it's here.

Our city is not a sandbox for Donald Trump to play dictator. It's intentional cruelty that will devastate families and scar our communities.

Let me be clear: the only emergency in Chicago is the chaos that Donald Trump and his administration are deliberately fueling in our streets. Journalists targeted and shot at, peaceful residents dragged from their homes, women and children zip-tied in the streets, families torn apart and stuffed into U-Hauls. This is unacceptable, reprehensible, and not what we stand for in Illinois.

""I have spent my career working to make communities safer and lead on public safety for our administration. Not a single violence-prevention expert I have worked with has ever said the answer is to flood our neighborhoods with federal troops.

From an initial showing of two Broadview officers and three state troopers around 7 a.m., the local police presence grew by 10 a.m. to several dozen state troopers, sheriff’s police and officers from neighboring municipalities.
Ryan Glew confirmed that no Evanston officers were deployed to Broadview on Friday, the first time NIPAS has appeared at the ICE facility protests.
“If ICE agents want to terrorize protesters, police should not be blocking off roads to make it easier for ICE to do that,” Amiwala said.
“State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights.","Dozens of state and local police officers aided federal officers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a protest near the agency’s Broadview holding facility Friday by helping escort federal vehicles and maintaining a large perimeter line, which at times included officers from a “police mutual aid” unit that the Evanston Police Department is a member of.

Protests have grown over the last several weeks at the west suburban facility, where ICE detainees have reported “dehumanizing” conditions while awaiting transfer to different locations. Recent demonstrations have included repeat appearances from Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss and fellow congressional candidates Kat Abughazaleh and Bushra Amiwala. After continuously using tear gas and pepperballs against protesters directly in front of the facility, ICE pushed protests back by erecting an unauthorized fence around the building, which the Village of Broadview has demanded be removed.

The situation changed again Thursday evening, when the Illinois State Police announced that a “temporary Unified Command” has been established to “coordinate public safety measures” around the facility. A news release listed ISP and the Broadview Police Department as partnering with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office, the county’s Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.

The release included a map of Beach Street, where the ICE building is located, which labeled the middle of the street as a “restricted area” and the sides and sidewalks as “protest areas.” These areas were separated on the ground by concrete barriers placed by the Illinois Department of Transportation.

“The Unified Command is setting up designated areas where people can safely exercise their rights, which will support the safety of the public, and ensure vehicular traffic can safely access the roads in the area,” ISP said in its statement. “The goal of the Unified Command is to protect the health and safety of all individuals, including nearby Broadview residents and businesses, and enable the peaceful expression of First Amendment rights.”

Intersection and traffic control

That area received little attention Friday morning, however, as both protesters and police concentrated farther south at the intersection of Harvard Street and 25th Avenue, which ICE vehicles used to enter and exit the facility.

From an initial showing of two Broadview officers and three state troopers around 7 a.m., the local police presence grew by 10 a.m. to several dozen state troopers, sheriff’s police and officers from neighboring municipalities. These officers maintained a perimeter covering the entire intersection and restricted traffic along 25th Avenue, ensuring federal vehicles could move freely.

Throughout the day, numerous protesters were detained by both federal and non-federal officers. Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol commander-at-large, was present when federal agents charged into the crowd without provocation and detained several people, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem was spotted on the Broadview facility’s roof in the morning as well.

Shortly before 11:15 a.m., a group of suburban police officers were deployed to the scene through the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS), specifically from its Mobile Field Force (MFF) designed to respond to “civil disturbances, union conflicts, public demonstrations” and other protest events, per its website. NIPAS is a suburban “police mutual aid” organization, meaning suburban members provide resources and personnel for deployment in incidents that exceed one member’s capacity.

EPD is a founding member of NIPAS, and as of June 2024 contributes seven officers to the MFF and six to the Emergency Services Team, which acts as a SWAT team. EPD Cmdr. Ryan Glew confirmed that no Evanston officers were deployed to Broadview on Friday, the first time NIPAS has appeared at the ICE facility protests.

NIPAS was not listed in the unified command’s initial press release, but the officers reportedly swapped in to relieve some state troopers from the scene.

A spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement that officers from the unified command “show their faces, they have proper identification, and they are accountable to the people of Illinois.” The RoundTable on Friday, though, spotted multiple state troopers and NIPAS officers without names or ID numbers, wearing face masks, or both.

TRUST Act compliance

The heavy presence of state and local police, at times seen side-by-side and conversing with federal agents, led some people in the crowd and online to question whether the unified command was violating the Illinois TRUST Act, which prohibits local and state law enforcement in Illinois from supporting or assisting civil immigration enforcement “in any capacity.” The law says this includes “collateral assistance” and specifically identifies “establishing a security or traffic perimeter surrounding such operations” as an example of banned activities.

State officials defended the operation, however, as concerning public safety rather than ICE actions. Pritzker’s spokesperson said the unified command “will prioritize public safety above all else and take steps to safeguard the First Amendment rights of the public.” In a separate statement, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul wrote that the command’s purpose is to “maintain public safety and the ability to lawfully exercise First Amendment rights — not to engage in federal immigration enforcement.”

“State and local law enforcement do not violate the TRUST Act by establishing and maintaining designated protest areas and ensuring the unobstructed use of public roads,” Raoul said, “even if federal immigration enforcement activity is occurring nearby.”

Abughazaleh and Amiwala, who were present again Friday morning along with Mayor Biss, strongly disagreed with the deployment. Abughazaleh said during a press conference with other residents and elected officials that the “very existence” of designated protest areas implies “there are places where our First Amendment rights do not apply.”

“I understand why the state police have been deployed. It’s to make sure that ICE doesn’t have unilateral control,” Abughazaleh told the RoundTable after the press conference. “At the same time, I worry that sets up a precedent that they [ICE] can do whatever they want. … What we’re asking at this press conference and in general is to follow the damn law.”

Amiwala said later Friday morning that local police should not be “collaborating” with ICE “either which way,” whether in arrests around the area or in protest control outside the Broadview facility.

“If ICE agents want to terrorize protesters, police should not be blocking off roads to make it easier for ICE to do that,” Amiwala said. “I think this should send alarm signals as well as a violation of the TRUST Act.”

Biss took a different stance: speaking to the RoundTable near the main protest just before 9 a.m., he said there “was a very dangerous situation brewing here” with ICE “trying to provoke reaction,” which necessitated the state stepping in.

“I think the state police are trying to keep protesters safe,” Biss said. “Protesters have been at risk here because of the outrageous violence [from ICE].”

The RoundTable’s interview with Biss was interrupted three separate times by protesters who recognized the mayor, two of whom rebuked his view on the unified command.

“If I’m elected, I’m gonna be fighting to abolish ICE,” Biss told one protester, “but there’s a million steps on the way from here to there — like they shouldn’t be masked, like they shouldn’t be violently attacking nonviolent demonstrators, but they also shouldn’t be kidnapping our neighbors, which is the worst part of this.”

“The question is, what’s the best way to stop the outrage of ICE kidnapping our neighbors?” he asked another demonstrator.

“Yeah, is this it?” the protester replied, referring to the unified command from state and regional police.

“I’m not sure,” Biss answered.

ICE violence elsewhere, National Guard imminent

Friday’s protest in Broadview didn’t include the tear gas and pepper spray of earlier weeks, but elsewhere in the region, ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents have continued escalating violence against residents and local officials in and around Chicago:

Early Tuesday morning, agents used helicopters and flash grenades in a militarized raid on an entire apartment building in South Shore, with apartment doors blown off and both adults and kids dragged into vans without clothes on.

On Wednesday, agents choked and arrested a Black man in East Garfield Park following a car crash.

On Friday, agents tear gassed an intersection in Logan Square near a grocery store and school, and detained a Chicago alderperson at Humboldt Park Hospital while she was trying to check on a resident injured in an ICE raid.

On Saturday, Border Patrol agents shot a woman in Brighton Park, claiming she was part of a group that “boxed in” patrolling agents and that she “was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” claims which have not yet been independently verified by local media. Chicago police were deployed to separate the agents from an angry crowd of residents, and the agents later sped off while tear gassing both the residents and police present.

Finally, on Saturday, President Donald Trump issued an order to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard troops for local deployment, though it’s unclear when or they will be deployed. Notably, however, a federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to send the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

“This morning, the Trump Administration’s Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said in a Saturday statement preempting the order. “It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.”

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,” Prtizker continued. “State, county, and local law enforcement have been working together and coordinating to ensure public safety around the Broadview ICE facility, and to protect people’s ability to peacefully exercise their constitutional rights. I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC0405-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 16:57:12.723048

The judge's decision in Portland comes as the administration deploys the National Guard to a number of American cities.
The records show police were in regular communication with federal officers at the Portland ICE facility.
Courts have been deliberating over the National Guard in California This is not the first time that the courts have weighed in on Trump's deployment of the National Guard over the objections of local officials.
""Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland,"" attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment.","A federal judge in Portland, Ore. temporarily blocked President Trump from federalizing 200 members of the state's National Guard.

U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut ruled that the government didn't meet the threshold for declaring recent ongoing protests outside an ICE facility in Portland a rebellion. She noted in her ruling that the Portland Police Bureau's 812 officers are trained in crowd management and First Amendment law. She also noted their mutual aid agreements with neighboring law enforcement agencies, as well as with the Oregon State Police and federal law enforcement, signaling that they had protests well in hand.

""If additional resources beyond all of these are critically needed, PPB may request that Oregon's Governor provide National Guard resources for a locally declared emergency,"" she wrote.

Since July, the judge's ruling said, the protests generally were limited to fewer than 30 people and were ""largely sedate.""

The ruling stated the Trump administration ""presented evidence of sporadic violence against federal officers and property damage to a federal building."" Immergut wrote that the government has not, however, offered any evidence demonstrating that those violent incidents were part of an organized attempt ""to overthrow the government as a whole.""

Immergut was appointed by President Trump in 2019.

A broader lawsuit filed Sept. 28 by the city and state asking the courts to declare Trump's deployment unlawful will move forward separately on a slower track.

The judge's decision in Portland comes as the administration deploys the National Guard to a number of American cities. Trump has sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and will soon send them to Memphis, Tennessee with the state's approval.

He's threatened to send them to Chicago, despite objections from city and state leaders there. Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, meanwhile, has requested troops to help with ""high crime rates"" in cities like New Orleans.

President Trump has said the deployments are needed to protect ICE agents as they carry out his mass deportation operations, as well as to reduce street crime. That's even though crime in some of the cities mentioned has been going down – including in Portland. The deployment to California was the first time in 60 years – since they were sent to protect civil rights activists in Alabama -- that a president deployed the National Guard over the objections of a state's governor.

Trump turned to Portland last week

President Trump announced on Sept. 27 his plan to send troops to ""war ravaged Portland."" In his social media post, the president said he was ""authorizing Full Force, if necessary"" to deal with ""domestic terrorists."" Trump did not specify what he meant by ""Full Force.""

In court documents, the Trump administration argued it was necessary to federalize the National Guard to protect federal personnel at an ICE facility in Portland that has ""experienced significant unrest targeting both the facility itself and those who work in it.""

State and local officials reject the idea that the situation on the ground requires the National Guard – saying protests outside the ICE facility have been small with no arrests by Portland Police in months until Trump's decision to federalize Oregon's Guard.

By day, legal observers, clergy and leaders from other religious and spiritual denominations stand outside the building, prepared to assist people showing up for required ""check-ins"" with ICE officials. By night, a small group of protesters – sometimes a dozen or fewer – have demonstrated outside the building.

Typically, says Portland's Police Chief Bob Day, they have largely been nonviolent and contained.

""The city of Portland is 145 square miles. And this is one city block,"" Day told reporters Monday. ""And even the events that are happening down there do not rise to the level of attention that they are receiving.""

Local officials say the protests had already dwindled

The protests are much smaller than the scores of people who for months in 2020 gathered at the federal courthouse in downtown Portland following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

On September 28, the State of Oregon and City of Portland sued to block the Trump administration from deploying troops to the state's largest city.

""In furtherance of a nationwide campaign to incorporate the military into civilian law enforcement—while also seeking to punish select, politically disfavored jurisdictions—they are preparing to deploy troops in Portland, Oregon,"" attorneys for the city and state wrote in their motion for a restraining order filed Monday. ""The facts do not remotely justify this overreach.""

In the same document, they said the Portland Police Bureau made 25 arrests at the ICE facility between June 11 and June 19 of this year, but hadn't had cause to make any more until administration announced they were deploying the National Guard. After the President's announcement Saturday, two more people were arrested Sunday. Cammilla Wamsley, a regional ICE supervisor, said in a sworn statement that federal law enforcement made more than 20 arrests over roughly three weeks this summer, separate from arrests by local police.

""On any given weekend,"" attorneys for the city and state wrote, ""the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has required PPB to dedicate greater resources than the small protests outside the ICE facility.""

Trump lawyers maintain federal agents are under threat

Lawyers for the administration countered in their own court documents that the deployment was justified because protests in Portland required the facility to close for about three weeks in June and July. They say protesters blocked the entrance, spray painted threats and doxed ICE agents online.

""Agitators have assaulted federal law enforcement officers with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices. They have damaged federal property, including by breaking office windows, security cameras, and card readers permitting entry to the building,"" they said.

On Friday, the administration announced it was investigating how Portland police have handled anti-ICE protests.

Records provided to the court by the city of Portland show throughout September before Trump made his announcement, protests rarely drew more than a few dozen people. The records show police were in regular communication with federal officers at the Portland ICE facility.

There were nights with incidents, such as Sept 20 when Portland Police noted that a Federal Protective Service officer called them ""throughout the night with info about black blockers assaulting people."" ""Black bloc"" groups wear black clothing and face coverings.

But the records show the majority of nights were calm, like the night before Trump's Sept. 27 announcement to send in the National Guard, when Portland police observed 8-15 people at any given time: ""Mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around."" Portland Police wrote, ""Energy was low, minimal activity.""

Courts have been deliberating over the National Guard in California

This is not the first time that the courts have weighed in on Trump's deployment of the National Guard over the objections of local officials. In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to confront protests against ICE operations. A federal judge ruled that the situation there did not constitute a level of interference with ICE or a ""rebellion"" against federal authority to justify sending in the troops.

But an appeals court overruled that finding, citing instances where ICE agents were ""pinned down"" and had ""concrete chunks"" and ""bottles of liquid"" thrown at them. Oregon officials tried to draw a distinction there.

""Those facts bear no resemblance to the recent ICE facility protests in Portland,"" attorneys representing Portland and Oregon argued when they asked the court to block the deployment. ""If the relatively small, contained, and largely sedated protests near Portland's ICE facility in recent weeks can justify military intervention, then the President's authority to federalize a state's National Guard … would be virtually unlimited.""

On Sept. 2, a California judge ruled that the troops in Los Angeles violated long-standing law against military forces performing civilian law enforcement by assisting ICE agents with traffic control and cordons for their operations. That ruling is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,"" Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Judge: The federal response didn't match the facts

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

White House says it will appeal

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president’s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

Portland protests were small, but grew after deployment was announced

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles (375 square km) and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.

The government agreed this year to settle an excessive force lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union by paying compensating several plaintiffs for their injuries.

We'll be ending our live coverage of this week's episode of Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg shortly. But before we do, let's catch you up on what we heard:

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was asked what the government will do to protect Jewish communities in the UK.

It comes after many said they were ""shocked, but not surprised"" by the attack on a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, which killed two Jewish men and left three others in a serious condition.

The home secretary pointed to a new announcement about expanding police powers to restrict repeat protests - but acknowledged that the government hasn't got the balance right yet.

Manchester rabbis Josh Levy and Kath Vardi told the programme that anti-Semitism has been allowed to develop and grow in the UK.

And as the Conservative Party conference looms, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch insisted that the her party's plans toremove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years will pay off.

Thanks for joining us.

Badenoch's policy proposals are shocking - and that's intentional

Harry Farley

Political correspondent, reporting from Manchester

The plan for a ""Removals Force"" is really quite radical when you look at the details. It's based on a controversial American model and would double the funding of the current unit in the Home Office.

The Conservatives have also promised an overhaul of the asylum system, with tighter restrictions on who could claim refuge. That’s all underpinned by a promise for the UK to leave the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).

These are bold policies all designed to grab attention and restore confidence as the Conservative Party conference begins in Manchester.

But a number of Conservatives are worried about the impact leaving the ECHR might have on the UK's reputation.

Kemi Badenoch will be trying to address those internal critics who are still wondering whether she is the right person to lead the party forward.

Recap: What we heard this week

If you're just catching up, let's take a quick look back at what we heard on today's programme.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was pressed on the government's response to antisemitism in the wake of Thursday's attack in Manchester at a Jewish synagogue.

She said the investigation was progressing and she had been in touch with the families of the victims.

The home secretary said Jewish people are justified in their anger at the government, adding their concerns are informing proposed new police powers over protests. She insisted that people would still have freedom to protest, but the new laws would make sure the wider community was also protected.

We also heard from two Manchester-based Rabbis who said antisemitism had been allowed to grow in the UK, and they were not surprised by the attack on a synagogue.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that protest laws needed improvement, but questioned why it had taken the government so long to address them.

She was then asked about her plans to return 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK if the Conservatives win the next election. Badenoch insisted her plans, which include leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, ""were credible"".

She also spoke about rowing back on the UK's climate commitments to ensure the country wasn't losing out commercially to foreign rivals, and defended her record as party leader, saying she maintains the backing of party members.

Badenoch won't commit to resigning if Tories don't succeed in next election

Badenoch is pushed on her plans and leadership. The Conservative Party's position has gotten worse, Kuenssberg says.

But Badenoch pushes back and says polls are not results. She is instead taking time to work on plans that won't fall apart, she adds.

The final question from Kuenssberg is: ""What if the problem is you?""

Badenoch says she was elected to do ""exactly what I am doing now"" and she believes her party will keep faith.

Asked if she will resign if things go badly at the next elections in May, Badenoch repeats that she was elected to do what she is doing now.

With that, the interview concludes.

Badenoch says government climate plans not working

The interview now moves on to Tory policies on the climate.

Badenoch says the the government's plans are not working and not stopping climate change.

She says that we've made changes to comply with the Paris agreement, but the UK is the only country in the world who have done that. She then lists climate initiatives that she says are making other countries rich at the cost of the UK.

She says companies are leaving because of the UK's environmental laws and workers are losing their jobs.

Badenoch says human rights can be protected without ECHR membership

Turning now to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which the Conservatives said they would leave, Badenoch is asked if they really want the UK to leave a decades-old European agreement.

The Tory leader lists off countries including the US, Canada and Australia, saying they are not party to the ECHR. Kuenssberg points out these are not European countries.

Badenoch says you don't need to be in the convention to have human rights. ""Our human rights existed long before the ECHR,"" she argues.

She says the UK is paying money to handle a problem that's getting more difficult.

The Conservatives have not said they would leave the Refugee Convention, Badenoch says, but they will be prepared to leave anything stopping them from securing the borders.

'I want to make sure we have strong borders' - Badenoch

Pushed by Kuenssberg to offer a plan to remove illegal immigrants from the UK, Badenoch says the Conservatives will be standing up for a force - the Removals Force - which doesn't currently exist.

She says that families of children hurt by illegal migrants want to know why the government isn't acting.

Kuenssberg pushes back, asking Badenoch how the party will make it happen.

Badenoch says funding will come from the money currently spent on housing asylum seekers in hotels and ""dealing with migration issues"".

""I want to make sure that we have strong borders, and I've come up with a plan to do it,"" Badenoch says, admitting that it will be tough.

Badenoch insists Tory plan on migration is credible

Kuenssberg says that questioning where people have to go is not irrelevant, but Badenoch says we can't have a ""defeatist attitude"" and the Tories have a credible plan.

Badenoch is asked if it's a credible plan, where will the people go? She answers ""not here"".

""We need to have stronger borders"", Badenoch says. She says that the plans are not just about deporting 750,000 people, it's about leaving the ECHR, banning asylum claims from people who have arrived illegally and the return scheme.

Where would migrants removed from UK go?

Kuenssberg moves onto the Conservative pledge to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election.

Where would they go? Kuenssberg asks Badenoch.

The Tory leader says there are too many people in the UK that shouldn't be here, and they need to go back to their countries. She adds that the Tories had a Rwanda plan ""that worked"".

Pushed again on where would people go, Badenoch says ""not here"".

""They should not be here, we need to look after the our people,"" she adds, calling the question of where they would go ""irrelevant"".

Badenoch asks why plan to restrict repeat protests 'took so long'

Laura Kuenssberg turns now to Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, ahead of the party's conference in Manchester over the next few days.

She begins by asking Badenoch if she backs the government's proposals over restricting repeated protests.

Badenoch says yes, but questions why it ""took so long"". She also questions why the public should trust Mahmood, after the home secretary protested outside a branch of the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain in 2014 to call for it to stop stocking goods from Israeli settlements.

She adds that the Jewish community is very concerned that the government won't support them.

Rabbis say antisemitism allowed to grow in the UK

We're now hearing from Josh Levy and Kath Vardi, two rabbis from Manchester.

Levy says for many of the Jewish community, the synagogue attack was a ""matter of when, not if"".

It isn't normal to have to have security outside a place of worship, Levy tells Kuenssberg, and says antisemitism has been allowed to develop and grow in the UK.

The line between protesting and inciting hate is narrow, Kath Vardi adds, continuing that people need to be held responsible for the messages that they're shouting at protests.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/9b4d/live/99140590-a1c9-11f0-aa4e-41121ee831f6.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 07:57:33.932013

WASHINGTON – This morning, Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, driving one of the vehicles, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxxing federal agents. She took defensive fire from CBP agents and has been discharged from the hospital and is currently in the custody of the FBI. The driver of another vehicle, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, involved in the ramming has been apprehended by law enforcement.

The scene became increasingly violent as more domestic terrorists gathered and began throwing smoke, gas, rocks, and bottles at DHS law enforcement. Another domestic terrorist was arrested for assaulting CBP at the scene. Following JB Prtizker’s refusal to allow local police to help secure the scene, Secretary Noem has deployed special operations teams to restore law and order.

As our ICE law enforcement was responding to the shooting, a domestic terrorist followed them and rammed their vehicle in an attempt to run them off the road. This individual has also been arrested and is in HSI custody.

An ICE vehicle popped a tire and was subsequently mobbed by domestic terrorists, forcing law enforcement to abandon the vehicle for their own safety. The vehicle was significantly damaged.

Several CBP law enforcement officers were sent to the hospital with various injuries.

Statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin:

“These attacks on our brave law enforcement officers must END. Secretary Noem has taken action to deploy additional resources to restore law and order. We will not allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement. If you law a hand on law enforcement, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Savage, www.latimes.com, david-g-savage",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-10-05/supreme-court-trump-claims-of-unchecked-power,"Supreme Court justices like to talk about the Constitution’s separation of powers and how it limits the exercise of official authority.

Last month, Trump administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to rule during the upcoming term on the birthright citizenship promised by the 14th Amendment of 1868.","Supreme Court justices like to talk about the Constitution’s separation of powers and how it limits the exercise of official authority.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts and his conservative colleagues have given no sign so far they will check President Trump’s one-man governance by executive order.

To the contrary, the conservative justices have repeatedly ruled for Trump on fast-track appeals and overturned federal judges who said the president had exceeded his authority.

The court’s new term opens on Monday, and the justices will begin hearing arguments.

But those regularly scheduled cases have been overshadowed by Trump’s relentless drive to remake the government, to punish his political enemies, including universities, law firms, TV networks and prominent Democrats, and to send troops to patrol U.S. cities.

The overriding question has become: Are there any legal limits on the president’s power? The Supreme Court itself has raised the doubts.

A year ago, as Trump ran to reclaim the White House, the justices blocked a felony criminal indictment against him related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, mob attack on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election, for which Trump was impeached.

Led by Roberts, the court ruled for Trump and declared for the first time that presidents were immune from being prosecuted for their official actions in the White House.

Not surprisingly, Trump saw this as a “BIG WIN” and proof there is no legal check on his power.

This year, Trump’s lawyers have confidently gone to Supreme Court with emergency appeals when lower-court judges have stood in their way. With few exceptions, they have won, often over dissents from the court’s three liberal Democrats.

Many court scholars say they are disappointed but not surprised by the court’s response so far to Trump’s aggressive use of executive power.

The Supreme Court “has been a rubber stamp approving Trump’s actions,” said UC Berkeley law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. “I hope very much that the court will be a check on Trump. There isn’t any other. But so far, it has not played that role.”

Roberts “had been seen as a Republican but not a Trump Republican. But he doesn’t seem interested or willing to put any limits on him,” said UCLA law professor Adam Winkler. “Maybe they think they’re saving their credibility for when it really counts.”

Acting on his own, Trump moved quickly to reshape the federal government. He ordered cuts in spending and staffing at federal agencies and fired inspectors general and officials of independent agencies who had fixed terms set by Congress. He stepped up arrests and deportations of immigrants who are here illegally.

But the court’s decisions on those fronts are in keeping with the long-standing views of the conservatives on the bench.

Long before Trump ran for office, Roberts had argued that the Constitution gives the president broad executive authority to control federal agencies, including the power to fire officials who disagree with him.

The court’s conservatives also think the president has the authority to enforce — or not enforce — immigration laws.

That’s also why many legal experts think the year ahead will provide a better test of the Supreme Court and Trump’s challenge to the constitutional order.

“Overall, my reaction is that it’s too soon to tell,” said William Baude, a University of Chicago law professor and a former clerk for Roberts. “In the next year, we will likely see decisions about tariffs, birthright citizenship, alien enemies and perhaps more, and we’ll know a lot more.”

In early September, Trump administration lawyers rushed the tariffs case to the Supreme Court because they believed it was better to lose sooner rather than later.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government could face up to a $1-trillion problem if the court delayed a decision until next summer and then ruled the tariffs were illegal.

“Unwinding them could cause significant disruption,” he told the court.

The Constitution says tariffs, taxes and raising revenue are matters for Congress to decide. Through most of American history, tariffs funded much of the federal government. That began to change after 1913 when the 16th Amendment was adopted to authorize “taxes on incomes.”

Trump has said he would like to return to an earlier era when import taxes funded the government.

“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said at a rally after his inauguration in January. “Because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.”

While he could have gone to the Republican-controlled Congress to get approval, he imposed several rounds of large and worldwide tariffs acting on his own.

Several small businesses sued and described the tariffs as “the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.”

As for legal justification, the president’s lawyers pointed to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. It authorizes the president to “deal with any unusual or extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.”

The law did not mention tariffs, taxes or duties but said the president could “regulate” the “importation” of products.

Trump administration lawyers argue that the “power to ‘regulate importation’ plainly encompasses the power to impose tariffs.” They also say the court should defer to the president because tariffs involve foreign affairs and national security.

They said the president invoked the tariffs not to raise revenue but to “rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders.”

In response to lawsuits from small businesses and several states, judges who handle international trade cases ruled the tariffs were illegal. However, they agreed to keep them in place to allow for appeals.

Their opinion relied in part on recent Supreme Court’s decisions which struck down potentially far-reaching regulations from Democratic presidents on climate change, student loan debt and COVID-19 vaccine requirements. In each of the decisions, Roberts said Congress had not clearly authorized the disputed regulations.

Citing that principle, the federal circuit court said it “seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”

Trump said that decision, if allowed to stand, “could literally destroy the United States of America.” The court agreed to hear arguments in the tariffs case on Nov. 5.

A victory for Trump would be “viewed as a dramatic expansion of presidential power,” said Washington attorney Stephanie Connor, who works on tariff cases. Trump and future presidents could sidestep Congress to impose tariffs simply by citing an emergency, she said.

But the decision itself may have a limited impact because the administration has announced new tariffs last week that were based on other national security laws.

Last month, Trump administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to rule during the upcoming term on the birthright citizenship promised by the 14th Amendment of 1868.

They did not seek a fast-track ruling, however. Instead, they said the court should grant review and hear arguments on the regular schedule early next year. If so, a decision would be handed down by late June.

The amendment says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States.”

And in the past, both Congress and the Supreme Court have agreed that rule applies broadly to all children who are born here, except if their parents are foreign ambassadors or diplomats who are not subject to U.S. laws.

But Trump Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer said that interpretation is mistaken. He said the post-Civil War amendment was “adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children, not to the children of illegal aliens, birth tourists and temporary visitors.”

Judges in three regions of the country have rejected Trump’s limits on the citizenship rule and blocked it from taking effect nationwide while the litigation continues.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29e0eff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6123x3215+0+435/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F9e%2F831abe4e4ae69296cd11f8bb770d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2203860656,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:32.955435

,Policy,2025-10-05 11:16:41+00:00,Axios,How the U.S. bypassed rules to rush deportees to Africa - Axios,Brittany Gibson,,,,,https://www.axios.com/2025/10/05/us-trump-deport-criminals-africa,"It's unclear whether U.S. officials gave those deportees' home countries a chance to accept the return of their citizens — as has long been required by law — before sending them to the prisons in Africa.
A Mexican man was sent to South Sudan despite the Mexican government's policy of always accepting its citizens deported from the U.S.
It's unclear whether U.S. officials tried to contact Mexico before sending the man to South Sudan.
In the case of a Jamaican man who was sent to Eswatini, Jamaican officials say they learned of his deportation from media reports, not U.S. officials.
Eswatini agreed to accept 160 deportees for $5.1 million, according to a copy of the agreement signed May 14.","The Trump administration's rush to quickly deport immigrants with criminal records has led U.S. officials to send several men to prisons in Africa even though their home countries would have taken them back, Axios has learned.

Why it matters: President Trump's team has justified deportations to prisons in Eswatini and South Sudan by claiming that no other countries — including the immigrants' homelands — would accept criminals ousted from the U.S.

But foreign government officials, immigration attorneys and court filings indicate that wasn't the case with at least two groups of deportees this summer that included a dozen migrants from Mexico, Vietnam and Jamaica who'd been convicted of crimes such as murder and robbery.

It's unclear whether U.S. officials gave those deportees' home countries a chance to accept the return of their citizens — as has long been required by law — before sending them to the prisons in Africa.

Zoom out: Unlike the hundreds of Venezuelans the Department of Homeland Security deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador — or the dozens of asylum seekers sent to Costa Rica and Panama — the two groups of deportees whose cases were examined by Axios had judges' orders to be removed from the U.S.

For such deportees, U.S. law requires judges to designate a preferred country or the deportee's country of origin as the priority destination.

A second option is for the deportee to be sent to a country with which he or she has ties. Deportation to a ""third country"" unfamiliar to the deportee is only a last resort.

What they're saying: ""The Trump administration has just skipped all of those steps"" and simply moved immigrants ""to a country that's willing to accept them — and that, we think, is a clear violation of statute,"" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney leading a class-action lawsuit againsst ""third country"" deportations.

""DHS does not have unfettered discretion to decide where to send noncitizens,"" one court document argues in the lawsuit.

""This is all meant to be a punitive stunt, fear-mongering stunt to play out in the media,"" Realmuto told Axios.

Zoom in: Eleven people were on the first flights to South Sudan and Eswatini despite having no ties to those countries, and several more were put on flights to Rwanda and Ghana, Axios' review of the cases found.

A Mexican man was sent to South Sudan despite the Mexican government's policy of always accepting its citizens deported from the U.S. He's now been returned to Mexico.

It's unclear whether U.S. officials tried to contact Mexico before sending the man to South Sudan. ""Mexico accepts the returns of its nationals. Period. Full stop,"" said Anwen Hughes, an attorney for Human Rights First, who represented the man.

In the case of a Jamaican man who was sent to Eswatini, Jamaican officials say they learned of his deportation from media reports, not U.S. officials.

Jamaica's foreign minister said in a statement that her nation hadn't refused the return of any of its citizens from the U.S. The Jamaican deportee eventually was returned to his home country.

For a Vietnamese man deported to Eswatini and another deported to South Sudan, it appears U.S. immigration officials didn't notify Vietnam of its citizens' removals.

Tin Thanh Nguyen, an immigration attorney working on both men's cases, told Axios there's no evidence of U.S. officials requesting travel documents from the Vietnamese government, which typically starts the deportation process.

One of his clients was first told he was headed to Eswatini while sitting on the plane that was headed there, Nguyen said.

The latest: Officials in Eswatini and South Sudan now say they'll return all of the men to their native countries — eventually — despite the U.S. government's claims that wasn't possible.

""The repatriation process has already begun .... In, maybe, less than 12 months they should all be going back to their countries,"" Eswatini government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli said in an interview with South African Broadcasting.

South Sudan's foreign affairs ministry said it's also committed to returning the deportees that nation received to their home countries.

The other side: ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, you could end up in [El Salvador], Eswatini, South Sudan or another third country,"" U.S. Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Trisha McLaughlin said.

""President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens out of American communities and out of our country,"" McLaughlin added.

""Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States. Illegal aliens who commit barbaric crimes are frequently not taken back by their home countries.""

What to watch: Texts of two ""third country"" agreements, obtained by Axios, indicate the U.S. could send hundreds more deportees to Africa in exchange for millions of dollars.

Eswatini agreed to accept 160 deportees for $5.1 million, according to a copy of the agreement signed May 14.

Rwanda signed up to be paid $7.5 million to accept 250 deportees in a deal signed on June 3.",https://images.axios.com/o_baC1Y6hHmkWthjf0s1XfAJ3h4=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/09/19/1758309886071.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:35.978265

After a three-month recess, the nine justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket, and discuss appeals that have piled up over the summer. The high court will resume oral arguments to confront issues like gender identity, election redistricting, and free speech.

But looming over the federal judiciary is the return of Trump-era legal battles. The administration has been winning most of the emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since January, that dealt only with whether challenged policies could go into effect temporarily, while the issues play out in the lower courts — including immigration, federal spending cuts, workforce reductions and transgender people in the military.

In doing so, the 6-3 conservative majority has reversed about two dozen preliminary nationwide injunctions imposed by lower federal courts, leading to frustration and confusion among many judges.

FEDERAL JUDGES ANONYMOUSLY CRITICIZE SUPREME COURT FOR OVERTURNING DECISIONS WITH EMERGENCY RULINGS

Now those percolating petitions are starting to reach the Supreme Court for final review — and legal analysts say the bench may be poised to grant broad unilateral powers to the president.

The justices fast-tracked the administration’s appeal over tariffs on dozens of countries that were blocked by lower courts. Oral arguments will be held in November.

In December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.

And in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in a major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.

""A big fraction of the Supreme Court's docket will present the question: ‘can President Trump do?’— then fill in the blank. And that could be imposing tariffs; firing independent board members; removing illegal aliens; sending the military into cities like Los Angeles,"" said Thomas Dupree, a prominent appellate attorney and constitutional law expert. ""So, much of what the Supreme Court is deciding this term is whether the president has acted within or has exceeded his authority.""

The tariffs dispute will be the court's first major constitutional test on the merits over how broadly the conservative majority high court views Trump's muscular view of presidential power, a template for almost certain future appeals of his executive agenda.

Presidential prerogative or power push?

In earlier disputes over temporary enforcement of those policies, the court's left-leaning justices warned against the judiciary becoming a rubber stamp, ceding its power in favor of this president.

After a late August high court order granting the government the power to temporarily terminate nearly $800 million in already-approved health research grants, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said her conservative colleagues had ""ben[t] over backward to accommodate"" the Trump administration. ""Right when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints, the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.""

But some of Jackson's colleagues have denied they are paving the way for Trump's aggressive efforts to redo the federal government.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT WEIGHS TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER AS ADMIN OUTLINES ENFORCEMENT DETAILS

""The framers recognized, in a way that I think is brilliant, that preserving liberty requires separating the power,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh earlier this month at a Texas event. ""No one person or group of people should have too much power in our system.""

And Justice Amy Coney Barrett told Fox News' Bret Baier three weeks ago that she and her colleagues ""don't wear red and blue, we all wear black because judges are nonpartisan ... We're all trying to get it right. We're not playing for a team.""

Barrett, who is promoting her new book, ""Listening to the Law,"" said her court takes a long-term view, and is not reflexively on Trump's side.

""We're not deciding cases just for today. And we're not deciding cases based on the president, as in the current occupant of the office,"" Barrett told Fox News. ""I think the judiciary needs to stay in its lane ... we're taking each case and we're looking at the question of presidential power as it comes. And the cases that we decide today are going to matter, four presidencies from now, six presidencies from now.""

KAVANAUGH CITES 3 PRESIDENTS IN EXPLAINING SUPREME COURT'S BALLOONING EMERGENCY DOCKET

These sharp court fractures between competing ideologies will likely escalate, as the justices begin a more robust look at a president's power, and by dint, their own.

Divisive decisions

""He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,"" Trump cryptically posted on social media a month after retaking office.

Federal courts have since been trying to navigate and articulate the limits of the executive branch, while managing their own powers.

Yet several federal judges — appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents — have expressed concern that the Supreme Court has been regularly overturning rulings by lower courts dealing with challenges to Trump administration policies — mostly with little or no explanation in its decisions.

Those judges — who all requested anonymity to speak candidly — tell Fox News those orders blocking enforcement have left the impression they are not doing their jobs or are biased against the President.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TORPEDOES SCOTUS WITH EMERGENCY REQUESTS AND SEES SURPRISING SUCCESS

Those frustrations have spilled into open court.

""They’re leaving the circuit courts, the district courts out in limbo,"" said federal appeals Judge James Wynn about the high court, during oral arguments this month over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security data.

""We're out here flailing,"" said Wynn, an Obama bench appointee. ""I'm not criticizing the justices. They're using a vehicle that’s there, but they are telling us nothing. They could easily just give us direction, and we would follow it.""

Courting controversy

The president may be winning short-term victories in a court where he has appointed a third of its members, but that has not stopped him or his associates from criticizing federal judges, even calling for their removal from office when preliminary rulings have gone against the administration.

""This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!"" Trump posted on social media, after a March court ruling temporarily halting the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members.

The target of the attack was DC-based Chief Judge James Boasberg, appointed to the bench by President Obama.

Top Trump White House policy advisor Stephen Miller, in interviews, has warned against some unaccountable and ""communist crazy judges"" ""trying to subvert the presidency.""

TRUMP TURNS TO SUPREME COURT IN FIGHT TO OUST BIDEN-ERA CONSUMER SAFETY OFFICIALS

According to ananalysis by Stanford University's Adam Bonica, federal district judges ruled against the administration 94.3% of the time between May and June.

But the Supreme Court has in turn reversed those injunctions more than 90% of the time, giving the president temporary authority to move ahead with his sweeping reform agenda.

As for the rhetoric, the high court has walked a delicate path, reluctant to criticize Trump directly, at least for now.

""The fact that some of our public leaders are lawyers advocating or making statements challenging the rule of law tells me that, fundamentally, our law schools are failing,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor at a recent Georgetown University Law Center event, without naming Trump by name. ""Once we lose our common norms, we’ve lost the rule of law completely.""

Chief Justice John Roberts in March offered a rare public statement criticizing impeachment calls from the right.

But several federal judges who spoke to Fox News also wish Roberts would do more to assert his authority and to temper what one judge called ""disturbing"" rhetoric.

The U.S. Marshals Service — responsible for court security — reports more than 500 threats against federal judges since last October, more than in previous years. Law enforcement sources say that includes Boasberg, who, along with his family, has received physical threats and intimidating social media posts.

TURLEY: JUSTICE JACKSON SHOWS ‘JUDICIAL ABANDON’ IN LONE DISSENT ON TRUMP LAYOFF RULING

""I think it is a sign of a culture that has, where political discourse has soured beyond control,"" said Justice Barrett in recent days.

""The attacks are not random. They seem designed to intimidate those of us who serve in this critical capacity,"" said Justice Jackson in May. ""The threats and harassment are attacks on our democracy, on our system of government.""

The administration in recent days asked Congress for $58 million more in security for executive branch officials and judges, following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who led Turning Point USA.

Testy term awaits

A Fox News poll from this summer found 47% of voters approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing, a 9-point jump since last year when a record low 38% approved.

""Over the past decade, public confidence in our major institutions has declined,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps conduct the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""The Court’s rebound could reflect its attempts to steer a middle course on politically polarizing questions or indicate an uptick in positive attitudes toward our more venerable institutions.""

Still, by more than 2-to-1, more voters think the court is too conservative (43%) than too liberal in its decisions (18%, a low), while 36% think the court’s rulings are about right. That continues a seven-year trend.

FEDERAL JUDGES ANONYMOUSLY CRITICIZE SUPREME COURT FOR OVERTURNING DECISIONS WITH EMERGENCY RULINGS

The public's views of the court's ability to steer clear of politics will be tested this term.

Besides the two Trump-related appeals, the justices are already scheduled to decide:

At least two appeals involving LGBTQ+ rights: which public school sports teams transgender students can join; and state laws banning so-called ""conversion therapy"" for minors who may have gender identity or sexual orientation issues.

Two election-related disputes involving partisan gerrymandering and federal campaign spending coordination that each could have major impacts on the 2026 midterms and beyond.

Precedent on a precipice

But court watchers are pointing to several hot-button pending appeals where ""stare decisis"" or respect for established landmark court rulings will be tested: same-sex marriage and communal school prayer.

The high court is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to put those petitions on its argument calendar, with possible rulings on the merits by June 2026.

But other cases are already awaiting a final ruling: the use of race in redistricting under the Voting Rights Act; and independent government boards.

""I think the likeliest candidates for being revisited are the ones that involve the power of the president to fire the heads of federal agencies,"" said attorney Dupree. ""This is an old precedent that's been on the books really back since the New Deal, and it's come into question in recent years. There's been a long shadow hanging over these decisions, and I think the Supreme Court is poised to revisit those this term and in all likelihood overrule that.""

The court may have already set the stage, by using the emergency docket in recent weeks to allow Trump to temporarily fire members of several other independent federal agencies without cause. The court's liberal wing complained that giving the president that power without explanation effectively unravels the 1935 precedent known as ""Humphrey's Executor.""

KAVANAUGH CITES 3 PRESIDENTS IN EXPLAINING SUPREME COURT'S BALLOONING EMERGENCY DOCKET

""Today’s order favors the president over our precedent,"" said Justice Elena Kagan in a blistering dissent against Trump's removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board.

The court's ""impatience to get on with things — to now hand the President the most unitary, meaning also the most subservient, administration since Herbert Hoover (and maybe ever) — must reveal how that eventual decision will go"" on the merits, added Kagan.

Sotomayor said recent overturned precedents were ""really bad"" for certain groups of people.

""And that’s what’s at risk, is in each time we change precedent, we are changing the contours of a right that people thought they had,"" she said this month. ""Once you take that away, think of how much more is at risk later. Not just in this situation.""

The conservative justices in recent years have not been shy about revisiting cases that had been settled for decades but now have been overturned: the nationwide right to abortion, affirmative action in education and the discretionary power of federal agencies.

Other pending issues the justices may soon be forced to confront which could upset longstanding precedent include libel lawsuits from public officials, flag burning and Ten Commandments displays in public schools.

One justice who has been more willing than his benchmates to overrule precedents may be its most influential: Justice Clarence Thomas.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.
Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.
Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.
As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.","Kemi Badenoch plans to create a new “Removals Force” modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.

The proposals, which will be set out in more detail as the Tory conference begins on Sunday, will see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

Mrs Badenoch told the Telegraph she “wouldn’t be surprised” if US President Mr Trump “loved” her migration plan, but said she was more interested in the views of people in the UK.

She pledged to stop “silly arguments” about human rights from stopping her doing the “right thing” if she was in No 10.

The new force will be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

In the US, Ice has been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and American citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.

Immigration is to be one of the key themes of the gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system, in which refugee status would be granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants, and saying there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The Tories have said they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if they win the next election, saying the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.

Her party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.

Asked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.

“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the country needed to “send a very clear signal” that anyone arriving illegally had “zero chance of making a life in the UK”.

He told the Sunday Express: “We have to secure our borders and we have got to bring the numbers of people coming into our country right down and give everyone breathing space.”

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://www.ealingtimes.co.uk/resources/images/20038062.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-10-05 11:56:20.289009

(KOIN) — Federal agents took several protesters into custody and deployed gas and pepper balls at least three times against a crowd of hundreds who gathered for a demonstration in front of the Portland ICE facility Saturday afternoon.

There was a noticeable contingent of counter-protesters among those gathered at the ICE facility throughout the day.

The events initially began as a march from Elizabeth Caruthers Park to the ICE facility organized primarily by Portland Contra Las Deportaciones (PDXCD).

One of the protesters into taken into custody was Holly Brown, one of the organizers of the march.

Brown, who was released around 5:30 p.m., said it was “really horrible inside.”

“There’s different holding cells with, like, really harsh fluorescent lights. There’s no bedding. It’s just like concrete. And the phones didn’t work. They didn’t have phones working in the entire facility,” Brown told KOIN 6 News. “There’s, all these different, like, posters on the wall encouraging people to self-deport. It’s a really horrible, horrible place.”

She said she was charged with trespassing on federal property.

KOIN 6 News saw at least one other person released from ICE custody. Officials with the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to a KOIN 6 News request for details on how many people were arrested on Saturday.

The mood temporarily cooled down after the initial use of tear gas and protesters were seen dancing in the street. Then at round 3 p.m., after some vehicles were let through the streets near the facility, federal agents deployed more gas against protesters.

Dozens of pepper balls were also deployed by federal agents around 7 p.m. Then, shortly before 9 p.m., KOIN 6 News saw federal agents tear gas groups of people who were blocks away from the ICE facility.

“What we did not expect in the targeted arrests was the full-on pushing that they did,” protester Rainbow told KOIN 6 News. “In the pushing, I ended up getting clocked in the eye by one of the federal agents, then they started tear gassing really bad.”

Rainbow said she saw an elderly couple in the group of protesters. The woman got hit in the head with a tear gas canister and began bleeding, eventually receiving help from medics. Rainbow claimed federal agents “tear-gassed the heck out of” the man who was using a walker to move around.

Rainbow added that since there were elderly people in the group who marched, they were not expecting this level of force.

“Pepper bullets? Yeah. Tear gas? no,” she said.

A large presence of Portland police were also observed in full gear and staged a few blocks away from the ICE facility.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/ice-facility-macadam-h-10042025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-05 07:58:05.681503

I don't like to speak only in economic terms, but various organizations have estimated the need for some 300,000 foreign workers each year to sustain our welfare state.
— What gives me confidence is the migration agreement between the PSOE and Junts.
That's why a created concern is not the same as a real concern.
I insist on differentiating between a created concern and a real concern.","MadridA week after the Congress of Deputies rejected the delegation of immigration powers to the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and the PP proposed a ""points-based visa"" to control new arrivals, ARA interviewed the minister in charge, Elma Saiz.

We don't know when the next elections will be, but it seems that immigration will be one of the main topics of debate. Why?

— This is happening not only in Spain, but across all international agendas. For example, President [Donald] Trump's migration policy is instilling fear and causing pain. In Spain, we are committed to implementing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum from a humanist perspective. Migratory flows are inherent to human beings, not only because of the complex international context we are currently experiencing, but also because of climate change, so it's important to consider how migration policy is managed.

Last week, the People's Party (PP) proposed a points-based visa. What do you think?

— If you can call them proposals... The PP twisted and presented a reality that doesn't fit with what's happening. They talk about uncontrolled migration, and the figures refute this. Illegal arrivals represent only 6% of the total. We're looking at affiliation data in which foreigners play a very important role. These two issues alone dismantle the false narrative that the PP is trying to present about uncontrolled migration. They're trying to create new proposals, but what they are is a bravado of xenophobia and racism. The points-based visa is a regulatory aberration that contravenes European regulations and the Constitution, and is discriminatory. Mr. [Alberto Núñez] Feijóo would do well not to be swayed by misinformation and lies in the purest far-right style.

Is there first-class and second-class immigration?

— This is what the far right and the People's Party (PP) are playing with. They're trying to instill in society the idea that foreigners come to collect a state allowance, when the regulations themselves, for example, regarding the minimum living wage, require legal residency for at least one year. And they're also playing on the perception that there is a much larger foreign population, when the data doesn't reflect this; or on the perception that 40% are unemployed. It's important to dismantle this with data.

Is the right successfully setting the agenda on immigration?

— They're not setting the agenda. What's happening is that the PP has chosen to buy into the far-right's framework and create an irresponsible opposition. The reality is stubborn: Spain is a land of opportunity. Various international organizations assess the macroeconomic data and point out that they are sustained by the dynamic migration. This is what's setting the agenda. And the opposition, in a supreme exercise of irresponsibility, is trying to follow what the far-right dictates, because what they're doing is competing electorally with Vox. [...] I would say to Feijóo that if your rhetoric is like Vox's or if your policies are like Vox's, PP voters, when they have to make a decision, will vote for Vox.

For the welfare state, what does the migration phenomenon represent: a threat, a challenge, or an opportunity?

— What impoverishes our country is the extreme right's way of seeing life and its policies. I don't like to speak only in economic terms, but various organizations have estimated the need for some 300,000 foreign workers each year to sustain our welfare state. And it's a reality that there are more than 3 million foreign Social Security affiliates, another 20,000 in the last month, and 200,000 in the last year. Furthermore, we are an eminently foreign country. Before a Senegalese or a Latin American arrived, our grandparents sought a life abroad, fleeing the war.

Has a dehumanizing debate on immigration been established?

— The fight against hate speech on social media is very important, and the major platforms have taken a step forward and are aware that it is necessary to be much more forceful because it dehumanizes the migrant population, which can spread to society. We saw this this summer in Torre Pacheco. That's why speeches like Feijóo's in Murcia, in which there was not a shred of humanity in a context marked by the genocide in Gaza, are irresponsible.

Together speaks of a feeling of grievance because there are immigrant families who receive lunch scholarships and, on the other hand, families native are excluded. Should Catalonia increase investment in public services and social policies?

— Never before have so many resources been placed in the hands of the autonomous communities so they can assume and address their responsibilities. On migration policy, an important agreement has been reached between the PSOE and Junts, and I find it very positive and noteworthy that an autonomous community wants to take a step forward in assuming certain responsibilities in an issue as complex as migration policy.

But is the talk of grievance justified?

— But, look. Let's look at the housing issue, for example, in Catalonia. There is a state housing law that the autonomous communities must comply with. In Barcelona, ​​specifically, housing prices have dropped by 9% because it has been declared a stressed area. This is a reflection of institutional collaboration to respond to citizens' needs. In contrast, in Madrid, Mrs. [Isabel Díaz] Ayuso is addressing not those who have problems accessing housing, but investment funds, telling them that this is the best time and place to invest. It's important to see different ways of facing reality. And what has to do with the growth in membership also translates to Catalonia. There are more people working, more people who can develop their life plans in better conditions.

What self-criticism should left-wing forces engage in to prevent certain discourses from being imposed?

— I think it's important to analyze the agreement reached between the parties. An agreement that puts it in black and white, beyond discourses that may be shared more or less, or may not be shared at all. This is an agreement that speaks of protecting the vulnerable, of a social contract that grants rights and responsibilities to the entire population, that speaks of human rights, and that speaks of exciting future projects. This is the reality, the agreements that are being reached. And, of course, we must combat the misinformation that could link the migrant population to issues that are not in line with reality.

Are you worried that a party like Aliança Catalana will drag Junts into the far-right?

— What gives me confidence is the migration agreement between the PSOE and Junts. I'm familiar with the text, which has received a lot of opinions, but I don't know if it's been read enough. The Generalitat (Catalan government) and local governments are much more familiar with the productive fabric, the needs of businesses and workers, so it makes sense for them to participate in circular immigration programs with third countries. Or, for example, to facilitate the bureaucratic process with a one-stop shop. These agreements are made to move toward a more effective policy and to put human rights at the center and combat any kind of racism or xenophobia that some people want to instill.

Do you trust Junts not to buy the Aliança framework?

— What seems important to me is the agreement [on the delegation of powers] signed with Junts.

Will they try to bring the delegation of powers back to Congress, or will they look for other avenues?

— Political parties must take a stand. The [Spanish] government will continue working to move forward and fulfill the agreements.

The number of migrants arriving in the Balearic Islands is increasing, and the Balearic government is pointing to a lack of resources. Could a situation like the one in the Canary Islands be a possibility?

— These situations are not at all comparable; the numbers are completely irrelevant. Furthermore, I want to point out that in recent weeks, a significant emergency declaration was approved very quickly, with more than 7 million euros allocated to strengthen and adapt facilities to provide an appropriate response to the Balearic Islands.

I mentioned the events in Torre Pacheco earlier. Is Spanish society racist?

— No. I think it's the far right that's trying to disrupt our coexistence and, with their outlook on life and policies, trying to make us a poorer country socially and economically. But Spanish society isn't racist.

When families are uncomfortable with their children attending school with children of foreign origin, does this reflect a society that is not prepared for demographic change and that, at its core, racism does exist?

— We analyzed the CIS (Central Statistics Institute). A year ago, we asked if migration was a concern, and we saw that the number of people who considered it a concern was significant. On the contrary, when we asked if it concerned them in their daily lives, the number plummeted. Today, a year later, it's only a problem above others for 3.2% of the population. That's why a created concern is not the same as a real concern. When in Jumella (Murcia), the PP and Vox prohibit the use of a sports center for a Muslim celebration, violating freedom of worship, it is disrupting coexistence in a population where there is no problem. I insist on differentiating between a created concern and a real concern.

In Barcelona the so-called grow expatsBut there's no debate from a migration perspective. Is there a class bias?

— Absolutely. We can see it in the case of minors. Since Putin invaded Ukraine, more than 7,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived from the country. All the regions have done their best to welcome them. This hasn't made any headlines, nor has it sparked any controversy, nor has it become politicized. Instead, we're seeing how the PP-led regions are refusing [to welcome other unaccompanied minors]. Furthermore, they're lying because they're trying to convey the narrative that there are communities that aren't included in the reception scheme, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country.

On Thursday, we learned the new membership figures. What jobs are being created?

— Job creation goes hand in hand with quality. Incidentally, in Catalonia, 19% of the workforce is foreign, five percentage points above the Spanish average. We've managed to correct problems in our labor market, and this hasn't come out of the blue. It's the result of implementing policies in the right direction.

The ILP (Proposal for a Legalization of Half a Million Migrants) remains blocked in Congress. Is the Spanish government considering expediting the process through other means?

— It's a task for the political parties. It's in Congress where it should be debated.

A new contribution scheme for the self-employed is being negotiated. Will there be an agreement before the end of the year?

— Yes, I'm optimistic. Meetings are taking place frequently, and all the stakeholders who need to be there are present. Two important issues are on the table: improving access to cessation of activity and issues related to priority.

There's also no agreement on progressive sick pay for workers. This has raised concerns among unions about whether they're buying into employers' narratives about absenteeism. Do you think some workers are taking advantage of sick pay?

— I wouldn't put the focus on workers. Health is the focus, and no one in that country can work while on sick leave. We're putting measures on the table to advance the improvement of rights, and this has to do with this gradual reinstatement once discharged.

How do you ensure that workers are not pressured to return for fear of losing their job?

— A worker cannot work while on sick leave; they can only return to work when they receive a doctor's release. We're talking about a return to work that isn't from zero to one hundred percent, but rather progressive. For example, after a cancer treatment, under medical criteria, a worker can return to work gradually. I insist: medical criteria, voluntary return, and the health of workers are at the heart of the proposal.

Are you confident of closing the deal before the end of the year?

— I am an optimist.

Your predecessor, José Luis Escrivá, said in an interview with ARA that in Spain ""a cultural change is needed to ensure that people work more between the ages of 55 and 75"" and avoid early retirement. Do you agree with this?

— It's important to keep in mind the voluntary nature of decisions, ensuring that they have nothing to do with insufficient pensions. Extending the retirement age or working a few hours and counting them toward your pension, which is what we're talking about, cannot be conditioned on insufficient benefits. That's why it's so important to revalue pensions, guaranteeing security for pensioners and offering voluntary options to also take advantage of senior talent. The way we live, work, and life expectancy have changed.

Regarding the revaluation of salaries. Do you understand why young people are wary when an income agreement is requested and salaries are raised by 2% or 3% and the maximum pension by 8.5%?

— Trying to pit the elderly against their grandchildren is a perverse and dangerous war. Young people should know that many of the policies we are implementing are aimed at them: the minimum wage, extending maternity and paternity leave to 19 weeks... But, evidently, we are committed to guaranteeing this pension revaluation by law. Pensioners don't appear overnight; they are people who have been contributing to the system for 30 or 40 years, and we must provide them with security, social justice, and guarantee their pensions.

Is the Spanish government doing everything it can [in the face of the conflict] in Gaza?

— It's the government in the world that's doing the most to promote the resolution of both states, to achieve peace in Gaza, to demand an end to the genocide, to protect the flotilla through consular and diplomatic work. This is what the Spanish government is doing.",https://static1.ara.cat/clip/b2c87563-f539-419e-b99c-3bfe9cb17f3b_facebook-aspect-ratio_default_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 07:57:57.108392

Now, as the Supreme Court begins a new term on Monday, the legal basis of these rulings is facing fresh scrutiny.
More than half of Americans disapprove of how the Supreme Court does its job, according to Gallup, with a 65-point gap between how Republicans and Democrats view the conservative-dominated court.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration about 80% of the time, according to a study by professors at Washington University and Penn State.","Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has notched a run of wins at the Supreme Court, which has overturned or stayed multiple lower-court rulings. These emergency rulings, typically brief, unsigned orders, have served to greatly expand the power of the presidency and remove constraints on the executive branch.

Now, as the Supreme Court begins a new term on Monday, the legal basis of these rulings is facing fresh scrutiny. The nine justices, of whom three were appointed in President Donald Trump’s first term, must issue conclusive, reasoned rulings on some of Mr. Trump’s most controversial policies, from emergency tariffs to birthright citizenship and immigration enforcement. The stakes are high for the administration, the contours of U.S. democracy, and for the court itself, which faces searing questions about its political tilt and institutional integrity.

If the emergency docket was a pit stop, the 2025-26 term is when the rubber meets the road.

Why We Wrote This

Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the Supreme Court has granted his administration an unprecedented 30 emergency docket rulings. With the new term opening Monday, the justices must now begin to explain the legal reasoning behind their decisions.

“This is an administration in a hurry. It tries to push all obstacles out of its way,” says Joseph Kobylka, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University. He adds, “This is an administration that is incredibly aggressive about advancing executive power.”

The nation’s highest court will be in the spotlight in an era of rising polarization and distrust. More than half of Americans disapprove of how the Supreme Court does its job, according to Gallup, with a 65-point gap between how Republicans and Democrats view the conservative-dominated court. (Gallup found 43% of those it polled in September see the body as “too conservative.”)

Perhaps the biggest question of all is how an unpopular court would muster its own legitimacy to stand up to the president, if his actions were unlawful. And if it does, would it risk seeing its rulings ignored or sidestepped, potentially upending the rule of law it is tasked to uphold?

“The court is terrified of having a head-on confrontation with the executive branch and making an order that the president won’t follow,” says Dan Farbman, an associate professor of constitutional law at Boston College. “What we’re going to see is a balance between the court’s institutional power, how much power it feels like it has, how many powers it’s willing to exert, and [its] legal reasoning.”

There have already been reported instances of noncompliance by the administration with federal court orders, notes Aziz Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago. This implicitly puts pressure on the Supreme Court not to confront the executive, since officials are suggesting they are willing to defy rulings that go against them, he says. But this political pressure makes it all the more important to impose lawful constraints – and to see that they are carried out.

“A world in which the executive threatens something and the court accedes regardless of the legality of the thing in question is just as bad as a world in which the executive doesn’t obey court orders,” says Professor Huq, who teaches constitutional law.

There are different views on whether people should trust the court intrinsically. Some people believe the court should be viewed as legitimate, regardless of its decisions, and others think the court is legitimate only when they agree with rulings, says Professor Huq.

The Supreme Court was viewed “with a large measure of distrust” by state courts before the Civil War, he says. “An interesting contrast today is you have this rumbling distrust coming not from state courts ... but from lower court judges.”

Examining the court’s legitimacy as a legislative check shouldn’t be conflated with whether its decisions are viewed as right or wrong politically, says Thomas Berry, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Constitutional Studies. “Even the justices shouldn’t like the policy outcome of every case they’re deciding, because legal questions are often different from policy questions.”

What is Humphrey’s Executor and why does it matter?

Among the politically charged cases on the docket for this term, which runs through next June, are the firings of commissioners at independent federal agencies. The administration argues that these agencies are part of the executive branch and that board members serve as the president’s pleasure. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, has held that appointees can only be removed for malfeasance and neglect of duty.

Conservative justices have said, however, that this precedent should be revisited. Judicial activists on the right have long sought to defang agencies that they view as overly independent and duplicative in ways that have exacerbated federal government bloat.

“You have a majority of the Supreme Court that pretty clearly disagrees with Humphrey’s Executor but has not yet overruled it,” says Mr. Berry.

The Trump administration has fired senior officials at several independent agencies. One, Rebecca Slaughter, an appointee at the Federal Trade Commission, successfully sued against her removal; her case, which was upheld on appeal, has been accepted by the Court. (Two other board members of independent agencies have asked for their firings to be reviewed.)

A separate employment case concerns Lisa Cook, a governor at the Federal Reserve, whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of improper mortgage documentation. After she sued, a lower court ruled that she should stay in her position; the Trump administration wants the Court to overturn that decision. Analysts say the Supreme Court may be less inclined to lessen the Federal Reserve’s independence, given its stature as a linchpin in the U.S. economy. (Ms. Cook remains in her post; the Court will hold hearings in January.)

Are President Trump’s tariffs constitutional?

Another case with broad economic consequences concerns the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Most of the tariffs imposed on foreign-made goods since January have been under a 1977 Act of Congress that had never been used for this purpose. The White House argues that its declaration of a national emergency under the act allows it to impose global tariffs.

“It’s hard to argue that this isn’t the most important case of the term,” says Mr. Berry. (Cato has filed amicus curiae briefs in federal court contesting the tariffs.)

How the Supreme Court decides the tariffs case, which lower courts have found unlawful, will have practical as well as constitutional implications. Importers have already paid hundreds of billions of dollars to the government that they would seek to recoup if the emergency tariffs are struck down, potentially widening the federal deficit. Administration officials have said they would find other ways to impose tariffs if they lose the case which will be heard in November.

Michael McConnell, a former appeals court judge appointed by President George W. Bush, has compared the tariffs case with a 1952 ruling, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that President Harry Truman couldn’t take control of steel mills to supply armaments for the Korean War. It laid down the principle, Mr. McConnell wrote in a New York Times op-ed, that “even in an emergency, the president cannot take upon himself powers that are granted neither by the Constitution nor by congressional statute.”

If the Trump tariffs are upheld, it would, by contrast, “be a major step toward a presidency that does whatever the president wishes to do,” wrote Professor McConnell, who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University.

What will happen with birthright citizenship?

Perhaps the most controversial, and to many legal scholars the most tendentious, case involves the administration’s efforts to end birthright citizenship. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868, states that all persons “born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

In a Jan. 20 executive order, Mr. Trump ordered that children born in the U.S. not automatically qualify for citizenship if their parents are in the country illegally or temporarily. A flurry of lawsuits followed, resulting in nationwide court injunctions against the order. In June, the Supreme Court struck down the use of nationwide injunctions, but didn’t rule on the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship. The justices, however, left the door open to a class action suit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed. Multiple judges subsequently blocked the executive order from taking effect. Last week, the Trump administration asked the court to rule on the merits of its interpretation of the 14th Amendment.

The court ruling on court injunctions was a technical parsing of law that sidestepped the political minefield of who is and isn’t a citizen. But if the court does, as expected, take up the birthright case, it would be a stiff test of the porous divide between law and politics, say legal scholars.

“The court takes great pains, and Chief Justice Roberts has tried to do this in his opinions and public statements, to say the court is not a political entity but a legal entity,” says Professor Kobylka. Its institutional legitimacy rests, in part, on the idea that it’s above politics. But that idea is increasingly challenged both by its partisan tilt and rising public skepticism.

The unprecedented use of the emergency docket by this administration – 30 grants of emergency relief so far – has ratcheted up this tension, says Professor Huq.

In one such emergency ruling, the Supreme Court recently overturned a California district court ruling that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had unlawfully used racial profiling in its dragnet for unauthorized immigrants. In another ruling in July, the justices allowed the administration to proceed with mass firings of federal workers.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration about 80% of the time, according to a study by professors at Washington University and Penn State. By contrast, in the lower federal courts, “you have a mix ideologically of Republicans and Democrats deciding against Trump in about 95% of cases,” says Professor Huq.

Conservatives argue that federal justices in blue states, where many lawsuits are filed, are overreaching by obstructing the Trump administration. Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, has called this a “failed lower court revolt” that threatens the judicial order. He noted that Mr. Trump also faced pushback in his first term from lower-court judges.

“As soon as Trump began his second term, federal judges resumed their skepticism of everything Trump does. But what’s different this time is that the Boston [Brahmin] of the judiciary, determined to save the rule of law, are pushing back against the Supreme Court itself,” wrote Professor Blackman, who serves on a Trump-appointed advisory board on religious liberty.

Other scholars say these cases result from confusion, not defiance: Emergency rulings by the court that overturn federal court decisions, for example, on the removal of agency officials, without formally overturning the 1935 precedent, leave lower-court judges unsure how to apply the law.

Full hearings, followed by formal rulings that supersede the shadow docket, would end this dilemma while also pitching the Supreme Court into the political arena, where it prefers not be.

“Right now, the court’s been able to sort of give the administration a break without having to fully defend itself, to defend its reasons. But when it finally decides these cases, it has to actually write up the reasons for what they’re doing. And that could mean big changes in constitutional law, or it could mean a confrontation with the president,” says Professor Farbman.",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/10/1003_NNEWTERM_LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-10-05 07:58:19.385314

The court on Friday joined four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily -- and by extension, their children -- cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration's interpretation is countered by the amendment's history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats -- both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority -- were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause's application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court's conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order's February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

""The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,"" wrote Chief Judge David Barron. ""It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.""

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to ""being vindicated by the Supreme Court.""

Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211214688_211213090-643b85249e794de5a8af7ec8e3f00dc9_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-10-05 06:57:25.431134

As The New York Times reported late Friday, a presidential determination dated September 30 and signed by President Donald Trump showed that the president aims to cap refugee admissions at 7,500 in 2026 — a significant decrease from the 40,000 that he previously discussed with officials, and from the 125,000 cap set by the Biden administration last year.

A White House official told the Times that the refugee limit would be final only after the administration consults with Congress, as it’s required to do under the Refugee Act. They added that consultation with the House and Senate Judiciary committees will be possible only after Democrats and Republicans reach a deal to fund the government and end the shutdown that began October 1.

But advocates and Democrats have pointed out in recent days that the White House’s deadline for consulting with lawmakers on refugee limits for next year was September 30, before the shutdown began.

As the deadline passed this week, Democratic leaders said that “in open defiance of the law, the Trump administration has failed to schedule the legally required consultation.”

“Despite repeated outreach from Democratic and Republican committee staff, the Trump administration has completely discarded its legal obligation, leaving Congress in the dark and refugees in limbo,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement; Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee; and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), ranking member for the Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration.

The president effectively suspended the U.S. State Department’s 40-year-old refugee resettlement program on his first day in office. The program requires refugees fleeing conflict, famine, and persecution to pass background checks and medical exams before entering the country, and often involves yearslong waits in refugee camps before they are resettled in the U.S.

“What began as a so-called ‘suspension’ has now stretched into an eight-month shutdown, betraying the nation’s promise as a refuge for the oppressed,” said the Democrats. “Nearly 130,000 people facing persecution abroad who have already passed the rigorous vetting requirements of our refugee program have been abandoned by this administration, left to languish in refugee camps around the world after being given the promise of safety and a new life in America.”

But for white South African farmers, also known as Afrikaners, Trump carved out an exception earlier this year that will reportedly be extended into 2026 — allowing them “to skip the line and rigorous vetting as countless others are shut out of the U.S.,” said the Democrats.

Trump and his billionaire megadonor, South Africa-born Elon Musk, have helped spread false claims that the country’s democratically elected Black government has systematically oppressed white Afrikaners, who enforced a racist apartheid system until 1994, and has allowed white farmers to be murdered — saying white people in the country face a “genocide.”

White South Africans hold 20 times the wealth of Black people in the country despite making up just 7% of the population, and control the vast majority of land.

“Poor Black citizens of South Africa are far more likely to be victims of violent crime and murder than white people,” wrote Joe Walsh at Current Affairs last year, noting that during one period, “when there were 49 murders on farms across the entire country, one of Cape Town’s predominantly Black townships called Khayelitsha recorded 179 murders, at a rate of approximately 116 per 100,000 people.”

While Trump plans to open the door to thousands of white South Africans, said Danilo Zak, director of policy at Church World Service, “more than 100,000 refugees from Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, etc., who have been through years of vetting, approved, [are] now left stranded.”

With Trump’s determination on refugee numbers “already signed and dated,” said Zak, it’s impossible for Trump to have completed an “appropriate consultation” with Congress to approve the abandonment of refugees across the world.

Trump previously set a record low number for refugee admissions during his first term, imposing a cap of 15,000 slots for resettlement.

The new plan was reported as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the second time in four months in favor of allowing the president to revoke Temporary Protected Status for 300,000 Venezuelans, putting them at risk for deportation — despite an earlier ruling by a federal judge who found Trump had acted illegally when he moved to revoke TPS.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2199006633.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:57.607782

Iranian state media also reported a sharp increase in returns through the Dogharoon border in Khorasan Razavi province, with officials saying between 2,000 and 3,000 Afghans are crossing back into Afghanistan every day. Amirullah Shamaghdari, the province’s deputy security and law enforcement chief, told IRNA that more than 80 percent of Afghan migrants in the province have already returned this year.

He said over 90 percent of those returns were voluntary, while around 10 percent involved deportations following police identification. Shamaghdari added that June and July saw the highest number of returns and announced that a new biometric registration system at Dogharoon would begin operating next week to track cross-border movement in real time.

IRNA reported that undocumented Afghans identified in 11 Iranian provinces are being sent back through three official crossings — Dogharoon in Khorasan Razavi, Milak in Sistan and Baluchestan, and Mahiroud in South Khorasan.

The surge in deportations from Iran and Pakistan has placed additional strain on Afghanistan, which is grappling with widespread poverty, unemployment and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Aid agencies warn that the influx of returnees is overwhelming border facilities and local communities already struggling to provide basic services.

Many returnees say they face an uncertain future. “There are no jobs, and women are not allowed to study or work,” one returnee told Amu, adding that he had lived in Pakistan for years before being forced to leave.

India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.","A coalition of unions, employers and religious groups filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to block President Donald Trump’s bid to impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly-skilled foreign workers.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.

Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organizations. They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa program.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.

Supporters and Critics of H-1B Visas

Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programs say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.

Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.

Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.

Trump in his unprecedented order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.

He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B program have undercut its integrity and that the program threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology. He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B program threatens the country’s economic and national security.

Plaintiffs Argue Trump Overstepped Authority

The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa program and cannot under the U.S. Constitution unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.

“The Proclamation transforms the H-1B program into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.

The groups argue that agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. State Department likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”

H-1B Program Scope and Global Impact

The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees. The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.

India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data.

Pope Francis’s openness to the LGBTQ community, advocacy for migrants and critiques of unrestrained capitalism saw him run up against strong conservative opposition inside and outside the church.

Leo, after gently dipping his toe into the US political fray, is now facing criticism from similar quarters to Francis. The opposition is coming from conservative Catholics in the US and MAGA supporters, some of whom, after Leo’s election, had hoped he would take the church in a different direction from Pope Francis.

The first American pope was asked on Tuesday about plans by the cardinal in Leo’s home city of Chicago to give an award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Senate Democratic leadership. Cardinal Blase Cupich, an ally and friend of the pope, was planning to give Durbin a “Lifetime Achievement Award for support to immigrants,” but the move faced a backlash given Durbin’s support for abortion rights. Durbin decided to refuse the honor.

Unusually, around 10 US bishops even spoke out publicly against the award. Two of those who did – Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone and Bishop Thomas Paprocki – were both appointed a religious liberty advisory body by US President Donald Trump and had been at odds with decisions made by Francis.

Rather than condemn the award, Leo said it was important to look at Durbin’s “40 years of service in the United States Senate.” The pope then said that it’s “not really pro-life” to oppose abortion and support the death penalty, while also questioning whether it was “pro-life” to support the “inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States.”

Leo’s comments were immediately criticized. One conservative Catholic described it as “disappointing” and “largely irrelevant”, right-wing political commentator Matt Walsh said it was a “terrible answer from Pope Leo” and Jack Posobiec, an influencer who is supportive of Trump, posted on X simply: “Some popes are a blessing. Some popes are a penance.” Joseph Strickland, the outspoken retired bishop of Tyler, Texas, said Leo’s remarks had created “much confusion”.

The day after, however, Leo generated more MAGA opposition when he took part in climate conference where he called for action on protecting the planet and blessed some ice. It all comes during a period when Leo had a private meeting with Reverend James Martin, a leading advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, spoke up against the “pandemic of arms” following the Minnesota school shooting and criticised huge CEO salaries and singling out Elon Musk.

Is the Chicago-born pontiff positioning his papacy as a counterbalance to the Trump administration? Along with his comments about abortion and immigration, he described Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s recent speech to generals as “worrying”.

Elise Ann Allen, who recently interviewed Leo for her biography of the pope for her book “Leo XIV: Citizen of the World, Missionary of the XXI Century,” said Leo does not want to be “anti-Trump”.

“He’s open to helping and dialoguing with him. He wants to be an interlocutor,” she told CNN. “His remarks are aimed at Catholics and what he’s saying is there is a ‘consistent life ethic’. Yes, abortion is wrong but being pro-life respects human dignity in all its forms, whether it concerns the death penalty or immigrants. Being from the United States, Leo is aware that the term ‘pro-life’ is often pigeon-holed into abortion.”

For some Catholics abortion is the “pre-eminent” issue, while they question Francis’ decision to update church teaching and make the death penalty “inadmissible.”

Francis’ critics hoped that Leo’s distinct style – such as his decision to wear the red mozzetta cape after his election – might signal a course correction.

“Conservative Catholics had hoped that Pope Francis’ reforms would follow him into the tomb, that the universal church would view his papacy the way they did, as a bit of bad weather that had finally and thankfully passed,” Michael Sean Winters, a Catholic commentator, wrote in the National Catholic Reporter.

This week they were disappointed. Leo has shown he will, like Francis, try and avoid the culture wars. He doesn’t want to fuel any polarization. “They are very complex issues, and I don’t know if anyone has all the truth on them,” the Pope pointed out when asked about Durbin’s award. Leo will also speak up, when necessary, particularly on the treatment of immigrants, an issue close to his heart from his time as a bishop in Peru. While Leo’s aim is to be a peacemaker his intervention this week show he’s unafraid to face opposition when drawing lines on where the church stands.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2238069640.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-04 22:57:12.137644

She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit. She said the relatively small protests the city has seen did not justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.

“This country has a longstanding and foundational tradition of resistance to government overreach, especially in the form of military intrusion into civil affairs,"" Immergut wrote. She later continued, “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law.”

The Trump administration late Saturday filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

State and city officials sued to stop the deployment last week, one day after the Trump administration announced that 200 Oregon National Guard troops would be federalized to protect federal buildings. The president called the city “war-ravaged.”

Oregon officials said that characterization was ludicrous. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city has been the site of nightly protests that typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.

Judge: The federal response didn't match the facts

Generally speaking the president is allowed “a great level of deference” to federalize National Guard troops in situations where regular law enforcement forces are not able to execute the laws of the United States, the judge said, but that has not been the case in Portland.

Plaintiffs were able to show that the demonstrations at the immigration building were not significantly violent or disruptive ahead of the president's order, the judge wrote, and “overall, the protests were small and uneventful.”

“The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts,” Immergut wrote.

White House says it will appeal

Following the ruling, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “President Trump exercised his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following violent riots and attacks on law enforcement — we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling “a healthy check on the president.”

“It reaffirms what we already knew: Portland is not the president’s war-torn fantasy. Our city is not ravaged, and there is no rebellion,” Rayfield said in a statement. He added: “Members of the Oregon National Guard are not a tool for him to use in his political theater.”

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several U.S. cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, he proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Last month a federal judge ruled that the president's deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws. The Trump administration appealed, and an appellate panel has put the lower court's block on hold while it moves forward.

Portland protests were small, but grew after deployment was announced

The Portland protests have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles and has about 636,000 residents.

They grew somewhat following the Sept. 28 announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges. A peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

On Saturday, before the ruling was released, roughly 400 people marched to the ICE facility. The crowd included people of all ages and races, families with children and older people using walkers. Federal agents responded with chemical crowd control munitions, including tear gas canisters and less-lethal guns that sprayed pepper balls. At least six people were arrested as the protesters reached the ICE facility.

Later in the evening, federal agents again emerged from the facility and deployed tear gas on a crowd of about 100 people.

Trump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.

That deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.

Viral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/portlandnationalguard-AP25277270478928,N,,2025-10-05 08:56:39.850062

In the restraining order released on Saturday, US district judge Karin Immergut – nominated by Trump – concurred with Oregon’s assertion that Trump deploying federalized national guard troops to Portland would likely inflame rather than calm protests, just as it did in 2020.

The plaintiffs say the deployment would violate the US constitution as well as a federal law that generally prohibits the military from being used to enforce domestic laws.

The stark divide in how the two sides described the situation on the ground in Portland was evident at a Friday court hearing before Immergut.

US Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton said “vicious and cruel radicals” had laid siege to the Portland headquarters of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The decision to send 200 troops – just 5% of the number recently sent to respond to Los Angeles protests – showed restraint, Hamilton said.

Caroline Turco, representing Portland, said that there had been no violence against Ice officers for months and that recent Ice protests were “sedate” in the week before Trump declared the city to be a war zone, sometimes featuring fewer than a dozen protesters.

“The president’s perception of what is happening in Portland is not the reality on the ground,” Turco said. “The president’s perception is that it is world war two out here. The reality is that this is a beautiful city with a sophisticated police force that can handle the situation.”

For years, Trump has promoted an inaccurate narrative that Portland is a “war-ravaged” city with anarchists engaging in chronic chaos. In late September, the president designated antifa as a “major terrorist organization”. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is not a centralized organization in the US but closer to an ideology with a loose network of activists.

“Today’s ruling validates what Oregonians already know: justice has been served, and the truth has prevailed,” Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, said after the restraining order was granted. “There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security. No fires, no bombs, no fatalities due to civil unrest. The only threat we face is to our democracy – and it is being led by President Donald Trump.”

The ruling by Immergut in Portland is a setback for Trump as he seeks to dispatch the military to cities he describes as lawless over the objections of their Democratic leaders.

Trump has deployed or threatened to deploy troops in several US cities, particularly ones led by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Memphis. Speaking Tuesday to US military leaders in Virginia, the president proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

Kemi Badenoch plans to create a new “Removals Force” modelled on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency.

The proposals, which will be set out in more detail as the Tory conference begins on Sunday, will see the Removals Force given £1.6 billion and “sweeping new powers” including the use of facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.

Mrs Badenoch told the Telegraph she “wouldn’t be surprised” if US President Mr Trump “loved” her migration plan, but said she was more interested in the views of people in the UK.

She pledged to stop “silly arguments” about human rights from stopping her doing the “right thing” if she was in No 10.

The new force will be expected to “integrate closely” with the police, who will be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest.

In the US, Ice has been heavily criticised in the past year, accused of arresting both legal migrants and American citizens and targeting people based on their race.

The proposal forms part of the Conservatives’ “Borders Plan”, announced as Tory activists gather in Manchester.

Immigration is to be one of the key themes of the gathering, with “Stronger Borders” one of two slogans hanging from the front of the conference centre.

Some 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office figures, putting 2025 on course to break the record for most arrivals in a single year.

Mrs Badenoch said: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders.

“That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

Along with the Removals Force, the plan includes a radical overhaul of the asylum system, in which refugee status would be granted only to those threatened by a foreign government.

Those fleeing conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying “few people will qualify”.

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Conservatives accusing solicitors of having “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants, and saying there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

The Tories have said they would look to leave the European Convention on Human Rights if they win the next election, saying the treaty had “frustrated the country’s efforts to secure its borders and deport those with no right to be here”.

Mrs Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank in the shape of Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

She said: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”

She also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.

As she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.

Her party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.

Asked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.

“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”

A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.

“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/04/22/7939b5b7e4c1471731106187119cbca1Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5Njk4NTY1-2.81876547.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-04 20:56:37.014231

“There was no rationale to detain Bibi Harjit Kaur,” Deepak Ahluwalia, Kaur’s attorney, told American Community Media in a Sept. 24 interview. “It’s all part of their effort to fill beds.”

“Her detention was nothing short of barbaric,” said Ahluwalia. “That type of treatment would affect most people. They chose to do this to a 73-year-old woman with disabilities and health issues.”

The elderly woman was initially taken to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Bakersfield and then transferred to the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Neither her family nor Ahluwalia was informed of the transfer.

No water, harsh conditions

Kaur was not given water to take her medications, according to Ahluwalia. When she asked for water, she was given a plate of ice instead, which she could not chew because of her dentures. In Lumpkin, Kaur was forced to sleep on the floor in a crowded detention facility; she could not easily get up from the floor, as she had surgery on both knees. The strict vegetarian got only meat-based meals for her first six days in detention. She was handcuffed numerous times during transfers.

The Stewart Detention Center is a private ICE detention center operated by CoreCivic.

Kaur — a seamstress who worked at the Berkeley Sari Palace for more than 20 years — had applied for asylum when she first arrived in the U.S. in 1991 with her two young sons, after the death of her husband. Her asylum claim was based on a credible fear of persecution in India. In the 1990s, thousands of Sikhs arrived in the U.S. on asylum claims, stating that they were under threat from the Indian government and the Punjab police after the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguard.

After Gandhi’s assassination, nearly 3,000 Sikhs were killed within days. Many international civil rights organizations have claimed the “anti-Sikh riots” amounted to a genocide. In 2023, California State Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains introduced AJR2 to recognize the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as genocide. The resolution passed the state Assembly and Senate. It did not need Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature; resolutions do not require the governor’s signature. Rep David Valadao, R-California, last October introduced a similar measure in Congress.

Arrested during ICE check-in

Kaur’s asylum case was denied twice: in the last, by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in 2013. She needed travel documents to return to India after her asylum claim was denied, but had not received the necessary paperwork when she was arrested by ICE on Sept. 8 during a routine check-in at the ICE office in San Francisco. Kaur had made the necessary check-ins every 6 months for the past 12 years. Ahluwalia said she had fully cooperated with immigration authorities throughout the lengthy process after her asylum claim was denied.

Kaur’s family was unable to sponsor her for permanent residency, said Ahluwalia. An undocumented resident’s family cannot apply for sponsorship if the person is in the U.S. Kaur would have had to return to India until she was granted a family-based visa, which she could not do because of a lack of travel documents. Kaur’s family could not sponsor her “from within” — while she was still in the U.S., explained Ahluwalia.

“Harjit’s case represents a failure of our immigration system. She has been a contributing member of her community for decades, paying taxes, working legally, and building relationships with neighbors and friends. Her detention is not only cruel but unnecessary.” Family statement

Her family released a statement last week, which read: “Harjit’s case represents a failure of our immigration system. She has been a contributing member of her community for decades, paying taxes, working legally, and building relationships with neighbors and friends. Her detention is not only cruel but unnecessary.”

“She has never refused to return to India but cannot without documents,” noted the family.

India’s consul general responds

Dr. K. Srikar Reddy, the Consul General of India at San Francisco, told ACoM it is the responsibility of ICE to request travel documents for people they are deporting. No such request had been made in the 12 years since Kaur’s asylum claim had been rejected by the 9th Circuit.

“Once ICE requests travel documents, it usually takes just a couple of days for us to issue them. But Mrs. Kaur had migrated more than 30 years ago, so we had no information about her. We had to connect with Indian authorities, which took some time,” said Reddy.

Asked if Kaur faces persecution when she returns to India, Reddy stated: “She was denied by the highest appeals court. That clearly shows that her fears of persecution were unfounded.”

In a statement released to NBC News, ICE defended its deportation of Kaur, noting that she had lost all of her legal remedies several years ago. “ICE is enforcing U.S. law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more U.S. tax dollars,” read the statement.

As of 2022-23, India was the fifth largest source of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., following Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, according to the Pew Research Center. Reddy said he has seen a slight increase in requests for travel documents over the past seven months.

Trump has federalized 200 National Guard troops in Oregon, but so far it does not appear that they have moved into Portland.","The Trump administration plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker says.

Pritzker said the guard received word from the Pentagon in the morning that the troops would be called up. He did not specify when or where they would be deployed, but President Donald Trump has long threatened to send troops to Chicago.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said in a statement. ""It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to questions about Pritzker's statement.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Illinois follows similar deployments in other parts of the country. Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to help Memphis police.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to stop the deployment in Los Angeles and won a temporary block in federal court. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling that the use of the guard was illegal, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that it believes the government is likely to prevail.

Pritzker called Trump's move in Illinois a ""manufactured performance"" that would pull the state's National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs.

""For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,"" said the governor, who also noted that state, county and local law enforcement have been coordinating to ensure the safety of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago.

Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people protesting Friday near the facility, which has been frequently targeted during the administration's surge of immigration enforcement this fall.

Trump also said last month that he was sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city war-ravaged. But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when demonstrations and unrest gripped the city following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.

City and state officials sued to stop the deployment the next day. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments Friday, and a ruling is expected over the weekend.

On Friday, another federal court delivered a similar verdict.

A unanimous panel of the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston determined that President Trump cannot enforce the order. This decision aligns with four previous court rulings nationwide that have blocked the executive order.

The US Supreme Court is expected to have the final decision on birthright citizenship, as the Trump administration has already asked the High court for review.

Federal judges have repeatedly noted that the executive order conflicts with both Supreme Court precedent and the Constitution itself. Although the Supreme Court is not bound by the opinions of lower courts or even its own prior decisions, the repeated lower court losses could signal a challenging battle ahead for the administration—even before a Court that has often supported Trump’s policy actions.

The Right to Birthright Citizenship

Birthright citizenship has long been rooted in US law, widely acknowledged as granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868 to guarantee citizenship rights to Black Americans, including former slaves. The amendment’s citizenship clause states that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" are American citizens.

Lawyers for the administration have maintained that the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” language means that citizenship is not automatically extended to children born in the US unless the children have primary allegiance to the US. Accordingly, they argue, children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visitors, whose allegiance is presumed to lie elsewhere, should not receive automatic citizenship.

Advt

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson stated on Friday that the 1st Circuit’s interpretation of the 14th Amendment is flawed.

However, legal experts point to the amendment’s legislative history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings to refute the administration’s reading. Congressional debate at the time of its adoption shows lawmakers intended a broad birthright citizenship guarantee that included children of immigrants, with the “subject to the jurisdiction” phrase simply meaning subject to US law.

Historically, two groups—children of Native Americans on tribal lands and children of foreign diplomats—were the only exceptions contemplated by the clause.

Supreme Court and Lower Court Rulings

A landmark 1898 Supreme Court case recognized the US-born children of Chinese immigrants as citizens under the 14th Amendment. While the Supreme Court has never squarely ruled on the citizenship rights of children born to undocumented immigrants, a footnote in a 1982 case suggests no distinction between such children and those born to parents in the country legally.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority considered a challenge to the birthright citizenship order, but declined to rule on its constitutionality. Instead, it used the opportunity to limit lower courts’ power to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policy—an outcome favorable to the administration.

Numerous lower courts, starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, have blocked the order. The Supreme Court’s June ruling left open the possibility for nationwide orders in class-action and state-led lawsuits.

In recent decisions, judges certified a class of all children born in the US after the order’s effective date who could be denied citizenship. Others found that differing state responses to the order would not relieve its burden, as people frequently move between states and could give birth outside their state of residence.

Since citizenship status determines eligibility for certain government benefits, the affected states would need to overhaul their eligibility systems, according to the decisions by the 9th Circuit and a federal judge in Boston.

The 1st Circuit panel described the issue in clear terms, noting that birthright citizenship is firmly established and questioning the legitimacy of recent efforts to challenge it.

White House Response

White House spokesperson Jackson indicated that the administration remains confident it will ultimately prevail in the Supreme Court.

To implement the executive order, officials would require confirmation of parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers or passports, according to recent guidance. AP

A federal judge has granted Oregon's temporary restraining order on the National Guard deployment early Saturday evening.

People gathered around noon at Elizabeth Caruthers Park on South Moody Avenue. The group, which grew to several hundred people, then marched to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility on South Macadam Avenue.

Photos taken of the protesters show some of them holding signs and flowers, and others dressed up in costumes, including one person in a Handmaid's Tale costume.

At one point, a KGW crew saw federal agents use several rounds of some kind of chemical crowd control munitions — such as tear gas, mace and pepper balls — sprayed on protesters outside the ICE facility.

Holly Brown, who helped organize Saturday's protest and said that she's been protesting at the facility over the past months, stepped over the blue line on the ground marking federal property. She, along with two other people, was seemingly detained by federal agents.

Moments later, agents deployed tear gas and mace. KGW also photographed a person who said that they were hit with a pepper ball.

Much of the crowd dispersed in the immediate aftermath. KGW did not witness any violence coming from the side of the protesters.

In a news release, organizers with PDXCD accused Trump of militarizing the city, and also noted the city of Portland issued a land use violation against the ICE facility.

""I think a lot of people are very scared. A lot of people are very nervous. Sending the military after your own citizens is an egregious act,"" said Holly Brown. She said she's also been protesting at the ICE facility over the past few months.

""The people protesting at ICE are completely peaceful,"" Brown added. ""They are people who are going out there to stand up for their immigrant neighbors, and they are being painted in some press outlets and by Donald Trump as agitators, as people who don't belong here who are causing violence, and nothing could be further from the truth.""

FBI data released Thursday claims that they have made 128 arrests since June 9, but KGW has found that many taken into custody are not formally charged; those who have been charged are facing penalties, from trespassing to assaulting a federal officer.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release that federal agents “fired defensive shots” at “an armed U.S. citizen” during routine patrolling.

“Agents were unable to move their vehicles and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon,” McLaughlin stated.

“Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fire defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds.”

Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem addressed Saturday’s shooting on X, writing, “Today in Chicago, members of our brave law enforcement were attacked—rammed and boxed in by ten vehicles, including an attacker with a semi-automatic weapon.”

“I am deploying more special operations to control the scene. Reinforcements are on their way. If you see a law enforcement officer today, thank them.”

Since August, the Trump administration has deployed federal law enforcement to Chicago, citing a disputed rise in crime. ICE enforcement has grown more aggressive, including helicopter surveillance of raids and arrests of local officials and activists who oppose the operations.

Protests against ICE raids have occasionally turned violent as Saturday’s incident follows the fatal shooting of Mexican immigrant Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by an ICE officer in September.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker revealed Saturday that the Department of War gave him an ultimatum.

“Call up your troops, or we will,” Pritzker said on X, announcing that the Trump Administration intends to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard.

“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,” Pritzker wrote.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/04/20/55/GettyImages-2239016043.jpg?trim=0,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-04 22:57:26.070974

In his 16-page ruling, Crenshaw said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern”, but one stood out.

Ábrego contends that, while imprisoned in El Salvador, he suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture.","A federal judge has concluded that the Department of Justice’s prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation to El Salvador.

The case of Ábrego, a Salvadorian national who was a construction worker in Maryland, has become a proxy for the partisan struggle over Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.

US district court judge Waverly Crenshaw granted a request late on Friday by lawyers for Ábrego and ordered discovery and an evidentiary hearing in Ábrego’s effort to show that the federal human-smuggling case against him in Tennessee is illegally retaliatory.

Crenshaw said Ábrego had shown that there is “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive”. That evidence included statements by various Trump administration officials and the timeline of the charges being filed.

The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security did not immediately respond to inquiries about the case on Saturday.

In his 16-page ruling, Crenshaw said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern”, but one stood out.

That statement, by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program after Ábrego was charged in June, seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged him because he won his wrongful deportation case, Crenshaw wrote.

Blanche’s ”remarkable statements could directly establish that the motivations for Ábrego’s criminal charges stem from his exercise of his constitutional and statutory rights” to sue over his deportation “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct”, Crenshaw wrote.

Likewise, Crenshaw noted that the Department of Homeland Security reopened an investigation into Ábrego days after the US supreme court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring him back.

Ábrego was indicted on 21 May and charged on 6 June, the day the US returned him from a prison in El Salvador. He pleaded not guilty and is now being held in Pennsylvania.

If convicted in the Tennessee case, Ábrego will be deported, federal officials have said. A US immigration judge has denied Ábrego’s bid for asylum, although he can appeal.

The Salvadorian national has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the United States illegally as a teenager.

In 2019, he was arrested by immigration agents. He requested asylum but was not eligible because he had been in the US for more than a year. But the judge ruled he could not be deported to El Salvador, where he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family.

The human-smuggling charges in Tennessee stem from a 2022 traffic stop. He was not charged at the time.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Ábrego, repeatedly referring to him as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

Ábrego’s attorneys have denounced the criminal charges and the deportation efforts, saying they are an attempt to punish him for standing up to the administration.

Ábrego contends that, while imprisoned in El Salvador, he suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and psychological torture. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbc352cfd6786d568196c7d3bd98462980f733b3/947_0_5178_4143/master/5178.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20d9708a691c56f6ccf0a4587ec697f7",N,,2025-10-04 18:56:40.050581

In an earlier iteration of the case, the justices in May agreed to temporarily block a judge’s order to retain the protections.
They characterized the administration’s claim against the lower court judge as a “baseless and dangerous accusation” that did not disregard the earlier Supreme Court order.
Trump administration lawyers defended Noem’s actions and said the statute at issue did not allow such legal challenges.
“This is perhaps the most extreme sign that the Supreme Court has abandoned law for politics,” he said in a statement.","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to lift protections for more than 300,000 Venezuelan immigrants who had been living in the United States without risk of deportation.

It was the second time in four months that the justices had agreed to allow the migrants to be deported.

In an earlier iteration of the case, the justices in May agreed to temporarily block a judge’s order to retain the protections. That order was unsigned and gave no reasons. Only Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

The case then returned to Judge Edward M. Chen of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California, who ruled for a second time last month in favor of the immigrants after reviewing a new claim and receiving additional evidence. Chen said he was not bound by the Supreme Court’s order from May, noting it “did not provide any specific analysis.”

In its brief, unsigned order, the court’s conservative majority said that “although the posture of the case has changed, the legal arguments and relative harms generally have not.” For that reason, the court said, “the same result that we reached in May is appropriate here.”

The three liberal justices noted their dissent, with Jackson sharply criticizing her colleagues for a “grave misuse” of the emergency docket.

The majority, she wrote, has used its power “to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

Jackson accused the majority of wrongly “privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power over countless families’ pleas for the stability our government has promised them.”

While the court’s ruling on Friday is again temporary, it means hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrations are at risk of immediate deportation as litigation continues. After the Supreme Court’s initial order, lawyers for the immigrants said “many thousands of families were torn apart,” Venezuelans who had been protected lost jobs, were jailed and “deported to a country that remains extremely unsafe.”

President Donald Trump has tried to end the protections under the Temporary Protected Status program as part of his aggressive mass deportation efforts.

In asking the Supreme Court to halt Chen’s latest order, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that the judge’s actions were another example of “the increasingly familiar and untenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this court’s orders on the emergency docket.”

As long as Chen’s order is in effect, Justice Department lawyers told the court, the Trump administration “must permit over 300,000 Venezuelan nationals to remain in the country, notwithstanding her reasoned determination that doing so even temporarily is ‘contrary to the national interest.’”

The Temporary Protected Status program, enacted by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows migrants from nations that have experienced national disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary instabilities to live and work legally in the United States.

The case began in February, when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem tried to end an 18-month extension of protections for certain Venezuelan migrants that had been granted by the Biden administration.

Immigrants affected by the change challenged the move, saying Noem had exceeded her authority and violated administrative procedures for terminating the program. The Department of Homeland Security failed, for instance, to review the conditions in Venezuela before deciding to end the program, according to lawyers for the immigrants led by Ahilan T. Arulanantham of the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law.

They characterized the administration’s claim against the lower court judge as a “baseless and dangerous accusation” that did not disregard the earlier Supreme Court order. More broadly, they said, the justices had repeatedly directed lower court judges in other recent cases to ensure government agencies were complying with the relevant statutes.

Trump administration lawyers defended Noem’s actions and said the statute at issue did not allow such legal challenges. They urged the justices to reject what they characterized as a do-over, saying the immigrant advocates “largely recycle legal arguments that previously failed to persuade the court.”

In response to the Supreme Court’s latest order, Arulanantham derided the majority for departing from past practice, including when it allowed lower court judges to block pro-immigrant policies during the Biden administration.

In a move that has sent shockwaves through America’s immigration and employment landscape, President Donald Trump’s administration recently enacted a dramatic increase in work visa fees, requiring applicants to pay an eye-watering $100,000. The announcement, made official by a presidential decree in September, set off immediate alarm bells among employers, advocacy groups, and would-be immigrants. The fallout has been swift, with a coalition of healthcare organizations, religious institutions, university faculty, and other stakeholders filing a class action lawsuit in a San Francisco federal court, according to Bluewin.

At the heart of the legal challenge lies the assertion that the fee hike has “thrown employers, employees, and federal agencies into chaos.” The new policy, critics argue, not only jeopardizes the prospects of skilled foreign workers but also undermines key sectors of the US economy that rely on international talent.

Impact on Employers and Workers

The $100,000 fee applies to the H-1B visa—a highly sought-after route for skilled professionals from around the world to work in the United States. Traditionally, this visa has enabled American companies, from Silicon Valley tech giants to rural hospitals, to fill specialized roles that often cannot be sourced locally. Now, with the cost of sponsorship rising to a level that dwarfs previous requirements, many businesses are left scrambling.

Healthcare providers warn that the fee could exacerbate critical staff shortages, especially in underserved communities already struggling to attract qualified personnel. University administrators fear a chilling effect on academic exchange, research collaboration, and the recruitment of international scholars. Religious groups, many of which rely on foreign clergy and humanitarian workers, see the move as an existential threat to their missions.

“This isn’t just a paperwork issue—it’s a seismic shift in how America engages with the world’s talent,” said an attorney representing the plaintiffs. “It prices out not only individuals, but also the communities and institutions that depend on their expertise.”

Policy Rationale and Political Backdrop

While the administration defends the fee as a measure to “protect American jobs” and deter what it describes as abuse of the visa system, critics see it as part of a broader pattern. In recent months, the Trump White House has taken a series of steps aimed at reshaping immigration policy, from limiting the number of foreign students to proposing tuition freezes at universities that accept federal funding.

The timing is notable: the visa fee hike comes amid a wider budget standoff in Washington, with a partial government shutdown disrupting federal agencies and stoking partisan tension. Some observers suggest the move may be intended to rally the president’s political base ahead of a contentious election season, positioning the administration as tough on immigration and foreign labor.

Yet, the decision has drawn criticism even from some traditional allies in the business community, who argue that it undermines American competitiveness. “We’re shooting ourselves in the foot,” said a spokesperson for a national technology council. “Talent is global. If the US closes its doors, innovation will simply move elsewhere.”

Legal Arguments and Prospects

The class action lawsuit, now pending in San Francisco, argues that the $100,000 fee violates both statutory and constitutional protections. Plaintiffs contend that the administration bypassed required regulatory processes and failed to provide adequate justification for such a steep increase. They also allege that the fee effectively discriminates against smaller employers and nonprofit organizations, who lack the deep pockets of major corporations.

“This fee is not just unprecedented—it’s punitive,” the complaint reads. “It serves no legitimate policy goal and risks doing irreparable harm to America’s economic and social fabric.” Legal experts note that courts have previously blocked or rolled back sudden immigration policy shifts that lacked clear statutory authority or posed disproportionate harm to certain groups.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security has so far declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. The agency is reportedly bracing for a deluge of legal challenges and administrative backlogs as the new fee structure takes effect.

Human Stories Behind the Policy

Beyond the legal filings and political rhetoric, the real impact is felt by individuals caught in the crossfire. For Priya, a software engineer from India with an offer from a US startup, the dream of working in Silicon Valley now seems out of reach. “There’s no way I can afford that kind of money,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking, because I’ve spent years preparing for this opportunity.”

Hospitals in rural areas, already struggling to fill nursing and specialist positions, warn that patient care could suffer. “We rely on international medical graduates to keep our doors open,” explained a hospital administrator in the Midwest. “If we lose that pipeline, whole communities could be left without access to critical services.”

Religious charities, too, face tough choices. “Our mission is to serve those in need, but with these costs, we have to decide between hiring a needed worker or cutting back on food programs,” said a director of a faith-based nonprofit.

Broader Implications for US Immigration Policy

This latest development is part of a larger debate over the future of US immigration. Supporters of a more open system argue that America’s strength lies in its ability to attract and integrate talent from around the world. Opponents, on the other hand, claim that unchecked immigration threatens domestic wages and job security.

The $100,000 fee, whatever its fate in the courts, is already sending a message. Immigration attorneys report a surge in inquiries from clients considering Canada, Australia, or the European Union as alternatives. Universities warn that international applicants are reconsidering their plans, and some companies are quietly exploring options for relocating operations abroad.

“America has always been a beacon for those seeking opportunity,” said a university president. “Policies like this risk extinguishing that light.”

As the legal fight unfolds, one thing is clear: the $100,000 visa fee is more than a bureaucratic hurdle. It is a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle to define America’s values and priorities in an interconnected world. The outcome will reverberate far beyond courtrooms, shaping the nation’s identity—and its place on the global stage—for years to come.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tmpe5nz_l1h.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 18:56:49.876425

According to officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the incident unfolded in an area near West 39th Place and South Kedzie Avenue in Brighton Park.

DHS officials say border patrol agents were conducting a routine patrol in the area when they were allegedly “attacked and rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

Agents exited the trapped vehicle, and officials said that was when a female suspect allegedly attempted to run them over, forcing the agents to open fire.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the woman who allegedly attempted to run the agents over was also allegedly armed with a “semi-automatic weapon.”

“One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon. Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fired defensive shots at an armed US citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds,” McLaughlin said.

No agents were wounded during the incident.

McLaughlin added that the woman allegedly involved in the incident had been named in a CBP intelligence bulletin last week for allegedly doxing agents online.

“Comparing ICE day in and day out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,” McLaughlin added. “The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

Sources confirmed to Nexstar’s WGN that the woman involved suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was hospitalized in critical condition.

Officials from the Chicago Police Department said officers initially responded to the incident when it came in as a call about a person shot, but were not involved in the incident or its investigation.

According to CPD, officers responded to the scene to document the incident and maintain safety, as well as conduct traffic control for those living and working in the area.

The incident comes after weeks of clashes between protesters and federal authorities as they conduct an immigration enforcement operation dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which focuses on Chicago and Illinois.

The operation has been met with intense scrutiny from state and local leaders as well as community members, including those who make up “rapid response teams,” who have been making their presence known on the streets of Chicagoland.

Despite the pushback, more than 900 arrests have been made in the weeks since the operation began.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/AP25276537580325-e1759606425489.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-04 17:57:38.754543

Paul SeddonPolitical reporter, Conservative Party Conference, Manchester

The Conservatives say they would task officials with removing 750,000 illegal immigrants from the UK within five years if they win the next election.

Under plans unveiled as its annual conference begins, the party has pledged to ban people who enter the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum.

It would also prevent those whose claims are rejected from challenging decisions in the courts, with appeals instead handled by Home Office officials.

Border officials would be instructed to remove people ""within hours or at most a few days"", the Tories say, with a reformed ""Removals Force"" unit seeing their funding doubled to £1.6bn per year.

It comes as Tory activists gather in Manchester for their annual party conference, amid dire poll ratings under leader Kemi Badenoch and questions over how they can head off a potentially existential challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.

In the run-up to the four-day gathering, the party has already said it would end the UK's 75-year membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to thwart asylum appeals, confirming a widely-expected policy shift.

Under the latest proposals, the Home Office's immigration enforcement unit would be rebranded as a ""Removals Force"" and given wider-ranging powers, along with an extra £820m per year the Tories say could be unlocked by closing asylum hotels.

The party says it would give the new unit a ""mandate"" to remove at least 150,000 people each year, totalling 750,000 during the five-year lifetime of a Parliament.

This would include people currently living in the UK illegally, the party says, as well as future illegal arrivals and all foreign nationals convicted of a crime more serious than minor parking or speeding offences.

It would represent around a five-fold increase from the 35,000 migrants who were removed from the UK over the last year - the majority of whom went voluntarily.

'No need for lawyers'

The party says it wanted to take inspiration from the US, where President Trump has handed immigration enforcement officers sweeping new powers to arrest and deport undocumented migrants.

The Tories say they would instruct police forces to check the details of everyone they arrest against biometric borders data, and would be allowed to use facial recognition without informing the public it is in use.

It plans to expand an unspecified ""existing facility"" to detain migrants before they are removed, with a capacity for between 1,000 and 2,000 people.

The party also plans to restrict the grounds for claiming asylum to those facing a threat from the government in their home country, excluding claims from those fleeing conflict or ""less tolerant"" laws on religion or sexuality.

Key to their proposals is a plan to abolish the Immigration Tribunal, which hears challenges to failed asylum claims, handing the appeals process instead to a team of officials within the Home Office.

The Tories also plan to abolish taxpayer-funded legal aid in immigration cases, with a document on the proposals arguing there ""will be no need for lawyers"" because claims would be ""fairly assessed against the criteria"".

ECHR divide

The Conservatives' plan comes after Reform UK made similar pledges over the summer to take the UK out of the ECHR and deport 600,000 migrants within five years if it won power.

Badenoch sought to portray her party's plans as more credible, adding that it was backed by ""comprehensive legal analysis"" in the form of a review by Tory peer and former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar.

""Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival,"" she added.

The Tory move to leave the ECHR creates a key dividing line with the Labour government, which has opted against leaving the treaty but is reviewing how it is applied in UK law.

Labour has also pledged tougher action to deal with small boat crossings over the English Channel, which are set to break record numbers this year.

Labour recently set out plans to lengthen refugees' route to permanent settlement in the UK in a bid to make the country less appealing to migrants, and has negotiated a ""one in, one out"" pilot scheme with France.

Unlike Reform, the Tories are not promising to formally disapply the Refugee Convention, a 1951 treaty that prevents signatory countries from returning refugees to countries where they face serious threats to their life or freedom.

But the party says it would legislate to prevent courts having regard to it in asylum cases, with a pledge to leave if ""activist judges attempt to override Parliament"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8569/live/c19342e0-a14e-11f0-8a00-7f108f799fea.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:14.622292

The Tories say this increase in funding would come from the closure of asylum hotels and ""tackling the wider costs of our out-of-control asylum system"".

Modelled on the ""successful approach"" of the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, this new force would be given ""sweeping new powers"", and over £1bn in new funding.

The pledge is part of the Conservative Party's broad new plans to stop illegal migration to the UK, set to be unveiled by Kemi Badenoch on the first day of their annual conference on Sunday, where reducing immigration and creating ""Strong Borders"" will be one of the key themes.

The new ""Removals Force"" that she will unveil will replace the existing Home Office Immigration Enforcement (IE) and will be given broad new powers, including being able to use facial recognition without warning in order to spot illegal immigrants.

It will be given funding of £1.6bn a year, up from the existing £820 million a year, to increase the number of removals annually from 34,000 to 150,000 - which would represent ""at least 750,000 removals"" across a five-year parliament.

The Tories say this increase in funding would come from the closure of asylum hotels and ""tackling the wider costs of our out-of-control asylum system"".

However, ICE in the US has been heavily criticised by politicians and the public in recent months, with the agency accused of arresting both legal migrants and US citizens and targeting people based on their race.

Expanding the use of live facial recognition technology is also likely to attract criticism from within the Tory party itself, on the grounds of it being a threat to individual freedom and privacy.

Tories to withdraw from multiple conventions

In addition to confirming plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), announced on Saturday, Ms Badenoch will also vow to fully repeal the Human Rights Act, and leave the Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.

This, the Tories say, would ""end the legal blocks that allow illegal immigrants, and in some cases foreign criminals, to stay in the UK based on flimsy claims"".

A radical overhaul of the asylum system would see refugee status granted only to those threatened by a foreign government, and those fleeing conflict or ""less tolerant"" laws on religion or sexuality would not be eligible, with the party saying ""few people will qualify"".

The plan will also see the immigration tribunal abolished, with all decisions on migration taken by the Home Office with only limited rights of appeal in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority.

Immigration cases will be denied legal aid, with the Tories accusing solicitors of having ""defrauded"" the UK by ""coaching"" applicants and arguing there is ""no need for lawyers"" as people ""should simply tell the truth about their circumstances"".

'Labour is fixing the Tories' mess'

The plans come as Ms Badenoch faces continued pressure on her right flank from Reform UK, which has already pledged to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people over five years if it comes to power.

But the party leader said the plans put forward by Nigel Farage's party are ""nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrivals"".

She also said the Labour government offers ""failed gimmicks"", adding: ""Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis. That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.""

A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""The Conservatives' message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won't apologise, now trust us.

""It won't wash - Kemi Badenoch's party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers' money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.

The removals force is understood to be a cornerstone of a new “borders plan”, which Badenoch will announce to delegates in Manchester.
Our ‘stronger borders’ plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.","The Conservatives will pledge to create a new immigration taskforce modelled on Donald Trump’s controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, the Guardian understands.

The party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, is expected to announce the policy on Sunday as the Conservatives heads into their annual conference after a year of historic low poll ratings. The proposed “removals force” will be tasked with deporting 150,000 people a year in a move to tackle illegal immigration.

Badenoch will say that the taskforce would be given £1.6bn and “sweeping new powers” if the Conservatives win the next election. This would include the ability to use facial recognition technology without warning to help identify those eligible for removal from the UK.

Under the plans, the taskforce would be expected to “work closely” with the police. Officers would be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest, Badenoch is expected to add.

Badenoch will say that the Ice model has proved to be a “successful approach” in removing migrants who have illegally entered the US. Ice removed nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of Trump’s second presidency, US media reported. However, it has also faced widespread criticism, both for arresting legal migrants and allegedly targeting people on the grounds of their race.

Immigration is expected to be a key theme of this year’s Conservative conference, which begins on Sunday. The removals force is understood to be a cornerstone of a new “borders plan”, which Badenoch will announce to delegates in Manchester.

Analysis of Home Office figures by the PA news agency shows 34,401 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year. This means 2025 is on course to break records for the most arrivals in a single year.

Badenoch will say: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders. That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”

She is also expected to announce a radical overhaul of the asylum system as part of her borders plan. She will propose granting refugee status only to those who have been directly threatened by a foreign government. Those who have escaped conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion and sexuality will be excluded, Badenoch will say, adding that “few” people would qualify for asylum under the tightened rules.

She also wants to abolish immigration tribunals, with decisions instead taken directly by the Home Office. There would be limited rights of appeal, which would apply only in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority, it is understood.

The plans would also deny legal aid to those fighting immigration cases. Badenoch is expected to say that lawyers have “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants. Badenoch will argue there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.

Badenoch announced on Saturday that the Conservatives would remove the UK from the European convention on human rights (ECHR) if the party regains power at the next election.

She said: “I have not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans and our citizens.”

The Conservative leader faces sustained pressure on immigration from the right of her party as polls consistently show Reform could win the next election, despite the fact it currently has just five MPs. Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage, has promised to leave the ECHR and deport up to 600,000 people in its first parliamentary term if it gains power.

Badenoch will tell delegates: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our ‘stronger borders’ plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't say how much migrants would get or when the offer would take effect, but The Associated Press obtained an email to migrant shelters saying children 14 years of age and older would get $2,500 each. Children were given 24 hours to respond.

The notice to shelters from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Families and Children did not indicate any consequences for children who decline the offer. It asked shelter directors to acknowledge the offer within four hours.

ICE said in a statement that the offer would initially be for 17-year-olds.

""Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin,"" ICE said. ""Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option.""

ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department did not immediately respond to questions about the amount of the payment and age eligibility.

ICE dismissed widespread reports among immigration lawyers and advocates that it was launching a much broader crackdown Friday to deport migrant children who entered the country without their parents, called ""Freaky Friday.""

The administration has also offered $1,000 to adults who voluntarily leave the country. Advocates said $2,500 may prevent children from making informed decisions.

""For a child, $2,500 might be the most money they've ever seen in their life, and that may make it very, very difficult for them to accurately weigh the long-term risks of taking voluntary departure versus trying to stay in the United States and going through the immigration court process to get relief that they may be legally entitled to,"" said Melissa Adamson, senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law.

Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, echoed concerns about the offer, saying it ""pressures children to abandon their legal claims and return to a life of fear and danger without ever receiving a fair hearing.""

U.S. border authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021. A 2008 law requires them to appear before an immigration judge before being returned to their countries.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters since the Trump administration put them under closer scrutiny before releasing them to family in the United States to pursue their immigration cases.

The additional scrutiny includes fingerprinting, DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers. Over the summer, immigration officers started showing up and arresting parents.

Pritzker said the guard received word from the Pentagon in the morning that the troops would be called up. He did not specify when or where they would be deployed, but President Donald Trump has long threatened to send troops to Chicago.

""This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,"" Pritzker said in a statement. ""It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.""

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for additional details. The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to questions about Pritzker's statement.

The escalation of federal law enforcement in Illinois follows similar deployments in other parts of the country. Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to help Memphis police.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to stop the deployment in Los Angeles and won a temporary block in federal court. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling that the use of the guard was illegal, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that it believes the government is likely to prevail.

Pritzker called Trump's move in Illinois a ""manufactured performance"" that would pull the state's National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs.

""For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control,"" said the governor, who also noted that state, county and local law enforcement have been coordinating to ensure the safety of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago.

Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people protesting Friday near the facility, which has been frequently targeted during the administration's surge of immigration enforcement this fall.

Trump also said last month that he was sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city war-ravaged. But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when demonstrations and unrest gripped the city following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.

City and state officials sued to stop the deployment the next day. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments Friday, and a ruling is expected over the weekend.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do.","The Santa Barbara Independent republishes stories from CalMatters.org on state and local issues impacting readers in Santa Barbara County.

Three of the four California counties empowered to inspect federal immigration detention facilities have not done so, and the fourth has conducted only basic reviews of food this year, records obtained by CalMatters show.

If they were checking, local officials would be providing an additional layer of oversight at a time when the number of people held in detention centers has surged because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigrants.

Two state laws provide state, county and local officials the authority to review health and safety conditions in privately-run immigration detention facilities.

The first, passed during the first Trump administration, allows the attorney general’s office to inspect for violations of national detention standards and health or safety issues. The AG’s office has used that power to publish annual reports on conditions inside detention centers, including one this year that alleged deficient mental health care.

The second, a 2024 law, empowers counties to inspect privately run detention facilities. In the past, counties have inspected jails and prisons, finding mold, rats, and other health violations. But county health officials have not used that power to inspect federal immigration detention facilities.

In Kern County — where three detention centers operate — the health officer, through an attorney, has said in testimony before a federal judge that he has “no intention” of exercising his new authority to inspect the facilities to ensure they comply with state and local health standards.

The companies that manage the detention centers through contracts with the federal government say they take seriously their responsibility to adhere to federal standards and uphold human rights. One unsuccessfully sued to overturn the new California inspection law, alleging it was unnecessary and an intrusion on the federal government’s authority.

More than 5,700 people are in immigration detention in California, an 84% increase since the spring. On April 16, there were 3,100 people detained in the state, according to the California Attorney General’s latest report.

Advocates for detainees are drawing attention to what they describe as unhealthy conditions, including in the state’s newest detention center. It opened in Kern County without proper permits or a business license as required by state law, according to California City’s mayor.

CoreCivic’s 2,560-bed immigration detention center there sits on 70 acres in the Mohave desert about 80 miles east of Bakersfield.

A detainee who goes by the name of Loba has been locked up in the California City facility since Aug. 28. She said some detainees have not received the medication they need for more than 20 days. She asked CalMatters not to fully identify her because she feared retaliation by CoreCivic guards for speaking with a reporter.

“There’s a lack of interest on the part of CoreCivic to care for individuals with diabetes problems and people who have heart problems or any other health conditions. They’re really not caring for detainees and not giving us the proper medical treatment in detention,” Loba said.

She said she observed five people who needed emergency care because they could not get medication. Another California City detainee described similar conditions in an interview with CalMatters.

Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.

Counties reviewing inspection law

In the four counties where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has detention facilities, only one county health department conducts the kind of inspections allowed under the 2024 law. A San Bernardino County spokesperson said the county has the authority to inspect for disease control and “general health and sanitation,” but he later said the reviews are limited to the facilities’ food processing and service.

Officials from two other counties said they’ll use their new authority to respond to specific concerns, but that they had not yet done any inspections.

The Imperial County health department said it would respond to a complaint “if the facility falls within our legal authority to inspect.” The San Diego County health department said only that it “is exploring how to effectively operationalize this law in its jurisdiction.”

California has seven immigration detention centers: Adelanto ICE Processing Center and Desert View Annex in San Bernardino County; The Golden State Annex, Mesa Verde ICE Processing facility, and the California City detention facility in Kern County; The Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Imperial County; and the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego County.

ICE pays the for-profit prison company GEO Group to operate four of the centers: Adelanto, Desert View Annex, Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center.

MTC manages the detention center in Imperial County, while CoreCivic manages Otay Mesa and California City.

California has seven immigration detention centers

All of the facilities are located in Southern California: Three in Kern County, two in San Bernardino County, one in Imperial County and one in San Diego County.

The 2024 law gives local health officials the authority to inspect private detention facilities as they deem necessary, but it does not require them to do so unless requested by local lawmakers or law enforcement. And it does not specify exactly what county health inspectors should check, despite lawmakers and cosponsors of the bill citing “detainees facing challenges in accessing timely medical attention” as one of the reasons the new law was necessary.

As the bill moved forward, lawmakers also cited a May 2020 COVID-19 outbreak at the Otay Mesa Detention Center that resulted in more than 300 staff and detained individuals becoming infected. “Conditions in these facilities not only affect the lives of those detained, but also impact the surrounding communities,” wrote the bill’s author, state Sen. María Elena Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles.

It passed without any recorded opposition and with unanimous votes in the Legislature.

GEO Group sued to challenge the law, arguing it was unconstitutional because it stepped on the federal government’s authority to manage detention centers. By extension, GEO claimed intergovernmental immunity as a contractor.

“This case involves the latest in a string of attempts by the State of California to ban federal immigration enforcement in the state, or so significantly burden such efforts as to drive federal agencies and contractors involved in that constitutionally-mandated national security function from California,” GEO attorneys argued in the suit, which was filed in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of California.

In federal court this year, Kern County attorney Jeremy McNutt said county health officer Kristopher Lyon doesn’t want to use the new law to inspect the Mesa Verde and Golden State Annex facilities in his county. McNutt said Lyon would inspect the facility if the governor ordered him to, but otherwise, he “has no intention of inspecting the facility whatsoever.”

“If he’s not ordered to do it then he has no intention of doing it, doesn’t really care to have the right to do it or not,” McNutt said of Lyon. “We don’t believe he has a duty to inspect the facility … There is no commitment or desire to inspect.”

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit in May, letting the law stay in place. Lyon did not respond to a request for comment about whether his position has changed in light of an influx of new detainees and the opening of a new detention center.

Adelanto cleared county review

In the only county making use of its powers to access the detention centers, a San Bernardino County inspector spent about an hour on May 29 at the Adelanto center for food and service issues. The facility passed, according to inspection reports.

San Bernardino County inspector Mary Ann Glass made no notes or comments, and she found no deficiencies or violations at the facility, the paperwork shows.

“Yes, our inspections are limited to food processing and service,” confirmed San Bernardino health department spokesperson Francis Delapaz.

Adelanto is where a 39-year-old detainee was being held shortly before his death in September.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto in August, Ismael Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening and last week escorted him to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. About an hour and a half later, medical staff sent him back to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, where he died.

Adelanto detainees, who spoke with CalMatters on condition that they not be named because they fear retaliation, said the sites are crowded, and it’s taking a long time to access medications and medical care.

An immigrant who was arrested in an ICE raid in Los Angeles in June and spent more than a month at Adelanto, said it took three days for him to be assigned a bed when he arrived at the facility.

During that time, he wasn’t allowed a shower or a change of clothes and wasn’t permitted to call his family. He said the dorm he ultimately slept in doubled in population, to its full capacity of about 90 people. Staff, he said, asked for volunteers to keep the walkways and windows clean, and detainees waited longer than three days to hear back about medical requests.

“Everyone was getting sick with coughs, the flu, with the air being cold all day,” he said. “Almost 50% of the people were like that.”

A Geo Group spokesperson said the company provides around-the-clock access to medical care.

“Geo strongly rejects these baseless allegations,” spokesman Christopher Ferreira said in an email to CalMatters. “Our contracts also set strict limits on a facility’s capacity. Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”

California tried to ban for-profit detention

The federal government’s own inspections indicate allegations of abuse and possible lapses in suicide prevention at the Adelanto facility. In 2024, the Office of Detention Oversight found one detainee who alleged an officer inappropriately squeezed his chest and genitals during a pat-down search, and another told inspectors he had thoughts of self-harming because of the poor conditions inside the facility.

State inspectors released a report in April that documented similar issues with conditions across the state. Staffing shortages, poor coordination between medical and mental health care providers, and widespread problems with record-keeping contributed to the risks for detainees, the report stated.

Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged that state and local oversight over detention facilities is limited, particularly after the state in 2019 attempted to ban private for-profit facilities, a bill Bonta authored as a legislator. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found the law unconstitutional.

Legislators “thought the conditions and practices inside these detention centers were so bad that they should be completely prohibited. And unfortunately, that was struck down,” Bonta told CalMatters.

“Because these are federal detention centers, there is a limit on what I can do, what the California legislature can do. The authority rests more with the federal government, particularly Congress,” he said.",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092225_CalCity-Detention_MV_CM_16-Large.jpeg?fit=1280%2C853,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:29.007606

Australia is awash with political rhetoric about “mass immigration.” Headlines, parliamentary speeches, and public commentary insist the nation is being “flooded” with arrivals. Yet the statistics do not bear this out. Immigration intake numbers fluctuate, but the dominant trend of the past decade has not been runaway growth — it has been the unprecedented expansion of deportations. Under the Migration Act 1958 and specifically its notorious section 501 provisions on “character grounds,” deportations have reached historic highs.

From the turn of the century to 2014, only around 40–60 people per year were deported; today, the figure routinely reaches into the hundreds and at times exceeds 1,000 annually. This is not immigration at all — it is exclusion, expulsion, and destruction of lives.

At the heart of this practice is a policy choice: to allow ideologues and ministers unchecked discretion to brand people – often long-term residents – as unworthy of remaining in the only home they know. These decisions are not about protecting the community from imminent danger. They are about the systematic use of “character” as a weapon, eroding the principle that punishment ends when a sentence is served.

This article examines the legislative framework, the expansion of deportations, the case law that has sought (and often failed) to constrain ministerial power, and the profound human cost. It will highlight the advocacy of myself, and in the past, Julian Burnside, David Manne, George Newhouse and Claire O’Connor and others in exposing this injustice, and argue that Australia’s deportation regime is both unlawful in spirit and inhumane in practice.

Section 501 of the Migration Act: A legislative overview

Section 501 of the Migration Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs (or their delegates) to refuse or cancel a visa if the holder does not pass the “character test.”

The test is notoriously broad. A person fails it if they have:

a substantial criminal record (defined to include a prison sentence of 12 months or more);

an association with a group or person suspected of criminal conduct;

or where the Minister reasonably suspects the person is not of “good character” and cancellation is deemed in the national interest.

What is extraordinary is not only the breadth of these grounds, but the fact that the Minister can personally intervene to cancel visas without affording the usual merits review. This “God power,” as critics call it, creates a zone of unfettered executive authority.

Originally, deportations under s 501 were rare. The section was framed as a safeguard for extraordinary cases. But since 2014, following legislative amendments and political focus on “tough on crime” posturing, it has been weaponised into a routine tool of banishment.

The numbers: From dozens to thousands

The contrast is stark. In 2013, deportations under s 501 numbered fewer than 60. By 2015–16, following policy hardening, deportations surged past 1,000 in a single year. Every year since has seen hundreds expelled. This is not a blip, but a structural shift. Australia is now one of the most aggressive deporting nations in the world relative to population size.

These numbers matter because they undercut the myth of “mass immigration.” Net migration figures are misleading when used in isolation. Yes, people arrive, but thousands are simultaneously being removed — many of whom have lived virtually their entire lives in Australia. Deportation is thus not the management of borders. It is the forced re-drawing of personal lives, the destruction of families, and the destabilisation of communities. Many arrive on short-stay visas, study visas, and when they conclude their stay, they return home.

Deportation as extra-judicial punishment

The legal and moral problem is profound: deportation under s501 punishes people twice.

Take a person convicted of an offence. They are tried by an Australian court, sentenced according to law, serve their time, and are released. That should be the end of the matter. The rule of law requires finality. Yet s501 allows the Minister to impose a further, indefinite penalty – banishment from the community – based on the very conviction that has already been dealt with.

This constitutes an extra-legal punishment, untethered from judicial oversight. As the Federal Court recognised in Moana v Minister for Immigration (2015), cancellation powers under s501 are administrative, not judicial. The effect is quasi-penal, undermining the separation of powers and the integrity of sentencing.

The High Court in Minister for Immigration v Nystrom (2006) upheld the validity of deporting long-term residents, but the dissenting voices warned that the practice flouted basic fairness. Critics argue that it creates a two-tier justice system: citizens who are punished once, and non-citizens who are punished twice.

The ideology of “character”

What does it mean to fail the “character test”? The definition is circular and vague. The Minister may “reasonably suspect” a person is of bad character. But suspicion is not proof, and “bad character” is not a legal offence. It is a political judgment.

The use of character grounds is particularly egregious when applied to those with minor or historical convictions. People who migrated as children, grew up in Australia, and committed offences in youth are stripped of visas despite decades of rehabilitation. This is not about risk management—it is about moral condemnation.

As I have constantly argued, the redeemer principle is at stake: the possibility of redemption is essential for a humane society. If people are forever branded as “bad character,” rehabilitation becomes meaningless. Deportation extinguishes the very possibility of return to community, of repair, of belonging.

Case law and judicial review

Courts have grappled with s 501 cases, but the jurisprudence shows the breadth of ministerial power.

In Hands v Minister for Immigration (2018), the Federal Court found the Minister had failed to properly consider the best interests of children when cancelling a visa.

In Aldous v Minister for Home Affairs (2020), the Court emphasised that decision-makers must engage with international human rights obligations.

Yet in many cases, including Falzon v Minister for Immigration (2018), the High Court upheld broad ministerial discretion.

This patchwork of authority illustrates the limits of legal challenge. While procedural fairness must be observed, the substantive power to deport remains largely intact. It is a system stacked against those facing removal.

The High Court’s decision in Love v Commonwealth (2020) introduced a small but significant limitation. In Love, the Court held that First Nations Australians, as members of political communities with deep and continuing connection to country, cannot be considered “aliens” under s 51(xix) of the Constitution.¹⁵ While the case did not involve deportations under s 501 directly, it highlights the boundaries of the aliens power and underscores that Parliament’s capacity to expel people is not unlimited. More recent Federal Court challenges, such as Tesoriero v Minister for Home Affairs (2021), have tested whether ministerial discretion has been lawfully exercised. Yet, despite scattered victories, the overall trajectory has been judicial deference. The courts have shown reluctance to intrude upon the executive’s claimed prerogative to decide who belongs.

Advocacy and human resistance

Alongside the legal battles stands a history of extraordinary advocacy.

George Newhouse and Claire O’Connor were central in the defence of Cornelia Rau, a stateless German-born Australian resident wrongly detained under migration powers in 2004–05. The case became emblematic of the cruelty and dysfunction of immigration detention, sparking the Palmer and Comrie reports. Their work revealed the dangers of unchecked executive power in migration law, which continue today under s 501 deportations.

David Manne’s work has been similarly vital, particularly through the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre (RILC), where he has defended asylum seekers against refoulement and unlawful detention. Julian Burnside KC has fought landmark refugee cases, from Tampa through to multiple High Court challenges, insisting on the centrality of human dignity and international law.

And in recent years, I have been at the forefront of resisting deportations under s501, averting removals in numerous cases. The successful advocacy in the matters of Robert Taylor and Stephen Pokrywka, both covered in ABC News, revealed how deportation tears apart long-standing Australian residents. In another case, that of Ian Orario, I won a decisive victory in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, securing protection against unjust removal. I have succeeded with 23 individuals from 25, avoiding deportation and in securing their liberty from immigration detention. These interventions underscore how individual resistance can temporarily blunt systemic brutality. Yet they also show the limits: for every victory, hundreds of deportations continue.

Human cost: Families and communities shattered

Behind every statistic is a family torn apart. Deportations often target individuals who arrived in Australia as infants or children, never formalised citizenship, and know no other country. To send them “back” is a misnomer — many have no connection to their birth country, no family there, no language skills, no cultural ties.

Communities lose fathers, mothers, siblings. Children are left behind. The trauma reverberates across generations. Deportation is not just a legal act — it is a social wound.

Advocates such as I, George Newhouse, Claire O’Connor, David Manne, and Julian Burnside have fought tirelessly to stop removals, often succeeding in isolated cases. But systemic reform is needed. Without legislative change, each victory is temporary, each reprieve fragile.

International law and human rights

Australia is a party to numerous international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 12 guarantees the right to liberty of movement, and Article 17 protects against arbitrary interference with family life. Deportations under s 501 regularly breach these obligations.

The UN Human Rights Committee has repeatedly criticised Australia’s deportation practices. It has noted that deportations of long-term residents amount to arbitrary expulsion, especially when individuals have served their criminal sentences.

Australia’s Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) obligations also intersect with deportation policy. Forced removals often involve detention in harsh conditions, raising serious questions about compliance with anti-torture norms.

Political rhetoric versus reality

The fixation on “mass immigration” is a distraction. Politicians gain mileage by stoking fear of influx, yet the reality is that deportations outstrip arrivals in significance for many communities. The narrative is one of control, toughness, and deterrence.

But at what cost? The moral panic about immigration blinds the public to the human rights crisis unfolding in plain sight. Deportations are sold as protection of the community, when in fact they fracture it.

Toward reform: Restoring justice

What is needed is wholesale reform of s501. Options include:

Limiting the character test to serious, ongoing threats, rather than historical convictions.

Restoring judicial oversight, ensuring that deportation decisions are made in courts, not ministerial offices.

Introducing a tenure-based protection: those who have lived in Australia since childhood should not be deported under any circumstances.

Embedding international human rights standards into domestic law, ensuring that family unity and proportionality are central.

The principle of redemption must be restored. A society that denies people the chance to rebuild after mistakes is a society without compassion.

There is no mass immigration in Australia. There is mass deportation. I challenge anyone to sit down with me, face the public record and community reckoning, and we discuss the immigration numbers, disaggregate. The record will demonstrate permanent migration at levels below or as required to continue procuring Australia’s annual double trillionaire economy. However, the record on deportations is a gross disgrace. Record numbers of people – many raised here, many rehabilitated – are being expelled under a draconian interpretation of s501 of the Migration Act. This is extra-judicial punishment, contrary to the rule of law, destructive of families, and corrosive of human dignity.

The rhetoric of “bad character” disguises the truth: deportation is not about safety. It is about exclusion, othering, and political gain. The advocates who resist it – Gerry Georgatos, George Newhouse, Claire O’Connor, David Manne, Julian Burnside – illuminate a better path, one grounded in humanity, legality, and justice.

Australia must confront the truth: a just society does not cast out its most vulnerable. It redeems them.

The Portland Police Bureau arrested two people at the protest for allegedly blocking the street from vehicles passing through. Earlier in the evening, federal law enforcement agents detained an individual after they allegedly stepped onto the ICE facility property.

KOIN 6 News crews were on the scene outside the federal building on South Macadam Avenue, where protests continued, as the threat looms of President Trump deploying Oregon National Guard troops in the coming days.

According to witnesses, a protester had crossed the blue line, indicating they were stepping on federal property, after which about 10 federal law enforcement agents ran after them across the street and tackled the person. The person was then taken behind the gate and into the ICE facility building.

In a separate incident later on in the night, Portland police arrested two people for allegedly blocking neighborhood traffic on South Bancroft Street after giving the crowd multiple warnings to clear the street for traffic, according to the PPB Events Messages X account.

Police said the two were also seen engaging in aggressive behavior towards each other in the street and both were using sound amplification devices. They were booked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on charges of second-degree disorderly conduct. Additionally, one was in possession on a can of bear spray and a collapsible metal coil baton, officials said.

This comes after a tense protest outside the ICE facility took place on Thursday night, in which federal agents deployed pepper balls and pepper-spray at protesters. That same night, three people were arrested, including a prominent right-wing influencer, by the Portland Police Bureau for allegedly getting into physical fights.

Portland Police Association President Sgt. Aaron Schmautz told KOIN 6 News that PPB’s role during protests is very different than that of federal law enforcement agents, noting PPB officers do not engage in the enforcement of immigration laws.

“So, everything that we do, all our entire crowd control response is born out of the events of 2020. Specifically, the DOJ, we have a consent decree. They instructed and informed a lot of that,” Schmautz said.

Portland police now use officers in white shirts, known as community liaison officers.

“We have liaison officers who are specifically assigned to be present to kind of help navigate who might help, but they are also not there specifically to engage or run into or investigate crime.”

PPB also has officers on bikes and others patrolling on foot during protests, though they may not make their presence known. All of this is in the name of keeping the peace, Schmautz said.

“Every single person who puts a uniform on does it with the desire to serve their community. They’re doing their level best. There’s new information and very confounding circumstances. But it is just an incredibly untenable situation,” Schmautz said.

After the individual was arrested by federal agents outside the ICE facility on Friday night, the incident appeared to upset other people at the demonstration. Randall Blazak, a sociologist and part of Cure PNW, is part of a group that comes to the demonstrations every week to teach people de-escalation skills in what can be a highly contentious environment.

“Part of this has been teaching de-escalation skills, giving people skills in the protest movement and as well as with the police to help sort of bring things down when the tensions get high, because people get very emotional,” Blazak said.

On Friday, there were many different groups outside the federal facility, not just anti-ICE protesters. There appeared to be counter-protesters, as there was on Thursday night, as well as different people in media documenting what’s happening, and people from around the state just observing what’s happening.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/10/Federal-agents-arrest-a-protesters-outside-the-Portland-ICE-facility-on-Friday-October-3-2025-KOIN3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:53.594262

Friday’s announcement came after Portland police arrested , Nicholas Sortor, on Thursday night. Authorities accused him of disorderly conduct in connection with a fight outside the ICE building.

Meanwhile, this weekend on a request from Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield for temporary restraining order to block the National Guard deployment. Rayfield argues the deployment is unlawful and unwarranted.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have pushed back on the assertion the National Guard is needed.

The deployment of the National Guard has not yet been seen in Portland.

The crowd outside the ICE facility on Friday night was larger than those seen since Monday.

There were also more conservative protesters at the facility, which led to some confrontations between them and anti-ICE protesters. But otherwise, it was peaceful.

There was also a bigger law enforcement presence in the air and on the ground. Federal officers launched a drone, and a helicopter circled the area.

Portland Police Bureau spokesperson Sgt. Kevin Allen told KATU in an email that the police bureau continues to monitor the protest.

The court on Oct. 3 paused a federal judge's September ruling that the administration hadwrongly ended a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants to live and work temporarily in the United States amid perilous conditions back home.

The high court also sided with the administration at an earlier stage in the case. In May, the justices lifted a California federal judge's temporary order, keeping the program in place while the case is litigated.

In a brief, unsigned order, the court on Oct. 3 said that while the posture of the case has changed, the legal arguments and balance of potential harms to both sides have not.

“The same result that we reached in May is appropriate here,” the court said.

The court’s three liberal justices said they would have rejected the administration’s request.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissenting opinion, called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“Because, re­spectfully, I cannot abide our repeated, gratuitous, and harmful interference with cases pending in the lower courts while lives hang in the balance, I dissent,” she wrote.

Earlier this month, Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his final ruling against the administration. Chen and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put that ruling on hold while the administration appeals it.

The Justice Department said that the lower courts were disregarding the Supreme Court's earlier intervention, a move it called ""indefensible.""

""This Court's orders are binding on litigants and lower courts,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said when asking the court in September to pause the judge’s ruling. ""Whether those orders span one sentence or many pages, disregarding them − as the lower courts did here − is unacceptable.""

The court's May decision did not explain why it let the administration proceed.

""We can only guess as to the Court’s rationale when it provides none,"" the appeals court said when explaining why that ruling did not control the outcome at this stage of the litigation.

In addition, the appeals judges said the courts nowhave more evidence to consider, including that the Department of Homeland Security had run a ""barebones process"" when it ended the program with ""unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner.""

“This case is about whether a federal agency acted outside the scope of its delegated authority and contrary to the procedures Congress required it to follow,” lawyers for the advocacy group and the Venezuelans challenging the administration’s actions told the Supreme Court.

The lawyers also said the court should let the appeals process play out before intervening since the justices didn’t get involved during the Biden administration when a judge temporarily halted some of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.

""Our presence here is not an emergency, no matter what the government says,"" said one of the Venezuelans, identified as M.H., who is married to a U.S. citizen and has two children.

In February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered an end to the program called Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans. She concluded that the immigrants burden local governments and said some Venezuelans were members of the gang Tren de Aragua, which President Donald Trump has declared a foreign terrorist organization.

The advocacy group National TPS Alliance and a handful of Venezuelans sued, arguing it’s not safe for them to return to their home country.

When the Supreme Court, in May, allowed the administration to end deportation protections temporarily, thousands of families were torn apart, lawyers for the National TPS Alliance told the Supreme Court in September.

We vehemently disagree with those who take a hard line on deporting undocumented immigrants, but it’s not an unreasonable position.","The Trump White House has a simple — and dishonest — explanation for why the government is shut down: Democrats are demanding free health care for undocumented immigrants.

Senate Democrats have “shut down the government,” said Vice President JD Vance during a White House briefing on Thursday, “because we won’t give billions of dollars to health care funding for illegal aliens.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson put out a statement with the wordy title, “Democrats are Choosing Health Care for Illegal Aliens over American Troop Pay, Nutritional Assistance for Women, Infants, and Children.”

In a bizarre and bigoted AI video posted on Trump’s X and Truth Social feeds — and since boosted by the White House’s X account — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is shown wearing a sombrero and a mustache. Next to him is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who, in a fake voice, says everyone hates Democrats and that’s why the party wants to give undocumented immigrants free health care, so “they can vote for us.”

Of course, none of this is true. But it’s par for the course with this White House.

Since Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has employed one dehumanizing and racist attack after another against undocumented immigrants. They have called immigrants an invading force, depicted them as bloodthirsty criminals and described them in terms that cross the line into dehumanization.

As Johnson and Vance are undoubtedly aware, undocumented immigrants cannot purchase federal health insurance plans. They’re not eligible for Medicaid, and they are prohibited from purchasing subsidized health care coverage via Obamacare.

In reality, Democrats are pushing to extend Obamacare tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year and also roll back Medicaid cuts that were included in the Republican tax cut bill, enacted in July. But not only has the White House continued to make these false claims, Vance’s comments on Thursday went a step further, far beyond the pale.

According to Vance, “If you’re an American citizen and you’ve been to the hospital in the last few years, you’ve probably noticed that wait times are especially large and very often somebody who’s there in the ER is an illegal alien. Why do those people get health care benefits at hospitals paid for by American citizens?”

Most Americans could answer this question rather easily.

Denying emergency care to someone with a life-threatening condition, simply because they are an “illegal alien” — or for any reason — is morally abhorrent.

Vance also ridiculed Democratic claims that they aren’t looking to cover undocumented immigrants by pointing to a program in New York state to allow undocumented immigrants over the age of 65 to purchase health insurance. Never mind that this is a program paid for with state, not federal dollars, but what kind of a person — particularly one who calls themselves a pro-life Catholic — opposes letting senior citizens buy health insurance?

Vance is not alone in his inhumanity. When asked if emergency rooms should check immigration status before treating a dying patient, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “That’s a question for health care professionals and legal experts to answer.”

To be clear, there is a very specific legal answer — and quite obvious moral response — to the question posed to Leavitt.

Hospitals are required by law to provide lifesaving care to anyone who enters an emergency room. It’s a provision of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which was signed into law by the original “Make America Great Again” Republican president, Ronald Reagan, in 1986.

The Medicaid program reimburses hospitals that provide emergency care. This is not health care coverage for “illegal aliens.” Instead, it is meant to defray the costs of providing care for anyone who enters the ER, whether they are undocumented migrants or Americans without health insurance.

But forget the law. Leavitt also calls herself a devout Catholic and often leads the White House press team in a daily prayer. The key constituency of Donald Trump is evangelical, “pro-life” Christians. One might expect both to support the preservation of life above all else. But as is so often the case with those who work for this White House — and many who support it — crude, cynical and heartless politics trumps all else.

You don’t have to take my word for it.

Consider, for example, the words of Pope Leo XIV. Earlier this week, he was asked about the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago’s decision to present a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin (Pope Leo is originally from Illinois). The Archdiocese’s move has sparked controversy because Durbin supports abortion rights and, of course, the Catholic Church is adamantly opposed to abortion.

According to Leo, “Someone who says ‘I’m against abortion’ but says ‘I’m in favor of the death penalty’ is not really pro-life. So, someone who says that ‘I’m against abortion, but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”

Imagine if someone asked Leo about the pro-life bona fides of someone who questions providing potentially lifesaving health care.

Not surprisingly, Leavitt pushed back on the pope’s comments, saying she rejects the idea that “illegal immigrants” are receiving “inhumane treatment … under this administration.” But when members of the Trump administration are complaining that “illegal aliens” are receiving lifesaving emergency care or using the bogeyman of undocumented immigrants receiving health care coverage as a cynical political talking point, the inhumanity is evident to all.

Americans do not see eye to eye on immigration. Plenty of Americans share my view that immigration — even illegal immigration — is a net positive for America, both economically and culturally. We vehemently disagree with those who take a hard line on deporting undocumented immigrants, but it’s not an unreasonable position. One can look at the same issue and fail to see eye to eye.

But what shouldn’t be in disagreement is that the millions of undocumented migrants who reside in the United States deserve a modicum of respect and basic humanity. They are not less human simply because of their legal status.

However, that is precisely the position taken by the Trump administration and its supporters. The repeated dehumanization of undocumented immigrants, which has become so routine that it is hardly even remarkable anymore, is a stain not just on the White House but on America. We can and should be better than this.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CtyQiWmmlOEclsNJaYcDkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/b6955d7c9cf569a49f8ea667ec16594e,N,,2025-10-04 16:58:33.407930

The Department of Homeland Security has begun targeting unaccompanied children in the immigration system with what they call a “voluntary option” to return to their countries of origin. Lawyers told LAist they are deeply concerned the program will result in children waiving their rights to see an immigration judge before being removed from the country.

What we know so far: Unverified reports spread through social media and immigration rights advocate circles Thursday suggested ICE was planning to offer unaccompanied children in the immigration system 14 years and older $2,500 in return for waiving their rights to see an immigration judge.

A spokesperson for DHS acknowledged the new program in a social media post today.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” the DHS account wrote, also referencing an option for “access to financial support when returning home.”

What lawyers are saying:

“[The offer is] problematic because they are giving up their opportunity to be before a judge,” said Yasmin Yavar, deputy director for the American Bar Association’s Children’s Immigration Law Academy. Yavar added that children may not understand the consequences of that choice.

Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, legal services director at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told LAist in an emailed statement that they represent hundreds of unaccompanied children and that the $2,500 incentive “has the potential to exploit their unique vulnerabilities as unaccompanied minors in government custody.”

The Department of Homeland Security has begun targeting unaccompanied children in the immigration system with what they call a “voluntary option” to return to their countries of origin.

Lawyers representing children who entered the country apart from their immediate family have told LAist they are deeply concerned about the program because it appears children will be asked to waive their rights to see an immigration judge before being removed from the country.

This effort by DHS comes after the department attempted earlier this year to stop funding a program to provide legal support to children in the immigration system. All funding to the program was halted in March but ordered by District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín to resume in April in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and federal policies. Last month, 76 undocumented minors were nearly flown to Guatemala in the middle of the night, before the deportations were stopped by District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.

Representatives for DHS and HHS have not immediately responded to LAist’s requests for comment.

What we know so far

Unverified reports spread through social media and immigration rights advocate circles Thursday, citing supposedly leaked information about an Immigration and Customs Enforcement action called “Operation Freaky Friday” set to begin today.

The reports suggested ICE was planning to send “offer” letters to unaccompanied children in the immigration system 14 years and older, where they would be promised $2,500 in return for waiving their rights to see an immigration judge.

It was also claimed that if children refused the offer they would be detained upon turning 18 and their family members living in the U.S. would also be arrested. Plans to threaten detention or arrest have not been independently verified by LAist.

In a social media post today, a spokesperson for DHS denied the name of the operation, saying that it was made up by “anti-ICE activists,” but acknowledged that there is now a program in place that is similar in some regard to what was shared in the unverified reports.

“ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” the DHS account wrote, also referencing an option for “access to financial support when returning home.”

Unaccompanied children are required to be transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee and Resettlement, known as ORR, shortly after they are detained by DHS according to a legal settlement made by the federal government in 1997.

In an email from HHS to legal service providers that was shared with LAist, HHS confirmed that DHS will provide $2,500 to undocumented children 14 years or older who take the offer, excluding minors from Mexico or those who have left their custody.

What lawyers are saying

Yasmin Yavar, deputy director for the American Bar Association’s Children’s Immigration Law Academy, told LAist that children who take this offer could end up waiving their rights.

“[The offer is] problematic because they are giving up their opportunity to be before a judge,” Yavar said, adding that children may not understand the consequences of that choice.

Yavar said that children who are detained and in the custody of ORR are supposed to get a “Know your Rights” presentation and be able to consult with an attorney to provide information about their rights and responsibilities.

Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, legal services director at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told LAist in an emailed statement that they represent hundreds of unaccompanied children and that the $2,500 incentive “has the potential to exploit their unique vulnerabilities as unaccompanied minors in government custody.”

The DHS social media post defended the move saying many unaccompanied children had no choice in coming to the U.S. and would be returning to family outside the country.

Multiple lawyers who spoke to LAist said that unaccompanied children commonly live with family in the U.S., and that federal regulations direct ORR to prioritize releasing children to parents or immediate family members in the country while they go through immigration court.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville, Tennessee, cited statements administration officials made celebrating the charges brought against Abrego as evidence the indictment may have been pursued in retaliation for a lawsuit he brought in Maryland challenging his wrongful deportation.

Crenshaw pointed to “remarkable statements” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche made on Fox News that prosecutors started investigating Abrego after a judge in Maryland questioned his removal and found the government “had no right to deport him.”

Blanche during the June 6 interview said Abrego was not returned to the United States “for any other reason than to face justice.”

Crenshaw said those statements could directly establish that the motivations for Abrego’s charges stem from the exercise of his rights to bring suit against the administration over his deportation, “rather than a genuine desire to prosecute him for alleged criminal misconduct.”

Federal law allows for the dismissal of criminal charges if a judge determines they were brought to punish someone for exercising their due process rights. Such requests rarely succeed.

But Crenshaw, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, said Abrego had carried his burden of showing he was likely vindictively prosecuted. He said Abrego was entitled to obtain further evidence from the government and have a hearing to decide whether the case should be dismissed.

Representatives for Abrego and the Justice Department declined to comment.

Abrego, a native of El Salvador who had been living in Maryland, was deported and imprisoned in El Salvador in March despite a 2019 judicial ruling that he could not be sent there because of a risk of gang persecution.

Abrego challenged that deportation in a civil lawsuit before a federal judge in Maryland. The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld an order from the Maryland judge that the Trump administration facilitate Abrego’s return.

In June, Abrego was returned to the U.S. after prosecutors secured an indictment in Tennessee accusing him of transporting migrants in the U.S. illegally as part of a smuggling ring. Abrego has pleaded not guilty and has disputed that he was a gang member.

The most contested is known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S.

The latest volley at the decades-old program came late Friday, when in a brief, unsigned order, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the government to lift the form of protection for Venezuelan immigrants, ultimately leaving some 600,000 people at risk of deportation by November.

The T.P.S. program allows foreign nationals to stay in the U.S. for about 18 months when circumstances such as natural disasters or armed conflict make returning to their home countries unsafe. But the initiative has become all but permanent for people from some nations that have continued to be unstable for many years, such as Haiti and until recently, Syria.

Critics of the program such as Mr. Trump say that has made it ripe for exploitation. But immigrant and refugee advocates say that this form of immigration relief has become one of the few paths to safety for people in an outdated and overburdened immigration system that Congress has failed to adapt to the modern challenges of global migration.

Now, a wave of litigation from coast to coast has plunged hundreds of thousands of people — as well as their employers and families — into uncertainty over whether they can maintain the work permits and deportation protections under the program and for how long. Some have already been fired, held in detention or deported. Others are worried they will be abruptly expelled and forced to return to the dangerous homelands they had fled.

Which Countries Have T.P.S. Right Now?

This year, the Trump administration has taken steps to eliminate the program for more than one million people from eight nations: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela. But immigrant and civil rights groups have filed six lawsuits across the country in attempts to stave off most of those actions. Plaintiffs from Haiti have won relief in the courts and remain protected for now. The Supreme Court emergency decision immediately ended the protections for 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2023, leaving them at risk of deportation. The program will expire for an additional 250,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2021 on Nov. 7.

For nine other countries, including El Salvador and Ukraine, the Trump administration has left T.P.S. in place. But those protections are scheduled to begin expiring as early as next month.

In two other cases, federal appeals courts have allowed federal officials to terminate the program for some 80,000 people, mostly from Honduras.

Syrians became the latest group facing the loss of protections in September. That same month President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria appeared before the United Nations General Assembly to paint a new picture of his country after an offensive he led last year toppled the dictator Bashar al-Assad and ended a 13-year civil war. The T.P.S. program will expire for 4,000 people at the end of November, after which they can be deported.

Even favorable rulings for Haitians and Venezuelans would leave their status, along with that of hundreds of thousands of others, unsettled: The National TPS Alliance and the Haitian Evangelical Clergy Association, two advocacy organizations that have filed suits, are continuing their litigation to preserve the protections for both groups. The National TPS Alliance is also preparing to contest the termination of T.P.S. for people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal in November. And the U.S. government has indicated it plans to issue a new directive on Haitian protections by December.

Why does the Trump administration want to end the program?

Mr. Trump has long targeted T.P.S. The form of legal protection, passed with bipartisan support by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was created to aid people experiencing humanitarian emergencies.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration tried to end T.P.S. for more than 400,000 people, saying that conditions in some countries had improved and that the initiatives did not align with its efforts to tighten the nation’s borders. But the attempts to end the program were successfully challenged in court by the National TPS Alliance and other organizations.

President Biden later went on to expand T.P.S. protections and create new temporary humanitarian programs as his administration struggled to process record levels of migrants arriving at the southern border.

Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has tried to dismantle those Biden-era initiatives, claiming migrants who have entered through the programs are abusing the protections and have not been properly vetted. Now, as in Mr. Trump’s first term, immigrant and civil rights groups are challenging the administration’s actions, arguing that federal officials have violated administrative procedures and acted with racial bias in revoking the program.

In March, Judge Edward M. Chen of the Federal District Court in San Francisco prevented the administration from ending T.P.S. for Venezuelans and Haitians while their legal challenge moved forward. Mr. Chen cited discriminatory statements made by Mr. Trump and his homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, against Venezuelans as evidence that racial animus could have been a factor. He also said termination of the program for hundreds of thousands of people would inflict irreparable harm on families, cost U.S. businesses and industries billions in economic activity and hurt the health and safety of communities.

But in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to temporarily pause the program. Throughout the summer, the fate of Venezuelans and Haitians was in flux, until Judge Chen issued a final ruling in September to restore the protections. The Ninth Circuit upheld that decision, after which point the government asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.

What has been the impact?

The back-and-forth in the courts has created a fraught environment for T.P.S. holders. Many have been applying for asylum, work visas or other forms of legal relief. But the pathways to legal residency are slim, and petitions can take years to process.

After days of stress and deliberation, Rita, a labor delivery nurse in Texas whose T.P.S. expired in August, decided to return to her native Nepal. But she had to cancel her flight hours before her departure as violent political protests erupted in Kathmandu, the capital, shutting down international airports. Dozens were killed, and government offices and Parliament buildings were left scorched.

Rita, a plaintiff in the National TPS Alliance who asked that her last name be withheld for security reasons in Nepal, said she is now waiting to receive work authorization in Canada and trying not to feel “trapped.” “There has been no stable day,” she said.

Jhony Silva, another plaintiff in the case who was born in Honduras and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he had been protected under the T.P.S. program since he was 3 years old, when he and his mother fled the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. His parents have since been able to acquire legal residency through his sibling, but he has been stuck in legal limbo.

He has lost his position as a nursing assistant at Stanford University and is relying on community support to get by. But he said he cannot leave his 9-year-old child, nor the United States, the only country he has ever really known.

So far, Wisconsin has not been targeted for the massive escalation in immigration raids taking place in neighboring states.
And some communities that have been tempted to accept federal dollars and cooperate with ICE have begun to think twice.
In Palmyra, where the local police department signed an agreement with ICE, community pushback has slowed down implementation of the agreement.","A family friend who lives in Mexico flew into Chicago last week to visit his college-aged son. We exchanged messages about getting together. Could the two of them come up to Madison, I asked. “The truth is with everything that’s been happening in Chicago, and the arbitrary arrests, we almost haven’t gone out at all these last three days,” my friend wrote back. “This stuff with ICE, it’s unbelievable,” he added. “But there it is. It’s happening.”

Sadly, he felt safer staying in his son’s apartment and then dashing to the airport Saturday to fly back to Mexico than driving across the border to visit us in Wisconsin.

The same day we exchanged messages, an ICE raid on the northeast side of Madison, not far from my home, swept up seven people. Madison police didn’t even know about the ICE raid until it was over, according to chief John Patterson.

So far, Wisconsin has not been targeted for the massive escalation in immigration raids taking place in neighboring states. But the Thursday morning arrests in Madison and a Sept. 25 sweep of dairy farm workers in Manitowoc mark a sudden shift.

Darryl Morin of the nonprofit Forward Latino addressed the Madison and Manitowoc raids at a Friday press conference in Milwaukee. “While other states such as California and Illinois have borne the brunt of these new immigration enforcement actions,” he said, “I fear we are turning the page and entering a new chapter, a new sad chapter, in immigration enforcement right here in our great state.”

“What we’re seeing in Chicago is now starting to hit closer to home,” agreed Jennifer Maldonado, an immigrants’ rights advocate in Manitowoc, who joined the press conference by video link. She described fielding calls from terrified family members after the crackdown in her area. “Many are people asking, ‘Should I send my children to school? Should I go to work?’” she said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims it disrupted an international sex and drug trafficking ring when it grabbed the 24 Manitowoc farm workers at a Walmart parking lot and in a door-to-door operation targeting workers’ homes.

But this is the same Department of Homeland Security that insisted a Mexican-born Milwaukee resident wrote a letter threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump — even after the person who actually wrote the letter, Demetric Scott, admitted that he was the real author and that he was trying to frame the other man to keep him from testifying against Scott at trial. Long after that confession a statement from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem celebrating the detention of “this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump” remained on the DHS website, uncorrected, connecting the wrong person to an image of the letter written by Scott.

Dubious hype about immigrant workers, portraying them as dangerous, violent criminals, is the now-familiar backdrop to a crackdown that does not, in fact, have anything to do with fighting crime. Fewer than half of the people ICE has arrested under Trump are convicted criminals. Of those, only 7% have been convicted of violent crimes and only 5% of drug-related crimes, Tim Henderson of Stateline reports.

In Manitowoc, “This [criminal network] narrative was pushed without any basis to try to paint a negative image of an entire community,” Christine Neumann-Ortiz of Voces de la Frontera said during the Friday press conference. Of the 24 people arrested, ICE identified one person who faced serious criminal charges. But, as Henry Redman reported, that person was not among those rounded up and was already sitting in custody during the Sept. 25 raid.

Neumann-Ortiz described seeing disturbing videos documenting ICE actions — agents barging into a home “as if this were some kind of cartel, when it’s a working class family” and of a father who was grabbed by ICE while taking out the garbage. “It’s disturbing. It’s very, very disturbing,” she said.

One bright spot, she said, has been the community response to “the tragedy that we’re witnessing around the U.S. and here in Wisconsin as well.” She praised Wisconsinites’ sense of “urgency to build community — to support each other.”

Voces and other groups have been training community members across the state, with Know Your Rights seminars and instruction on how to effectively document ICE activity without escalating a dangerous situation. They’ve been lobbying local communities to reject 287(g) ICE cooperation agreements along with the cash incentives the federal government is offering local law enforcement in exchange for rounding up immigrants — a system Neumann Ortiz described as allowing local police to “essentially function like bounty hunters.” And they’ve been trying to help immigrants prepare for the worst, connecting them with immigration attorneys and helping them make contingency plans by naming caretakers for their property and guardians for their children in case they are deported. Forward Latino is sharing helpful information in a “family separation toolkit.”

Advocates, Neumann-Ortiz said, are getting good at “combatting lies,” connecting immigrants with legal support, and moving fast.

Several Manitowoc workers have already been deported, she said, and another was moved to detention outside of Wisconsin, where it’s hard for his family members and his lawyers to be in touch with him.

Morin said he was on the phone with a Wisconsin resident who had been detained by ICE and he could hear an agent yelling in the background that the man had to sign a self-deportation order. Morin was also yelling, telling the man not to sign, and that they had to let him see a lawyer. “That’s happening on a daily basis,” Morin said. “The violation of constitutional rights is happening right now on a daily basis.”

Against a gale of misinformation, immigrants’ advocates are fighting to get out the truth.

“You can fight your deportation. But people need to know that and not be tricked or conned into signing deportation orders,” Neumann Ortiz said.

“It’s not a crime to be undocumented in the US. It’s a civil violation,” Morino added.

Farmers, alarmed at the prospect of losing the immigrant workers who perform 70% of the labor on Wisconsin dairy farms, have been communicating with each other and with immigrants rights groups, Neumann-Ortiz said, trying to help their employees protect themselves.

“We need to scale it up even more, so that people are not tricked into giving up their rights,” she said.

The federal immigration crackdown, and the way it has seeped into local communities, does nothing to improve public safety. We are all safer if immigrants are confident enough to call 911 to report crime and abuse “or if their neighbor’s house is on fire,” as Morin put it.

Despite the dire news, advocates see progress in community engagement and responsiveness.

“In the early days we were getting flooded with false reports,” Morin said. “People wanted to spread fear.” Now, through training and preparation, advocacy groups have created a reliable channel for information about ICE raids and are able to screen out unsubstantiated rumors.

And some communities that have been tempted to accept federal dollars and cooperate with ICE have begun to think twice.

In Palmyra, where the local police department signed an agreement with ICE, community pushback has slowed down implementation of the agreement. In Walworth County, Neumann-Ortiz said, public pressure helped persuade the sheriff to reject a 287(g) agreement and Ozaukee County rolled back an agreement to accept federal money in exchange for detaining immigrants arrested by ICE.

The massive increase in funding for ICE — and the incentives it offers local law enforcement agencies to pursue immigrants in their communities — is funded through the same “Big Beautiful Bill Act” that slashes health care, food assistance and education funding. “We’re taking away food from hungry kids, medical care, money from schools, to do what?” Neumann-Ortiz said, referring to the push to terrorize immigrants. “That does not promote public safety.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dsc05045_51265400144_o-2048x1365.png,N,,2025-10-04 16:59:16.107868

It’s unclear how many people, exactly, have been detained by ICE agents at the Fresno USCIS office, and whether federal officers are targeting green card applicants with prior arrests.

ICE agents also detained another man in July during a scheduled appointment at the Fresno USCIS office.","ICE agents have recently detained individuals applying for green cards at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office in downtown Fresno, according to local immigration attorneys.

Until recently, attorneys said it was rare for people to be detained during routine green card appointments at the USCIS office.

USCIS is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees lawful immigration to the United States and processes applications for citizenship, permanent residency, asylum, work permits and other immigration benefits.

Jeremy Clason, an immigration attorney in Fresno, said a client of his who is married to a U.S. citizen was detained during his green card interview in July at the USCIS office in Fresno.

“From 2005 up until when this particular client was detained, I had only had one other client ever detained at a USCIS office in 20 years of practice,” he said.

It’s unclear how many people, exactly, have been detained by ICE agents at the Fresno USCIS office, and whether federal officers are targeting green card applicants with prior arrests. But immigration attorneys said the recent detainments may deter some people from applying for a green card.

Clason said he suspects USCIS coordinated with ICE agents to detain his client, because his client’s wife was asked to remain in the lobby during the green card interview.

“This interview was very strange. I could tell from the beginning that the officer didn’t really want to ask the questions that she needed to ask him to determine whether he was eligible to become a green card holder,” Clason said.

Clason said that the ICE agents didn’t provide a reason for detaining his client, though he suspects his client’s past criminal history was a factor.

“He was never convicted for any criminal offenses. They detained him purely on arrests that didn’t result in convictions,” he said. “They didn’t even give him a chance to explain the details of those two arrests.”

Clason said his client was sent to a McFarland detention facility in late July, and immediately filed a request for a bond hearing. An immigration court judge ultimately granted his client’s release on a $10,000 bond in August.

Clason said his client was likely able to secure release on bond because he entered the country legally on a student visa, is married to a U.S. citizen and thus has a legal path to remain in the U.S., and has never been convicted of any crimes.

ICE agents also detained another man in July during a scheduled appointment at the Fresno USCIS office.

Fresno attorney George Rios said his client arrived at his green card interview with his wife, a U.S. citizen, but she was asked to step into the waiting area before ICE agents arrived and detained him.

“The position that ICE has officially taken regarding his detention is that they believe he entered the country unlawfully,” Rios said. “I believe the real reason they detained him is because of his criminal history. In my opinion, he is eligible for his green card because of the way he entered. He was a child, driven across the border at the age of four, and presented himself to immigration officials, which counts as a legal entry.”

Rios’s client is currently detained at a detention facility in McFarland.

Rios said he will need to prove several requirements at a hearing this month to give his client a chance to stay in the country. He said his client has been in the U.S. for at least 10 years, maintained good moral character during that time, and has no criminal convictions.

Rios said his client’s deportation would cause extreme hardship on his wife, a U.S. citizen, and children, the youngest of whom is less than a year old.

Clason, the Fresno attorney, said that, given the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, other people who have filed for their green cards may risk detainment at USCIS appointments.

Clason said a recent immigration decision, known as Matter of Yajure Hurtado, which holds that anyone who entered the U.S. unlawfully — regardless of how long ago — is subject to mandatory detention with no bond, will mean many people will face their cases while detained.

“Many more immigrants are going to be detained at the Fresno field office,” he said. “I think what’s discouraging from my perspective, the people being detained right now, filed applications last year, relying on USCIS’s policies last year.”

Whenever clients get interviews for their green cards now, Clason explains to them the risks and in some cases recommends that they wait to get their green cards until the Trump administration is out of office.

“Clients are becoming more apprehensive of attending interviews or filing in the first place because the chances of them getting detained are now much higher,” Clason said.

MPD posted this update on its website Friday:

“The Madison Police Department was not made aware of the presence of ICE officials in Madison yesterday until after their enforcement action was complete, and after they were already gone from our community. We were made aware of their possible presence by trusted community partners, and we were later able to confirm it by contacting federal partners. The Madison Police Department works closely with our community partners to ensure that we are doing everything that we can to aid in effective communication and ease concerns for the entire community.”

Centro Dane County, which advocates for immigrants, said seven people were arrested by those ICE agents on the northeast side of Madison Thursday. Spectrum News is trying to confirm more details.

Meanwhile, the FBI in Milwaukee shared this on social media on Sept. 25:

“Today, FBI Milwaukee and Immigration And Customs Enforcement (ICE) led a joint operation with the assistance of the U.S. Marshals, DEA, CBP, IRS-CI in arresting 21 subjects in Manitowoc County. All the subjects are in the country illegally. Nine of the subjects were targeted for their suspected involvement in the sexual assault and/or trafficking of minor American girls. FBI Milwaukee and our law enforcement partners are dedicated and focused on protecting and safeguarding our Wisconsin communities every day.”

However, the FBI has provided no evidence of their claim that nine of those people who were detained were believed to be involved in the sexual assault and/or trafficking of minor American girls. Immigration advocates in Manitowoc County dispute those claims and say many were dairy workers.

All of this comes as the Milwaukee Business Journal reported that ICE is looking to lease a large office space in downtown Milwaukee for immigration enforcement activities.

On Friday, some Milwaukee aldermen, faith leaders, advocates and organizations working to protect immigrant rights, gathered at Milwaukee City Hall to talk about ICE activity in Wisconsin.

Voces de la Frontera and Forward Latino are among the groups working to track ICE activity and help families.

“We are trying to document everything that’s happening for potential litigation and connect with families to try to meet their needs, like we are doing in Madison and Manitowoc right now to connect the people affected to legal services,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, the executive director of Voces de la Frontera. “It is traumatic for families and communities.”

They are also hosting seminars and trainings to make sure people know their basic rights, like you do not have to open the door to your house unless agents have an order signed by a judge. You have the right to remain silent and ask for an attorney, and you do not have to sign any documents you don’t understand.

“The overwhelming number of undocumented immigrants who have been detained or deported have no criminal record,” said Darryl Morin, the president of Forward Latino.

Trump allocated $250 million for voluntary deportations

Under US federal law, migrant children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian are classified as unaccompanied and placed in federal shelters until they can be released to a relative or foster care.

The process will start with 17-year-olds, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official, but will not include minors from Mexico.

""Any payment to support a return home would be provided after an immigration judge grants the request and the individual arrives in their country of origin,"" ICE said in a statement.

""Access to financial support when returning home would assist should they choose that option.""

Under President Donald Trump, $250 million was allocated to DHS in June by the State Department for voluntary deportations, with migrants being offered $1,000 to self-deport.

Critics decry 'cruel tactics'

Rights advocates have criticized the program.

Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, told Reuters news agency that it is ""a cruel tactic"" which undermines protections for children fleeing violence.

Melissa Adamson of the National Center for Youth Law told AP news agency that $2,500 ""might be the most money they've ever seen,"" making it hard for children to assess the long-term risks of voluntary deportation versus staying in the US.

Meanwhile, the administration's efforts to speed deportations have faced legal pushback. A federal judge recently barred the removal of Guatemalan minors with pending immigration cases.

As of Thursday, more than 2,100 unaccompanied children were in federal custody, according to HHS. Since 2019, more than 600,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed the US-Mexico border, government data shows.

After the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2012 ended removal proceedings against him, he obtained work authorization.","The United States deported a Georgia-based journalist to his native El Salvador, months after his arrest while streaming a protest.

Mario Guevara, 48, boarded a flight around 4 a.m. on Oct. 3. A federal appeals court earlier in the week denied his request to stop his removal, allowing his deportation to take place despite concerns raised by human rights, free speech and press freedom advocates.

In El Salvador, Guevara, an Emmy Award-winning journalist, emerged out of a Salvadoran Border Patrol truck along a roadway. Press flanked him as he returned to the country he left more than two decades ago.

“It’s not how I wanted to return to my country, but here I am,” he said, wiping away tears. His news outlet, MG News, was on scene streaming to tens of thousands of people on his Facebook page. A reporter immediately handed him a microphone.

“Am I live?” he asked, before taking questions from other reporters about his detention and deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to email requests for comment.

Guevara’s deportation has drawn scrutiny of threats to press freedoms in the United States during President Donald Trump's second term.

“Mario Guevara’s deportation is a troubling sign of the deteriorating freedom of the press under the Trump administration,” said Katherine Jacobsen, the North America program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, in a statement.

In a statement, Paul O'Brien, executive director of the human rights organization Amnesty International USA, called Guevara's deportation a “grave injustice and yet another attack by the Trump Administration on human rights, including press freedom, arbitrary detention, and the rule of law.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson previously told USA TODAY in a statement that Guevara's case had ""absolutely nothing to do with the First Amendment and any suggestion otherwise is laughable.""

""The Trump Administration will continue enforcing the law without apology,"" she said.

Arrested covering a protest

In June, Georgia police arrested Guevara while he covered a “No Kings” anti-Trump protest in metropolitan Atlanta, wearing a press vest and streaming on his phone.

Local law enforcement dropped all criminal charges against Guevara. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continued to hold him in custody as they began removal proceedings, saying he was in the country illegally and subject to removal.

The federal Board of Immigration Appeals allowed Guevara’s imminent removal based in part on Guevara not paying an immigration bond in 2012. Guevara’s lawyers, including the ACLU, disputed this, providing an ICE receipt showing he made a $500 bond payment as requested before ICE later cancelled the bond in 2015.

On Oct. 1, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, denied his motion to stay his removal, though it affirmed all people within the United States, regardless of immigration status, are guaranteed “the rights to free speech, free assembly, and free press,” even if they are noncitizen immigrants.

Guevara entered the country on a visitor visa in 2004. His wife and children live in the United States, and his lawyers said he originally fled El Salvador after receiving death threats for his work as a journalist at a conservative newspaper.

After the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2012 ended removal proceedings against him, he obtained work authorization. He recently applied for a green card through his adult son, an American citizen, his lawyers said. However, federal appeals judges determined he could be deported since he didn't properly file to adjust his status in the country.

Guevara said he was treated as a criminal in detention because of his work as a journalist covering the country's immigration crackdown.

As thunder roared in El Salvador, he said he planned to continue reporting, including on migrants he met in detention. When Salvadoran authorities received him earlier in the day, he said more than a hundred others were also deported with him, many of them crying.

“There are a lot of human stories, mine isn’t the only one,” he said.

Guevara hoped to one day return the United States. He called it his second ""patria,"" or homeland, where his children are.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/25/USAT/86348058007-img-5827-2.jpg?crop=4283,2410,x0,y1142&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-04 11:59:13.455922

Rather than come into compliance with Title IX, FCPS chose to sue the federal government and has been unsuccessful in its efforts, both in the Eastern District of Virginia and in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.","Today, America First Legal (AFL) re-filed its case in federal court against the Fairfax County School Board on behalf of Jane Doe, a recent Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) student, challenging policies that compel student speech on gender ideology and deny girls equal access to female-only facilities. In addition to asserting violations of the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Virginia Constitution, the new filing adds claims of Title IX discrimination.

AFL’s complaint details how Fairfax County forced Jane Doe to forgo her religious views and affirm beliefs she does not hold. Doe, and all her peers, are required to use other students’ “preferred pronouns” as mandated by FCPS’s “Student Rights & Responsibilities” (SR&R) guide. The guide also details punishments for students who do not comply, and requires parental signature and acknowledgement. Under the perceived protection of its SR&R guide, FCPS has continuously narrowed girls’ access to common facilities by allowing males to use restrooms and locker rooms based on their “gender identity” and subjective comfort, while forcing girls who object to find uncommon, private alternatives.

This case is about the rule of law and basic fairness. FCPS defends free speech and demands special accommodations for students who align with its radical ideology, but tramples the constitutional rights of those who dissent. Public schools cannot force children to echo contested ideology or sacrifice their privacy to satisfy leftist bureaucrats.

AFL’s new claims of discrimination under Title IX strike at the core inequality: FCPS gave male students safe, male-only restrooms but denied female students safe, female-only restrooms. In Jane Doe’s case, a male classmate was permitted to use the girls’ restroom because he said he felt unsafe in the boys’—but Jane, who felt unsafe and uncomfortable due to the male’s presence, was told to get over it or use a private facility. By allowing a male student to use girls’ restrooms while directing girls to uncommon alternatives, FCPS chose to treat a male more favorably than a female in the use of a female-only private facility—precisely what Title IX forbids.

Relatedly, in July of this year, the United States Department of Education determined that FCPS’s bathroom and locker room policies violate Title IX. Rather than come into compliance with Title IX, FCPS chose to sue the federal government and has been unsuccessful in its efforts, both in the Eastern District of Virginia and in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

“The law could not be more clear: schools cannot compel speech, cannot trample religious liberty, and cannot sacrifice girls’ equal protection rights in the name of a vague and arbitrary ideology that Fairfax County Public Schools can’t even define with any reasonable clarity,” said Ian Prior, Senior Counsel for AFL. “This case is about restoring sanity, fairness, and the constitutional rights every student deserves.”

“The School Board’s policies are untenable,” said Andrew Block, Senior Counsel for AFL. “We’re in federal court to vindicate our client’s rights and to make clear that the law—not gender ideology—governs in public schools.”

Ald. Jessie Fuentes said she was at Humboldt Park Health Friday, after there was a report of immigration agents at the facility.

She said when she asked the agents if they had a warrant to make an arrest at the medical center, they would not respond and shoved her.

Fuentes said she was later handcuffed and threatened with arrest.

""This is violence,"" Fuentes said.

Video shows the incident. Agents are seen claiming Fuentes was impeding their work.

The director of the hospital said, while United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can come into the emergency room, they cannot go into the operating room.

The hospital has no plans of releasing the person agents were originally trying to detain, who had broken his leg.

Fuentes said he broke his leg running from the agents. Attorneys were brought in to represent the person.

Fuentes also said federal immigration agents have brought a number of people to local hospitals, when they were injured during arrests.

That's false - NPR,Scott Neuman,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5560987/shutdown-undocumented-immigrants-medicaid-obamacare,"The White House and congressional Republicans say that Democratic lawmakers caused the federal government shutdown as part of an effort to extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants.
Republicans have accused the Democrats of holding the government hostage to a ""far-left wish list,"" including funding the health care of ""illegal aliens.""
They do not qualify for tax credits on the [ACA health care] exchanges,"" he says.
Gruber, who has worked on health and health care coverage policy for several decades, says the shutdown ""isn't about undocumented immigrants getting health care.
Gruber says health care is a complicated issue and ""the more complicated the issue, the easier it is to make a misleading claim.""","The White House and congressional Republicans say that Democratic lawmakers caused the federal government shutdown as part of an effort to extend health care benefits to undocumented immigrants. However, as several independent experts interviewed by NPR note, that claim is false.

At the center of the standoff is the Trump administration's Working Families Tax Cut Act, also known as President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" signed into law in July.

Democrats say it amounts to tax breaks for billionaires and pays for them with deep Medicaid cuts. The White House insists the law protects taxpayers by preventing undocumented immigrants from getting government health benefits — but such individuals were already barred from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, exchanges.

""It's a complete distortion,"" says Leighton Ku, the director of George Washington University's Center for Health Policy Research. It is ""simply wrong in the details,"" he says.

In the weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, when funding for the federal government was due to expire, GOP lawmakers introduced a continuing resolution to extend the funding until Nov. 21. But Democrats demanded that it also include an extension of ACA subsidies — set to expire at the end of the year — and the reversal of Medicaid cuts.

Republicans have accused the Democrats of holding the government hostage to a ""far-left wish list,"" including funding the health care of ""illegal aliens."" The White House has said the Republicans' legislation ensures ""that taxpayer dollars are focused on American citizens and do not subsidize healthcare for illegal immigrants.""

Jonathan Gruber, the chairman of the Economics Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the Republican claim is false. People living in the U.S. who are undocumented ""do not qualify for Medicaid. They do not qualify for tax credits on the [ACA health care] exchanges,"" he says.

KFF, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that analyzes national health issues, notes that U.S. health coverage programs for immigrants are generally limited to those lawfully present. Medicaid and CHIP — which provides low-cost coverage to uninsured children and pregnant women — are restricted to immigrants with a ""qualified"" status, such as refugees and asylees, most of whom must wait five years before enrolling.

Subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage is available to these qualified immigrants as well as others, including those with Temporary Protected Status or certain work visas, while Medicaid eligibility is limited to lawfully present immigrants who meet age and work requirements, according to KFF. The Center for Children & Families at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University has also fact-checked the claim and come to a similar conclusion.

By contrast, some states provide fully-state-funded medical care for some undocumented individuals, but even those programs are being rolled back. Beginning next year in California, for example, undocumented adults will no longer be able to enroll in that state's Medi-Cal program, although children will still be covered regardless of their immigration status.

Gruber, who has worked on health and health care coverage policy for several decades, says the shutdown ""isn't about undocumented immigrants getting health care. It's about cutting health insurance"" for millions of low-income Americans.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — another priority for Democrats — will be reduced by more than $1 trillion over the next decade as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Ku, of George Washington University, says part of the confusion is over the definition of who is and who isn't undocumented. ""Sometimes when Republicans use the phrase 'illegal immigrant,' they include people who actually have legal status — like asylees, refugees, or those with Temporary Protected Status — just because they don't like them.""

Although Emergency Medicaid does technically cover undocumented people, it serves mainly as a backstop for hospitals, who are required by law to treat patients turning up in emergency rooms, regardless of their immigration status. ""Medicaid just helps hospitals cover those costs,"" Ku says.

""Emergency Medicaid is one or two billion dollars out of a trillion-dollar program. It's a tiny fraction,"" he adds. ""This is a tail-wagging-the-dog problem. These issues are a minuscule part of Medicaid and ACA spending, but they're being blown up into something they're not.""

Gruber says health care is a complicated issue and ""the more complicated the issue, the easier it is to make a misleading claim.""

An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll published earlier this week found that 38% of Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown, 27% blame Democrats, and 31% believe both parties are to blame.

He says that for Republicans, claiming the shutdown is about extending health care to undocumented individuals ""sounds good, it feels good, and it plays into the idea that people who 'don't look like they belong here' are getting benefits. But it's just not true.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5269x2964+0+40/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F83%2F7f6e70ef4e91bbad17b82a2de801%2Fgettyimages-2238610200.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 11:58:54.598462

“The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin.
Downloads of apps including IceBlock have surged as the Trump administration steps up immigration enforcement with surprise raids.
“We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,” Apple said in a statement.
Officials said last month that a gunman who opened fire on an Ice facility in Dallas had searched for apps that tracked the presence of Ice agents.","Apple has removed an app from its App Store that uses crowdsourcing to flag sightings of US immigration agents after facing pressure from Donald Trump’s administration.

IceBlock, a free iPhone-only app that lets users anonymously report and monitor activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers, was no longer available on Friday. The app’s developer said last month that it had more than 1 million users.

“We just received a message from Apple’s App Review that #ICEBlock has been removed from the App Store due to “objectionable content’,” the developer said in a social media post. “The only thing we can imagine is this is due to pressure from the Trump Admin. We have responded and we’ll fight this!”

Even though it has been removed from the app marketplace, those who have already downloaded the app should still be able to use it. Downloads of apps including IceBlock have surged as the Trump administration steps up immigration enforcement with surprise raids. The technology has come under fire from authorities after agents were targeted.

“We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,” Apple said in a statement. “Based on information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.”

The app, first launched in April, was founded by indie musician turned entrepreneur Joshua Aaron. It’s a Waze-like app that allows users to alert others when they see Ice agents within a 5-mile radius of their current location. When Aaron first tried to put it on the Apple App Store, the release was pushed back for three weeks as he went back-and-forth with the company’s legal team and other “higher-ups” about the parameters of the app – including whether Aaron would be able to protect the privacy of IceBlock users.

“There were conversations almost on a daily basis with senior people there saying: ‘Is this even legal? Can we do this? Are we going to get in trouble for having this?’” Aaron previously told the Guardian.

The founder said Apple had a particularly difficult time understanding how Aaron, who did not intend to profit off the app and thus would not collect any data, would protect the privacy of the app’s users.

“Apple had a hard time wrapping their head around it, because they were like: ‘What do you mean you’re never going to make money? What do you mean you’re never going to track anything?’” Aaron said. “I was like: ‘Yeah, that’s the point. I don’t care.’ I don’t care about people’s data as far as being able to get analytics or track them or sell their data. I don’t care about any of that. I care about keeping people safe. That is literally the whole point. Eventually they allowed it on.”

In June – within two months of the app’s launch – Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said the app and its founder were “obstructing justice”. At the time, Noem suggested prosecuting CNN for reporting on the app. Months later, Aaron’s wife, Carolyn Feinstein, lost her job at the Department of Justice – a move the duo said they believe was “retaliation” for the creation and operation of IceBlock.

In a July interview on Fox News, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, said crowdsourced apps that allow people to communicate about the location of law enforcement officers is not allowed, specifically referring to IceBlock.

“We are looking at him and he better watch out because that’s not a protected speech,” Bondi said at the time, referring to Aaron.

Aaron responded to Bondi’s threat directly, telling the Guardian: “Please, come on. I better watch out? Why? I’m protected under the first amendment. This is perfectly legal, and I made sure of that.”

Yet there are many apps that track law enforcement and remain available to users, such as Waze or Google Maps. Those apps, in addition to providing navigation, alert drivers of potential locations of speed traps.

The Proclamation requires employers to pay a $100,000 fee with any new H-1B petition for foreign workers outside the United States, effective Sept. 21, 2025. The stated purpose is to address perceived misuse of the H-1B program and protect the domestic labor market.

On Oct. 3, 2025, a coalition of immigration advocacy organizations and affected employers filed a lawsuit in federal court in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California challenging the legality of the Proclamation. The plaintiffs include healthcare staffing companies, unions, academic associations, religious organizations, and individual workers.

The lawsuit contends that the $100,000 fee is unauthorized by statute, was implemented without required procedures, and will cause significant harm to U.S. employers, workers, and the public interest. The lawsuit alleges:

The Proclamation exceeds presidential authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Plaintiffs assert that INA §§ 212(f) and 215(a) do not authorize the President to impose such a fee.

The $100,000 fee was imposed without notice-and-comment rulemaking, violating the Administrative Procedures Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The $100,000 fee is arbitrary and capricious, untethered from the actual costs of adjudicating H-1B petitions.

The complaint also details how the fee has “sparked chaos,” caused confusion, forced workers to return to the U.S. abruptly, and led employers to halt or cancel recruitment and hiring of foreign talent. Plaintiffs argue that the fee will worsen shortages in healthcare, education, and religious services, and disrupt ongoing research and innovation.

Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the fee from taking effect, requesting that the court:

Declare sections of the Proclamation and related agency policies unlawful and set them aside.

Enjoin enforcement of the $100,000 fee requirement as to H-1B petition adjudications, visa issuance, and admission.

Order agencies to process H-1B petitions under existing law, without the new fee.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California, is led by a coalition of religious organizations, health care providers, unions, higher education professionals and others.

“Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators,” Democracy Forward said in the press release. “The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.”

Trump penned a proclamation on Sept. 19 raising the fee on H1-B visas to $100,000, arguing the program has been exploited to replace Americans with foreign-born workers who get paid less. Days later, the White House said the $100,000 is a one-time fee for future H-1B applicants and those with the visa will not have to pay the fee again to enter back into the U.S.

“By discouraging the best and brightest minds from around the world—individuals who have enriched American higher education for decades—he’s sending a message: ‘You’re not welcome here. Go elsewhere,'” Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, wrote Friday.

This short-sighted policy doesn’t just hurt universities — it hurts every American by slowing research breakthroughs, weakening our economy, and putting our global leadership at risk,” he added.

Critics of the H-1B visa program, which was created by Congress to attract highly skilled workers from overseas, argue that it is a way for U.S. companies to hire foreign-born workers who are open to working far below market value, particularly in the tech sector.

About a third of workers with this type of visa are nurses, teachers, physicians, scholars, priests and pastors, according to the lawsuit. Many H-1B visa holders work in the technology sector, but over a third of all H-1B workers are other fields, according to the lawsuit.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Reuters that the administration is engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.”

H-1B visas are valid for three years and can be extended up to six, according to according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

A lawsuit filed today in Northern California District Court seeks to stop the Trump administration from imposing a $100,000 fee on new H1-b visa applications.

The program is designed to bolster the labor pool of occupations facing a labor shortage such as technology, health care and education.

A coalition of labor unions, health care providers, schools, and religious organizations joined together to file the lawsuit. The fee would be paid by employers.

The complaint alleges both President Trump and numerous government agencies including Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection and Department of State overstepped their statutory authority in imposing the fee.

It also accuses the plaintiffs of bypassing rulemaking procedures which require the public to be given an opportunity to comment before rules are finalized and implemented.

“South Asians make up the majority of H-1B workers and are part of the fabric of America, staffing rural hospitals, advancing lifesaving research, and driving innovation in businesses across the country. This unlawful fee threatens workers, their families, and the financial and social wellbeing of the communities in which they live,” said Kalpana V. Peddibhotla, Executive Director of the South Asian American Justice Collaborative.

The Justice Collaborative along with Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, and Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation joined together to file the case for the plaintiffs.

US Circuit Judge David Barron said Trump's order violated the US Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states that anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen. He said the length of the court's 100-page ruling should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question was difficult.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the court had misinterpreted the 14th Amendment.

""We look forward to being vindicated by the Supreme Court,"" she said in a statement.

Meanwhile the US Supreme Court has again cleared the way for the Trump administration to revoke a temporary legal protection for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants.

The justices granted the administration's request to put on hold a judge's ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to end the Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, granted under President Joe Biden while litigation proceeds. The Court's three liberal justices dissented.

""I view today's decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,"" liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote.

The court, Jackson wrote, is ""privileging the bald assertion of unconstrained executive power"" over judgements made by lower courts that these 300,000 people should not be ""left vulnerable to job loss, family separation and deportation"" to Venezuela until the legality of the administration's actions is fully resolved.

Jackson noted that the US government in January concluded that Venezuela was experiencing a humanitarian crisis.

The TPS program is a humanitarian designation under US law for countries stricken by war, natural disaster or other catastrophes, giving recipients living in the United States deportation protection and access to work permits.

""This is another win for the administration affirming what we have always maintained: Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary. It was never intended to be a pathway to permanent status or legal residency,"" Abigail Jackson said after the decision.

And in a separate anti-immigration strategy, the Trump administration said it would pay migrant children $2,500 to voluntarily return to their home countries.

The notice to shelters from the US Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Families and Children did not indicate any consequences for children who decline the offer.

Officials dismissed widespread reports among immigration lawyers and advocates that it was about to launch a much broader crackdown to deport migrant children who entered the country without their parents.

Advocates said $2,500 may prevent children from making informed decisions.

""For a child, $2,500 might be the most money they've ever seen in their life, and that may make it very, very difficult for them to accurately weigh the long-term risks of taking voluntary departure versus trying to stay in the United States and going through the immigration court process to get relief that they may be legally entitled to,"" said Melissa Adamson, senior attorney at the National Centre for Youth Law.

US authorities have arrested children crossing the border without parents more than 400,000 times since October 2021.

On Friday, one more court weighed in, and the result was no different.

A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston said in a unanimous decision that the Republican president cannot enforce the order. The court joined the four others that earlier had issued or upheld decisions blocking it nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to have the final word on birthright citizenship. The Trump administration has already asked the high court to take up the issue.

Federal judges have made clear how much his order conflicts with Supreme Court precedent, to say nothing of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is not bound by what those lower court judges have said or even its own past rulings. Nonetheless, those losses could mean an uphill fight for his administration even in front of the justices, who have so far sided with the president on many legal challenges to his effort to remake the government.

The 14th Amendment

The right to citizenship at birth has long been a bedrock principle in the United States, widely accepted to have been granted by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in 1868. It was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The amendment includes a citizenship clause that says all people born or naturalized in the U.S. and “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are citizens.

Administration lawyers have argued that inclusion of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means that citizenship is not automatically conferred to children based on their birth in the U.S. They contend it requires children to have primary allegiance to the U.S., and people who are in the U.S. illegally or temporarily — and by extension, their children — cannot claim that because their permanent home is another country to which that allegiance is tied.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that the 1st Circuit was misinterpreting the 14th Amendment.

Legal scholars say the administration’s interpretation is countered by the amendment’s history and subsequent Supreme Court rulings.

Experts say members of Congress who debated the amendment clearly understood it would establish an expansive definition of birthright citizenship that included the children of immigrants, and they meant the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as subject to U.S. law. The children of Native Americans on tribal land and the children of foreign diplomats — both of whom had immunity from U.S. sovereign authority — were the primary groups of people the clause was meant to exclude from birthright citizenship, according to scholars.

Supreme Court rulings

In 1898, the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, found that the son of Chinese immigrants was a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment, based on his birth in San Francisco. The high court has never ruled directly on the citizenship clause’s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, but a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference between them and the children of foreign-born parents who are in the U.S. legally.

The court’s conservative majority took up a challenge to the birthright order earlier this year, but did not decide its constitutionality. Instead, the court used the case to issue a ruling in June limiting the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a victory for the administration.

Lower court decisions

Starting with a federal judge in New Hampshire, court after court has blocked the order.

The justices in June did not rule out court orders with nationwide effects in class-action lawsuits and lawsuits brought by states.

Two of the judges who recently ruled against the birthright order certified a class of all children born in the U.S. after the order’s February effective date who would be denied citizenship on its basis.

In two other rulings, courts agreed with states that a patchwork approach to implementing the order would not relieve them of its financial burden, noting the regular movement of people between states and the possibility of a state resident giving birth in another state. Citizenship status is a prerequisite for certain government benefits, so the plaintiff states would have to overhaul their eligibility systems to account for such distinctions, the rulings by the 9th U.S. Circuit and a federal judge in Boston said.

The 1st Circuit said its decision was easy.

“The length of our analysis should not be mistaken for a sign that the fundamental question that these cases raise about the scope of birthright citizenship is a difficult one,” Chief Judge David Barron wrote. “It is not, which may explain why it has been more than a century since a branch of our government has made as concerted an effort as the Executive Branch now makes to deny Americans their birthright.”

White House response

In her statement on Friday, Jackson said the administration looked forward to “being vindicated by the Supreme Court.”

To enforce the order, government officials would need to confirm parental citizenship or immigration status before issuing Social Security numbers. Passport applications would also require proof of parental citizenship or immigration status, according to recent guidance documents from the administration.

Cedillo said there was a story about Miguel Angel that wasn’t being told.
The main message, Cedillo and others told mourners: remember the names of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Norlan Guzman Fuentes.","Candles in the shape of a heart were placed outside Dallas City Hall Friday night as dozens of community members gathered to mourn the loss of two migrants killed in last month’s shooting outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office.

Norlan Guzman Fuentes from El Salvador died in the attack early Sept. 24; Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez from Mexico died almost a week later from his injuries.

""We have to fight for a future for a world where these things don't happen. A future where immigrants can live safely and can live in peace,"" said Judith, a community organizer with Venceremos DFW, who only identified herself by her first name.

A third victim, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, was recently released from Parkland Hospital and is in ICE custody at the Prairieland Detention Center. Large signs with Guzman Fuentes’ and Garcia Hernandez’ names served as a backdrop to the event.

During the vigil, people placed bouquets of flowers and hand-painted umbrellas that read “keep families together.”

Several community groups and activists partnered for the vigil, including Noemi Rios, a community organizer and founder of Vecinos Unidos DFW. The vigil was to acknowledge the victims, who she said weren’t treated humanely after their injuries.

“We are here to name that but as well as to acknowledge that this isn't isolated,” she said. “The brutality that ICE is bringing to Dallas is the same as the brutality we are seeing across the country.”

Activists read a statement from Guzman Fuentes’ sister, who lives in North Carolina. She wanted people to know that he had a family -- ”eight siblings and a mother who loved him dearly.”

In the statement, she said she hasn’t been able to see her brother’s body and properly grieve.

""She wants people to know she was told she didn't need to identify her brother because they took his fingerprints,” the statement read. “She's asking for justice for her brother and all those whose families have been victims of this violence.”

Federal authorities say the suspected shooter, Joshua Jahn of Fairview, was targeting law enforcement when he opened fire on the ICE office from the roof of a nearby building, striking the three detainees.

Garcia-Hernandez was taken into ICE custody since Aug. 8. He had lived in the U.S. since he was a teen, his wife, Stephany Gauffeny, told NPR.

Eric Cedillo, a immigration attorney and civil rights advocate who represents Gauffeny, told the audience that she wanted to be there, but had given birth earlier in the day to a son named Miles Alexander Garcia.

“ A little boy unfortunately who will never know his father, because Miguel's life was taken, f or absolutely no good reason,” Cedillo said.

Cedillo said there was a story about Miguel Angel that wasn’t being told. On the day of the shooting, Miguel Angel was sitting on the bus at the ICE field office, talking to an 18-year-old man about his wife and kids, when bullets crashed through the window.

“He turned to the boy and said, ‘I don't think I'm going to make it. Get underneath me. Let me shield you,’” Cedillo said. “That's the story that needs to get out. The heroism that was Miguel Garcia.”

Kate Lincoln-Golfinch, an immigration attorney and legal adviser for the League of United Latin American Citizens saidit’s important to counter the narrative about migrants without legal status and appreciate and respect them instead.

""It takes a whole lot for somebody to pick up their whole life and come to a brand new culture just because they want something better for themselves and their children,” she said. “That is something that I have a lot of admiration for and I know a lot us do. And that's the message that we need to be talking about more than what we're hearing on the other side.""

The main message, Cedillo and others told mourners: remember the names of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez and Norlan Guzman Fuentes.

“Everyone here, remember those names, remember those people, remember those families that we've lost,” Cedillo said, “because unfortunately, over the next few months, there's going to be so many others that we're never going to hear about.”

Lawyers for Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia say the Constitution demands his habeas corpus lawsuit, challenging his current detention and potential deportation, must go on during the U.S. government shutdown — and that he should be placed on home detention.

It comes after Justice Department lawyers filed a motion Wednesday requesting a stay in all aspects of the case because of the shutdown. They said government attorneys “are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ’emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.’”

But in a motion filed late Thursday, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argued the government failed to mention that the habeas corpus law “expressly instructs that in the event of a lapse of appropriations, this Court will continue to ‘hear and dispose of pending cases.’”

As of Friday morning, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis had not issued an order on whether an evidentiary hearing in Abrego Garcia’s case scheduled for Monday will proceed as scheduled.

With the status of the case uncertain, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers also note the government doesn’t have the right to detain him indefinitely.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers suggest Xinis impose the same conditions a Tennessee judge earlier ordered when releasing him before a trial there for human smuggling — third-party custody, electronic monitoring, home detention and regular reporting to Pretrial Services.

“If this Court orders Petitioner’s release from immigration custody, he would remain under these strict supervision requirements, ensuring both his appearance at future proceedings and addressing any alleged public safety concerns, however misplaced those may be,” Abrego Garcia’s lawyers wrote.

A U.S. immigration judge in Baltimore denied a bid for asylum on Wednesday, rejecting an application to reopen Abrego Garcia’s 2019 asylum case. He has 30 days to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Outside of court, officials with President Donald Trump’s administration have repeatedly referred to Abrego Garcia as a member of the MS-13 gang, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

In recent weeks the Broadview facility has become the site of escalations by federal agents against protesters and journalists. Videos of agents deploying tear gas, pepper balls and roughly throwing protesters to the ground have gone viral, amidst the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The Trump administration targeted Chicago with federal law enforcement starting in August, falsely claiming there had been a rise in crime in the city in recent years. Since then, there have been increasingly aggressive reports of Ice enforcement in communities, including helicopters hovering over apartment raids. There have also been arrests of local officials and candidates for office who were protesting, including Illinois’ ninth congressional district Kat Abughazaleh, who went viral with a video of an Ice agent slamming her to the ground, Daniel Biss, the Evanston mayor, and a city alderman who were aggressively arrested while trying to advocate in a hospital setting.

In Broadview, several people were arrested early Friday morning, after Ice along with Illinois state police, the Cook county sheriff’s office and other local law enforcement arrested and shoved protesters gathered for a weekly demonstration.

A local cabinet-making business, adjacent to the Broadview Ice processing facility, has had tear gas seep into their warehouse and workers hit by pepper balls, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

On Thursday, a group of Illinois law enforcement agencies, including the Broadview police department had announced they were forming a unified command to “enable the peaceful expression of the first amendment”, as well as ensure that local businesses and people in Broadview were kept safe, according to a press release. The statement also said: “The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law.”

Broadview, the mostly Black, working-class suburb of around 8,000 people, has become a flashpoint in what the Department of Homeland Security has deemed “Operation Midway Blitz.” There aren’t any figures publicly available for how many people are detained at the Broadview facility, which is not staffed or intended to be run as a detention center.

In the state of Illinois, almost 5,000 people have been detained this year, according to data from The Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Chicago Sun-Times.

For the people detained inside the facility, they describe not receiving adequate food or water, and having to use the bathroom in public. One person described to a Chicago Sun-Times reporter, not having soap or toothpaste and dealing with severely overcrowded conditions.

Katrina Thompson, the Broadway mayor who has been in office in since 2017, said in a letter to DHS that Ice agents were “making war in our community”, last Friday, and in response the agency warned there would be a “s—t show” in Broadview.

The treatment of protesters and journalists has drawn attention to Broadview.

One protester, named A’keisha who declined to share her last name, said that it seemed like Ice agents wanted to hurt protesters.

“What was unique on the first day is that it didn’t feel like Ice had planned to use their legal tools to remove us,” she said. “They have the right, right to say, ‘Y’all gotta leave, arrest them.’ But they didn’t. They chose instead to be violent and, like, push us and throw us to the ground and drag us.”

A’keisha has been involved in faith-based movements to end mass incarceration for years and has organized against militarization for almost a decade. She said she was moved to join protests because of her Haitian heritage and solidarity with immigrant communities.

Another protester, Reverand David Black of the First Presbyterian church of Chicago, said that he was pelted with about seven or eight “pepper exploding pellets” that hit his head, face, torso, arms and legs, while in a position of prayer.

“I’m not a political ideologue, but I am very deeply rooted in my faith, in the ways that it calls me to show up in this moment as someone who can proclaim the good news and call these Ice agents into their right mind,” he said.

Local journalists have been detained or attacked by federal agents as well. Over the weekend, Steve Held, Unraveled Press co-founder and reporter, was detained by agents while covering a protest outside of the facility. A Chicago-Sun Times reporter was also tear-gassed and pelted with “rubber projectiles”, according to the outlet.

On Sunday morning, CBS Chicago News reporter Asal Rezaei, was attacked by an Ice agent who shot a pepper ball into her car from about 50ft away and was exposed to chemicals on her face. She said in a social media post that after the incident, she was “puking for two hours”.

In addition to protesters and journalists, legal observers, often delineated in the Chicago-land area by their bright neon green hats that read “legal observer” were also attacked in recent weeks by Ice agents.

“There has been an extreme escalation in the use of force by federal agents at that facility against people who are exercising their first amendment rights, and targeted attacks against members of the press and legal observers with The National Lawyers Guild,” said Molly Armour, a volunteer attorney with the National Lawyers Guild Chicago for over 15 years.

What was most troubling about the behavior of federal agents at Broadview for her, Armour said, was the use of “violent military-style offensive weaponry used against people, such as tear gas canisters, [and] different kinds of aerosol chemical agents”, particularly against people just observing what’s going on.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/528f3b8b39b7fbba993d001bcb1a971db339cabc/191_0_2618_2094/master/2618.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3beaf0829c342d97d6e521086d5c4c54",N,,2025-10-04 07:58:52.818970

“We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement on Thursday.
“ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed.

This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.” Fox News Digital first reported on the app’s removal.

A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the ICEBlock link to the Apple store delivers a message, “App not available.”

Watch on Deadline

Last month, FBI Director Kash Patel said that the assailant who opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas had search ICE tracking apps.

Joshua Aaron, the creator of the app, said in a statement, “I am incredibly disappointed by Apple’s actions. Capitulating to an authoritarian regime is never the right move. Apple has claimed they received information from law enforcement that ICEBlock served to harm law enforcement officers. This is patently false.

“ICEBlock is no different from crowd sourcing speed traps, which every notable mapping application, including Apple’s own Maps app, implements as part of its core services. This is protected speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.”

He said that they were “determined to fight this with everything we have. Our mission has always been to protect our neighbors from the terror this administration continues to reign down on the people of this nation. We will not be deterred. We will not stop.”

The White House previously lashed out at CNN for even reporting on the app, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was working with the DOJ to see if they could prosecute the network.

At the time, a CNN spokesperson said, “This is an app that is publicly available to any iPhone user who wants to download it. There is nothing illegal about reporting the existence of this or any other app, nor does such reporting constitute promotion or other endorsement of the app by CNN.”

At the start of his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ensure that “no Federal Government officer, employee, or agent engages in or facilitates any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.”

At the time, Trump and others on the right had alleged that the Biden administration had exerted undue pressure on social media platforms to remove Covid-related content they deemed as misinformation.

Trump’s executive order said, “Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve.”

Illinois State Police officers were in Broadview Friday morning with other local agencies as part of a temporary unified command to handle public safety at the site.
“The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,” said Illinois State Police spokeswoman Melaney Arnold.
However, those laws don’t prevent police from helping ICE in other ways – in this instance, helping control crowds around the Broadview facility.
JB Pritzker has long said that state and local police cannot help federal immigration authorities under the TRUST Act.","Illinois State Police were among several state and local agencies in Broadview Friday morning during a protest in what’s becoming a series of near-daily demonstrations at the suburban ICE processing facility.

State troopers joined police from Broadview, the Cook County Sheriffs’ Dept. and the Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS) as they assisted ICE to control the crowd of roughly 100 people.

The tensions flared in the morning following the installation of concrete barriers along Beach St. near the ICE facilities in an attempt to create a protest zone to keep people out of the roadways.

Why were state police there? Doesn’t state law prevent them from helping ICE?

Top Illinois Democrats have said for months that local police won’t participate in immigration investigations, but they also won’t stand in the way.

Illinois State Police officers were in Broadview Friday morning with other local agencies as part of a temporary unified command to handle public safety at the site. The village of Broadview requested the concrete barriers as part of the plan.

“The agencies involved in this operation will neither assist nor obstruct enforcement of federal immigration statutes in compliance with state and federal law,” said Illinois State Police spokeswoman Melaney Arnold.

But State Police officers were seen on video controlling the crowd – standing alongside federal officers in camouflage gear as multiple agencies, local and federal, attempted to control the protest.

What do Illinois’ sanctuary laws say about this?

Local police aren’t allowed to get involved in federal civil immigration enforcement under the Illinois TRUST Act. They can’t arrest people solely based on their real or perceived immigration status, and they can’t give information to the feds that isn’t already public.

However, those laws don’t prevent police from helping ICE in other ways – in this instance, helping control crowds around the Broadview facility.

What are Illinois’s elected leaders saying?

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has long said that state and local police cannot help federal immigration authorities under the TRUST Act.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul also released a statement Friday supporting ISP’s efforts in Broadview. He said their presence is crucial to protecting local homes and businesses.

“In accordance with the TRUST Act, the purpose of the activities conducted by the unified command is to maintain public safety and the ability to lawfully exercise First Amendment rights – not to engage in federal immigration enforcement,” Raoul said in the statement.

“State and local law enforcement do not violate the TRUST Act by establishing and maintaining designated protest areas and ensuring the unobstructed use of public roads - even if federal immigration enforcement activity is occurring nearby.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/62e1fd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7011x4002+0+337/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8b%2Fbf%2Fe05e957e444f83543ec83e923b34%2Fbroadviewprotest-100425-023.JPG,N,,2025-10-04 03:56:27.566925

The President directed the Department of War [sic] to conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.
Congress hasn’t authorized any military action against cartels.
The ambiguous language of the proposal would also potentially allow U.S. military action against anyone the military deems to be involved with cartels across 60 different countries.
Meanwhile, the White House has indicated that it hasn’t ruled out using military force within Venezuela, where many cartels operate.","President Donald Trump told Congress on October 2 that the United States is now formally engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which his administration has labeled “unlawful combatants” — an attempt to provide legal cover for unilateral action against civilians.

Trump’s announcement was made without a formal Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) from Congress and violates constitutional requirements saying that only the legislative branch can declare war.

The news comes after the U.S. military illegally bombed at least three boats in the Caribbean Sea over the past month, claiming, without evidence, that they were targeting drug traffickers. The attacks killed 17 people and have been condemned by human rights organizations as “unlawful extrajudicial killings.”

The memo to Congress states in part that:

Based upon the cumulative effects of these hostile acts against the citizens and interests of the United States…the President determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations. The President directed the Department of War [sic] to conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.

Congress hasn’t authorized any military action against cartels. Ordinarily, members of cartels are civilians, subject to the domestic criminal laws of the countries they operate in, and afforded due process. Under this logic, the administration’s strikes on the boats in the Caribbean would amount to extrajudicial killings, which is what some legal experts have already designated the attacks. This new determination from the Trump administration attempts to bypass that, equating drug cartels in general to “non-state armed groups” and individuals to “unlawful combatants,” and suggesting that “their actions constitute an armed attack against the United States.” This would mean the administration’s actions were subject to international humanitarian law, rather than domestic U.S. law. Even international humanitarian law requires the parties of armed conflicts to distinguish between combatants and civilians when targeting attacks.

The move essentially means the U.S. has been engaged in a “secret war” for the past several weeks, many critics contend, even as the administration has yet to provide evidence that the boats it bombed were actually operated by drug cartels. Indeed, a woman who identified herself as the wife of a man killed by the strikes said her husband was a fisherman with four children. He left for work one day and never came back, she said.

Geoffrey S. Corn, a retired judge advocate general lawyer, told The New York Times that the administration’s action goes beyond the pale.

“This is not stretching the envelope. This is shredding it. This is tearing it apart,” Corn said.

Meanwhile, a draft proposal to obtain an AUMF has been circulating in Congress. If passed, it would grant the Trump administration broad powers to target so-called “narco-terrorists” under domestic law. The ambiguous language of the proposal would also potentially allow U.S. military action against anyone the military deems to be involved with cartels across 60 different countries.

It’s unclear whether the White House has enough votes in Congress to pass such a measure, as it would likely be blocked by a Senate filibuster.

Meanwhile, the White House has indicated that it hasn’t ruled out using military force within Venezuela, where many cartels operate. Such an action would likely lead to a crisis — and potentially a war — between Venezuela and the U.S.

“If Venezuela is sending drug cartels to the United States by land or sea, he’ll consider action on it,” a senior official in the Trump White House told Semafor, notably leaving out that, legally, Congress would have to weigh in on the matter.

Critics condemned Trump’s announcement, warning that bypassing Congress to declare war could have dire consequences.

“Trump doesn’t get to ‘determine’ we’re at war — that’s Congress’s job,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said, adding that the matter “isn’t about public safety” but rather is “a power grab” by Trump.

“Trump’s actions are illegal, unconstitutional, and dangerous,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts) chimed in.

“These children have every right to pursue SIJS,” said Sophia Gregg, ACLU senior immigrants’ rights attorney.
According to the ACLU, their detention is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to classify immigrant youth with SIJS as “arriving noncitizens,” subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond hearings.
The ACLU is seeking the immediate release of the named plaintiffs, as well as a ruling that would guarantee bond hearings for similarly situated minors nationwide.
The complaints accuse the federal agencies of tampering with webpages and automatic out-of-office emails to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia has filed a class-action lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s administration’s policy of detaining immigrant children without bond hearings, stating the practice violates decades of federal law intended to protect vulnerable youth.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Eastern District of Virginia, names four plaintiffs who came to the U.S. after being abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents. All have obtained or applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a legal designation Congress created nearly 40 years ago to provide a pathway to citizenship for children who cannot safely return to their home countries.

“These children have every right to pursue SIJS,” said Sophia Gregg, ACLU senior immigrants’ rights attorney. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “recategorizing and reconsidering the entire federal regulations … and their justification really doesn’t hold any water.”

The four plaintiffs are currently being held at the Farmville and Caroline detention facilities in Virginia. According to the ACLU, their detention is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to classify immigrant youth with SIJS as “arriving noncitizens,” subject to mandatory detention and ineligible for bond hearings.

“We’re seeing this across the country for all individuals. Millions of people, potentially, are in immigration detention who would otherwise not have been a few months ago,” Gregg told WTOP. “Those unaccompanied minors are protected under the many federal laws and anti-trafficking laws that are specifically intended to protect children.”

Under the SIJS process, immigrant children must first be released to a sponsor, placed under custody orders from a state judge, and then they can apply for status. Visa availability can take years, but the protections Congress established were designed to prevent children from being detained while they wait.

Instead, the ACLU lawsuit argues, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is keeping children locked up and cutting them off from the ability to pursue their cases and effectively pressuring them to abandon their rights.

Gregg called the policy part of “a mass deportation agenda,” adding these are kids “Congress intended to protect … and identified as being the most vulnerable and in need of protection.”

“The immigration courts are now taking the position, as is the rest of the Trump administration, that nobody, including this specifically vulnerable group, is entitled to hearings for the release under bond pending their immigration cases,” Gregg said.

The case, Sarmiento v. Crawford, was filed with co-counsel Tanishka Cruz of Cruz Law, and Patrice Kopistansky. The ACLU is seeking the immediate release of the named plaintiffs, as well as a ruling that would guarantee bond hearings for similarly situated minors nationwide.

Violation of the Hatch Act

On Friday, the watchdog group Public Citizen filed 11 complaints against major agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration and the White House.

The complaints accuse the federal agencies of tampering with webpages and automatic out-of-office emails to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.

As of Friday afternoon, HUD’s website featured a banner and a pop-up message blaming the “Radical Left” for the current federal government shutdown.

Ethics experts argue the edits violate the Hatch Act, which bars political activity in federal workplaces and protects employees from partisan pressure. They warn the coordinated changes not only misrepresent federal workers but also use government resources to sway voters.

“This is unique. … These agencies are the biggest agencies in the federal government. You’ve got a coordinated effort coming from the White House to get the entire federal government and all the different agencies working together to try to influence the electoral mood of the American public to support Donald Trump and oppose Democrats. I’ve never seen this type of scope of violation of the Hatch Act before in my life,” government affairs lobbyist Craig Holman said.

Holman, who filed the complaints with Public Citizen, added, “This ought to be enough to actually make the Office of Special Counsel do something, or if they don’t do something, it gives me grounds for litigation.”
