Gavin Newsom was holding on congressional redistricting.

The governor’s event had nothing to do with immigration, and local elected officials expressed outrage that the federal agents decided to stand there in a brazen show of force outside a museum where Mr. Newsom and other leaders were speaking.

As the governor was preparing to speak inside the Japanese American National Museum in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles, the agents assembled outside, many of them masked and armed, and some wearing tactical helmets and carrying rifles.

“This is just completely unacceptable,” Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles told reporters. “This is a Customs and Border Patrol that has gone amok. This absolutely has to stop. There was no danger here.”

The presence of the agents on Thursday came as Democratic leaders in California, including Mr. Newsom and Ms. Bass, have sparred with the federal government over widespread immigration raids in recent weeks.

Mr. Newsom has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration, and he sued the federal government for deploying National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell protests this summer. The City of Los Angeles also joined a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security over how the raids have been conducted. In June, dozens of federal agents marched through MacArthur Park, in a neighborhood that is home to many immigrants, an action that drew criticism from local officials.

It was not immediately clear whether the agents who arrived on Thursday were patrolling the neighborhood or were part of a targeted operation.

A video shared on social media by Mr. Newsom’s press office shows the agents gathering outside the museum. In the video, Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol chief who is leading the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Southern California, says, “We’re here making Los Angeles a safer place, since we don’t have politicians who can do that. We do that ourselves.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

When Mr. Newsom was asked by reporters about Border Patrol’s appearance outside his event, the governor said, “It’s pretty sick and pathetic.” He added that it said everything people need to know “about Donald Trump’s America.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/14/multimedia/14nat-border-patrol-newsom-jwvz/14nat-border-patrol-newsom-jwvz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:37.831452

Since the president’s decision Monday to invoke the district’s Home Rule Act, checkpoints are being set up in busy neighborhoods, bulldozers are clearing out tents of people experiencing homelessness and Republican governors are volunteering their own National Guard members to bolster the president’s federalization of the district’s 68 square miles.

Videos of masked law enforcement officers making Washingtonians step out of their cars and conducting arrests have been posted on social media by journalists, drawing concern over civil liberties.

While Trump’s control of the district’s police force ends in 28 days, he’s signaled he wants Congress to extend his authority to deter the “crime emergency.”

Advocates questioned the situation. “There does appear to be evidence that non (Metropolitan Police Department) federal authorities may have exceeded the lawful bounds at some of those traffic stops … and there will be accountability if the law is violated,” said Norm Eisen, the executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, a litigation organization that has challenged many of the Trump administration’s actions, in a call with reporters.

Trump predicts enforcement ‘all over the country’

The checkpoints have drawn backlash from district residents and local elected leaders.

In a statement, district Councilmember Brianne Nadeau criticized the immigration enforcement at checkpoints.

“Last night what would have been a routine MPD traffic safety operation was co-opted by federal law enforcement agents,” she said. “Agents who are not trained in D.C. law. Agents who do not know our community. Agents who were not seeking to address traffic safety but rather were interrogating drivers on their immigration status.”

Trump Thursday said that law enforcement using the checkpoints as immigration enforcement was “a great step.”

“I think that's going to happen all over the country,” the president told reporters at the White House after signing a proclamation celebrating Social Security‘s 90th birthday. “We want to stop crime.”

Violent crime in the district is at a historic 30-year low, according to the Department of Justice.

Eisen called the checkpoints unlawful.

“They're using it as an immigration control checkpoint,” he said. “That is illegal.”

Bulldozing camps for homeless people

Homeless camps across the district are also being cleared as part of the president’s directive.

Trump Wednesday signaled that he plans to send a request to Congress for “a relatively small amount of money” to make improvements to the district.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that if those people experiencing homelessness don’t agree to go to a shelter, they could face fines or jail.

“The homeless problem has ravaged the city,” Leavitt said. “Homeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services, and if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”

The district has faced a backlog in getting vouchers to those experiencing homelessness, according to Street Sense Media, a news outlet that focuses on reporting on homelessness in the district.

Local police to aid feds on immigration actions

The district's police chief Thursday issued a new executive order allowing local police to aid federal officials in immigration enforcement for immigrants not in police custody.

The new order does not change the district's law that prohibits local police from sharing information with federal immigration officials about people in police custody. It’s a policy for which Trump has criticized the city, calling it a “sanctuary city,” but the policy does not bar immigration enforcement.

Trump called Thursday’s executive order “a very positive thing,” especially at checkpoints in the district.

“When they stop people, they find they're illegal, they report them, they give them to us,” he said.

Since taking office for a second term, the president has intertwined military involvement in immigration enforcement, such as sending thousands of troops to the southern border and deploying thousands of National Guard members to Los Angeles after protests sparked by the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

More National Guard movements possible

Additionally, the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

On Wednesday, in another new twist, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he’s prepared to send his National Guard members to the district. Lee added that U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told him that the military might request states send troops to the district for law enforcement.

The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

While the president has stated he also wants to send in National Guard members to other cities – Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors, like he has done with the district, it can’t be replicated, said Abbe Lowell, a high-profile defense attorney.

“One thing that people need to remember about his assault on the District of Columbia, it is a very unique legal framework because of the Home Rule Act that gives him some ability to do something which he does not have in other states and cities where the governors still have some or the primary control over things like the National Guard,” said Lowell, who was with Eisen on the call with reporters.

A trial is underway this week challenging Trump’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.

‘Racial undertones’ cited by Baltimore mayor

Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott said Trump’s singling out of those cities, including the district, can’t be ignored.

“Every city that he called out had a Black mayor, and we're talking about Black-led cities,” he said on the call with Eisen and Lowell. “We cannot overstate the racial undertones here.”

Scott also criticized the Trump administration for pulling federal law enforcement officers – Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI, Customs and Border Patrol – from their duties. Instead they are “patrolling neighbors of Washington DC, stopping residents and checking cars instead of doing their actual jobs,” Scott said.

“If the president really wants to help these cities continue to lower violence and crime, he could go back to sending agents to their actual agencies and having them help us work on gun trafficking, work on violent drug organizations, and not taking these agents off to work on this immigration brigade that he's had them on,” Scott said.

He added that he’s working closely with Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore and “we’ll be prepared to take any legal and any other action that we need to take.”

Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, has criticized the president for calling in the National Guard to the district and raised concerns that service members do not have the same training as police officers.

Trump brushed those concerns off on Thursday.

“They're trained in common sense,” the president said of National Guard members.

Emergencies

Eisen said Trump’s actions in the district are part of the president’s pattern of invoking “non-emergencies.”

On Inauguration Day, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, despite low levels of immigration.

In March, he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law only used three times previously.

Trump’s decision to declare a “crime emergency” in the district earlier this week came after a former U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, official was injured in an attempted carjacking incident around 3 a.m. Eastern near the Logan Circle neighborhood. Two Maryland teenagers were arrested on charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the incident.

“Well, what he's doing in the District of Columbia, including illegal traffic stops, what he's doing is of a piece with that dictatorial approach,” Eisen said of the president.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/dccrackdown.jpg?h=af3b6faf&itok=T7oG3nyl,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:42.222772

This year, the definition of human rights is limited in a way that appears to reflect President Donald Trump’s “America First” ideology.

The report makes lesser efforts to track previously identified abuses, such as imprisonments without trials, unnecessary government surveillance and LGBTQ hate crimes.

The State Department’s annual report has traditionally been the gold standard on monitoring international human rights since it was established in 1977. It lists human rights practices in nearly 200 countries.

This year’s report appears to reflect Trump administration policy of making foreign concerns a lower priority.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has shut down State Department divisions that dealt with human rights and labor issues and fired many of their employees. The Trump administration also closed the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The 2025 report goes easier on countries that are perceived as friendly toward Trump, such as El Salvador, Hungary, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” the report said about El Salvador.

A year earlier, the Biden administration report discussed “significant human rights issues” in El Salvador based on allegations of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture and harsh prison conditions.

Since Trump took office, hundreds of illegal immigrants with criminal records have been deported to El Salvador. The U.S. government paid the Salvadoran government $6 million to keep them in a high-security prison.

The report was delayed by months from its usual release date. The final report is shorter than previous years.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners, and to be more responsive to the underlying legislative mandate and aligned to the administration’s executive order,” a State Department summary says.

Last year’s report criticized Israel for alleged human rights abuses following the October 2023 attack and abductions at a music festival. They have included lack of food aid in Gaza and bombings that have killed thousands of civilians.

The report said Israel’s war in Gaza “displaced the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza, and resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis.”

This year’s State Department report largely omits any criticisms of Israel.

Some of the condemnations in the 2025 report are directed at opponents of conservative government leaders.

One example is Brazil, where its liberal president encouraged a criminal trial of his opponent, former President Jair Bolsonaro, on charges of trying to overturn the last election. Trump is a supporter of Bolsonaro.

The State Department report says Brazil’s current leaders are “disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees.”

Trump has imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil’s imports into the United States.

The South Africa section of the report says the country enacted “substantially worrying” legislation that allows “land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” The country’s main minority refers to White people.

Trump agreed shortly after he was inaugurated this year to give refugee status to white South African farmers who want to emigrate to the United States.

Critics of the report say it was influenced this year by Trump’s political preferences.

“The outcome is a much-abbreviated product that is more reflective of a Soviet propaganda release than of a democratic system,” said Josh Paul, a former State Department official.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/state-department-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:45.807721

The governor made the announcement during a news conference outside the facility, which is listed as temporarily closed on the Florida Department of Corrections website.

The facility will be the second in the state, after the Everglades facility that opened in July.

Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said the unit will accommodate 1,310 beds and hold up to 2,000 people in a temporary capacity.

“This is definitely the right decision to do. We are going to be able to fulfill, utilize these resources. The demand is there and our guys are ready, willing, and able to help our federal partners in this really, really important mission,” DeSantis said.

The correctional institute is situated about 50 miles north of Gainesville and 50 miles west of Jacksonville.

Guthrie said the facility will provide the same services offered at the Everglades detention facility, including three meals per day, pharmacy, access to recreation yards, legal and clergy services, laundry, and “everything that is required under federal or state law.”

The facility is 15 minutes away from the Lake City airport, which DeSantis said “is good, something that will make a difference.”

“This will be operational soon. It’s not going to take forever but we’re also not rushing to do it right this day. They’re doing what they need to do to get it done in all deliberate speed,” DeSantis said.

DeSantis said the projects, this one and the Everglades detention facility combined, will come under budget of what the federal government will reimburse.

The project will cost $6 million to build out, DeSantis said, and would have cost “a lot more” if done at Camp Blanding, the Florida National Guard base in Starke previously proposed as the next immigrant deportation facility in the state.

The Baker site was “very appealing” because it requires “a lot less in standing up than we would at Blanding and far less than we had to do at Alligator Alcatraz,” he said

The DeSantis administration has dubbed it “Deportation Depot,” taking on another alliterative name like the Everglades detention facility dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

The National Guard said it will activate 200 additional guardsmen this month at 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities across Florida.

Guardsmen will “support emerging requirements here in Baker County and other locations across the state as directed by the governor,” Major General John D. Haas said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida commented on the new project.

“DeSantis is pushing to open yet another inhumane immigration detention center — this one with capacity for 1,300 people — just miles from Baker County Detention Center, a facility infamous for human rights violations, sexual abuse, and repeated lawsuits,” the organization said in an email to the Florida Phoenix.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit alleging mistreatment against an immigrant in ICE custody at a Baker County facility in 2023.

“Floridians’ taxpayer dollars shouldn’t fund Trump’s overreaching and inhumane mass deportation agenda,” the ACLU said.

Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried reacted to the facility, and the financial implications of such facilities, Thursday in a news release.

“These inhumane facilities reward massive, taxpayer-funded no-bid contracts to politically connected businesses and corporate elite donors. DeSantis is funneling millions of tax dollars from the working and middle class to fill the pockets of the wealthy at the expense of immigrants who have come to our State seeking a better life for their families,” Fried said.

“Floridians want their tax dollars going toward real solutions like fixing the insurance crisis, expanding Medicaid, funding public schools, and building affordable housing, not lining the pockets of corporate donors getting rich off of detention camps.”

Democratic State Rep. Anna Eskamani suggested via social media that the second facility “is very likely motivated by the risk of the Everglades Immigration Detention Camp closing via court order.”

That facility has been subject of legal disputes for environmental impacts.

The annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, also known simply as the Human Rights Reports, were created by legislation passed in the 1970s. Since the first reports were published in 1977, they have anchored the United States’ efforts—imperfect yet enduring—to integrate human rights into its foreign policy. By methodically assessing countries around the world according to the standards set forth in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international agreements, and by improving gradually to capture emerging threats and incorporate more civil society perspectives, the reports came to be one of the world’s most widely trusted resources on human rights issues.

The Human Rights Reports are used in a variety of ways by a range of different consumers. They have shaped foreign and security assistance decisions by Congress, informed immigration cases and asylum adjudications, guided US diplomacy, and set global standards for the protection of human rights. They are said to be the most downloaded items on the State Department website.

What is different about the 2025 reports?

The latest reports, covering the 2024 calendar year, risk dramatically curtailing the credibility and legacy of this highly regarded endeavor. Critical sections are omitted, including but not limited to those on freedom of peaceful assembly and association, election abuses and irregularities, corruption in government, and protections for y and other vulnerable groups. This year’s reports also exclude sections related to prison conditions, the right to a fair trial, and retribution against human rights defenders—all at a time when the State Department estimates that there are more than one million political prisoners worldwide.

The country reports themselves are effectively cut by more than half in length, offering only isolated examples of human rights violations in each section, rather than the traditionally robust documentation of the year’s developments. This obscures trends and patterns of repeated abuses, making it easier for authoritarian regimes to evade accountability by claiming that the few cited violations are rare in practice or taken out of context.

The topical sections that remain have other problems. While reporting on transnational repression, for instance, is statutorily required by Congress and has therefore been nominally retained, some reports include unrelated information in this section, many lack specificity, and others omit notable incidents or phenomena from the year, such as physical attacks on Nicaraguan and Venezuelan exiles living in Costa Rica and Chile

Similarly, while the reports still cover freedom of expression online, the deletion of the sections on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association mean the loss of important information on other dimensions of internet freedom and human rights: Political dissidents, protest leaders, and civic activists often use digital tools to collaborate and organize, and repressive regimes consequently restrict and punish their online engagement. dynamics and their implications may now be less visible.

Negative consequences of diminished reporting

Many of the rights and freedoms that have been dropped from the new reports are explicitly recognized in the US constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the United States has ratified. Reducing the scope of these reports will damage the United States’ global and leadership on human rights, weaken a proven instrument for advancing freedom and democracy, and deprive policymakers, business leaders, advocates, historians, and the global public of essential context.

f the United States stops holding all countries to an established international standard through consistent, comprehensive documentation, it undermines the legitimacy of the international human rights framework and suggests that rights can be customized and deployed by each global power according to its own specific interests. It would become more difficult to argue that universal human rights are actually universal.

Suggesting that some rights are less important than others would certainly play into the hands of the United States’ authoritarian adversaries. The regime in Beijing, for example, routinely works to erode the legal and normative framework that protects fundamental freedoms around the world, particularly at the United Nations and other multilateral organizations, by promoting the primacy of economic development and social stability over civil liberties and political rights—most importantly the right to choose one’s own leaders through competitive elections.

Indeed, the State Department’s decision to eliminate coverage of electoral violations comes at an incredibly inopportune time. Voters in more than 60 countries went to the polls last year in what was hailed as a “global year of elections.” In 2025, there will be more than 100 elections in countries and territories around the world.

The many institutional consumers of the State Department’s reports will also suffer from their diminishment. US and international businesses have often used information contained in the reports to develop their risk assessments and related strategic decisions. Similarly, US and international government officials regularly relied on them to help inform policy decisions. In the last Congress, for example, senators and representatives cited the State Department reports in legislation 76 times. ly cited the Human Rights Reports during his time in the Senate, calling them a “crucial instrument in exposing human rights violations around the world.”

Such consumers will still be able to turn to an array of civil society analysis and documentation, but few nongovernmental organizations can match the steady congressional funding, the embassy resources, and the overall staffing that stood behind the State Department’s product. One of the reports’ great benefits was their compilation of evidence from a variety of civil society sources. Consumers will now have to do this work on their own, and there may be fewer sources available to them: Many of the organizations cited in the Human Rights Reports covering 2024 have dramatically scaled back their operations due to disruptions in their federal funding this year.

Remedies and resilience

We strongly urge Congress and the State Department to restore their tradition of robust and comprehensive human rights reports without delay. Consistent US leadership in this domain is simply irreplaceable. At the same time, the recent changes have underscored the urgent need for other democratic governments and private donors to step forward and reinforce the broader global infrastructure of human rights reporting, reducing its reliance on any single product or funder.

Continued access to accurate reporting will remain critical for years to come, not just for government officials, businesses, and academic researchers, but also for activists and dissidents seeking to exercise their fundamental rights and hold their governments accountable for violations when necessary.

will strive to maintain their own well-established records of human rights reporting. But when one is confronted with the threats, lies, propaganda, and censorship of brutal regimes like those in China, Russia, and Iran, there is no substitute for the power and authority of a major democracy that is willing to studiously document the facts on the ground and hold them up against widely recognized international standards. The United States, through its State Department reports, has long played this role.

WASHINGTON (AP) | The Trump administration on Aug. 14 released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”",https://watermarkonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250304_Donald_Trump_at_Joint_Session_of_Congress_insert_2_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:51.755286

Noem in a press conference in Los Angeles earlier this year claimed that the Trump administration was attempting to “liberate” the city from Newsom’s and Mayor Karen Bass’s leadership.","Masked and armed federal agents made arrests outside of a Los Angeles museum in which Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) Thursday was announcing plans to redraw the state’s congressional map to offset the GOP’s redistricting efforts in Texas.

The aggressive police operation directly outside the press conference appeared to be an attempt at intimidation, the governor’s office said.

“Where are we? At the Democracy Center,” Newsom said, referring to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. “And right outside, at this exact moment, are dozens and dozens of ICE agents.”

“You think it’s coincidental?” Newsom asked. “Donald Trump and his minions decided, coincidentally or not, that this was a location to advance ICE arrests.”

“Wake up, America,” the governor said. “This is a serious moment.”

Video of the raid showed dozens of Border Patrol agents wearing body armor and masks outside the museum. Some were armed with long rifles and handguns.

Gregory Bovino, U.S. Border Patrol El Centro sector chief, claimed the agents were conducting the operation because unnamed “politicians” failed to make the city safe.

“We’re here making Los Angeles a safer place. Since we don’t have politicians that will do that, we’ll do that ourselves,” Bovino said.

Bovino has a history of criticizing California’s elected officials despite being a law enforcement agent.

In a trial over President Donald Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles, an Army major general revealed earlier this week that Bovino questioned his loyalty to the country after the commander objected to a request for military assistance for an immigration raid on a public park.

On Fox News Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that the operation was planned in advance and that federal law enforcement agencies had information that “illegal criminals” would be in the area.

Noem in a press conference in Los Angeles earlier this year claimed that the Trump administration was attempting to “liberate” the city from Newsom’s and Mayor Karen Bass’s leadership.

“We are not going away,” Noem said. “We are staying here to liberate the city from socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”

During that same press conference, federal agents arrested Sen. Alex Padilla, one of the state’s Democratic U.S. senators, after he attempted to ask Noem a question.

In a follow-up press conference Thursday, Newsom said the immigration operation was “pretty sick and pathetic” and was indicative of “the authoritarian tendencies of the president.”

“As I said a moment ago, wake up, America. You will not have a country if he rigs this election,” Newsom said, referring to the 2026 midterms.

American Oversight’s FOIA requests seek records detailing the number of people detained at these facilities, policies and practices governing detention conditions, and inspection reports.
“ICE detention facilities are notorious for secrecy, but when people’s rights, safety, and freedom are at stake, the public deserves timely transparency,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight.
Those records, as well as others responsive to American Oversight’s request, could be highly relevant to pending motions for preliminary relief in both Barco Mercado and Neguse v. ICE.
American Oversight’s appeal argues that expedited processing is necessary both because there is an urgency to inform the public, and because the government’s own actions have affected the public’s confidence about its treatment of detainees at ICE detention facilities.","Today, American Oversight filed an administrative appeal challenging the Department of Homeland Security’s refusal to expedite the release of records sought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) concerning Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention facilities in New York City, including the field office at 26 Federal Plaza.

The appeal follows a federal judge’s order on Tuesday blocking the Trump administration from using 26 Federal Plaza to hold immigrants facing deportation, after a lawyer for the administration conceded in a separate lawsuit that those detained by ICE at the facility lacked basic services — including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication, and more than two meals per day.

American Oversight’s FOIA requests seek records detailing the number of people detained at these facilities, policies and practices governing detention conditions, and inspection reports. The requested records are of urgent public concern: there has been significant national media and congressional interest about this issue, and the records could help answer questions that have arisen in multiple ongoing federal lawsuits, including a suit brought by twelve members of Congress blocked from conducting lawful oversight of federal immigration detention facilities.

“ICE detention facilities are notorious for secrecy, but when people’s rights, safety, and freedom are at stake, the public deserves timely transparency,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “Despite the Trump administration’s own admission that conditions in these facilities are deplorable, ICE has flat-out refused to acknowledge the public’s pressing need to know — a choice that speaks volumes about their willful disregard for transparency. This isn’t an inability to recognize the human cost of their policies; it’s a deliberate rejection of it, paired with a calculated effort to obscure the truth. By slow-walking the release of these records, the government is not only keeping the public in the dark — it’s depriving courts and Congress of information that could shape urgent decisions.”

In Barco Mercado v. Noem, a federal district court in New York City directly asked government counsel about the existence of records that American Oversight’s FOIA request seeks — records that the government admitted exist, and that it has custody of. Those records, as well as others responsive to American Oversight’s request, could be highly relevant to pending motions for preliminary relief in both Barco Mercado and Neguse v. ICE.

Under the government’s standard FOIA timelines, the public may not see these records until long after the courts rule in these high-profile cases. American Oversight’s appeal argues that expedited processing is necessary both because there is an urgency to inform the public, and because the government’s own actions have affected the public’s confidence about its treatment of detainees at ICE detention facilities. Should expedited processing be granted, it will allow the public, Congress, and the courts to evaluate ICE’s actions — and not be forced to rely on the agency’s public statements.",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-design-3-3.png,N,,2025-08-14 17:57:01.470194

Access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities is restricted, internal oversight agencies have been hollowed out, and credible information about conditions inside is scarce. Yet reports that have emerged, some from those who have recently been deported, tell a troubling story echoing the darkest moments of recent U.S. immigration history.

In late July and early August, researchers from WOLA and the Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC) set out to pierce this “black box” by visiting cities in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico that are key deportation hubs. There, they interviewed deported migrants, service providers, advocates, experts, and government officials to learn what they are hearing about conditions in U.S. detention.

The findings are disturbing. They point to a resurgence of family separations, cruel treatment, miserable, unhealthy conditions, and deportation processes that violate migrants’ rights and dignity. With transparency mechanisms dismantled, these abuses are happening out of public view.

In this episode, host Adam Isacson talks with two colleagues from WRC with whom he traveled:

Zain Lakhani, WRC’s director of Migrant Rights and Justice.

Diana Flórez, a consultant to WRC, an attorney and expert on gender, transitional justice, development, and peacebuilding.

During their travels, Isacson, Lakhani, and Flórez shared photos and initial findings in four “dispatches” published to our organizations’ websites, from Honduras, Guatemala, Tapachula, and Ciudad Juárez.

We heard consistent accounts of:

Family separations: A larger number than expected of parents deported without U.S. citizen children, often without being given the choice of being removed with them. The crisis is approaching the scale of the “zero tolerance” family separations that shocked the nation in 2018.

Inhumane conditions: Overcrowded cells, lack of medical care, and verbal and physical abuse by guards.

Threats to the health of pregnant and lactating women and their children: Insufficient and poor-quality food, difficulty in obtaining medical attention, and even being forced to sleep on floors. (The podcast refers to a July 30 report on abuse in detention, especially of pregnant women and children, by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia).)

Targeting of vulnerable populations: Harassment of LGBTQ+ individuals, especially trans individuals who are now detained with the gender to which they were assigned at birth.

As Lakhani notes, “Historically… we were able to enter detention centers and visit them and speak with migrants,” but “now we’re seeing the deliberate creation of a black box.”

We hope that the WOLA–WRC delegation’s findings will guide future, more intensive on-the-ground research enabling advocates to refer egregious abuses requiring legal action, build a rigorous archive of known cases, and inform public opinion and policymakers.",https://www.wola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_6831.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 15:57:16.014591

Ciaramella, Joe Lancaster, Emma Camp, Jack Nicastro, Veronique de Rugy, Robby Soave",,,,,https://reason.com/2025/08/13/cbp-is-deporting-cruise-ship-crew-over-child-pornography-allegations-without-evidence/,"While CBP has arrested and charged several cruise ship employees for child pornography in targeted operations earlier this year and last year, advocates say these cases in recent months have been different.
For Maria, being a room attendant on a cruise ship was a perfect job.
Marcelo Morales, one of those former crew members, told the Business Mirror that CBP agents boarded the Sunshine on May 30.
Morales was one of nine crew members arrested, held in detention, and then put on a flight back to Manila.
Victory Cruise Lines did not respond to a request for comment.","When Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents marched the housekeeper down the gangplank of the Victory I cruise ship in the Port of Detroit on the morning of July 11, she didn't know what was wrong, but she was confident it would get sorted out.

The crew member, originally from South America, had worked for 20 years on smaller cruise ships plying the Great Lakes. She split her time between her home country, where her family still lives, and the Great Lakes region, where she had a job she loved and a partner. She says that over the years, her respect for America and its dedication to the rule of law had grown.

It wasn't until a CBP agent told her to put her hands behind her back and she felt the cuffs click around her wrists that a horrible feeling washed over her, and she realized she may have been mistaken about something very, very important.

""When I was handcuffed, all that respect that had been building up for 20 years disappeared,"" says the former crew member, who requested anonymity.

Why the woman—whom Reason is calling ""Maria"" to protect her privacy—was being arrested would shock her even more when she eventually found out.

Maria is one of more than an estimated 100 cruise ship crew members who have been summarily deported and had their work visas revoked in recent months based on unsubstantiated allegations by CBP agents of possessing or viewing child pornography.

According to interviews, advocacy groups, and other news reports, CBP agents are boarding cruise ships with a list of targets and seizing their cell phones, laptops, and electronics. The crew members are handcuffed and detained. CBP agents then accuse them of having viewed or posted child pornography and pressure them to sign an admission, which includes a voluntary revocation of their C1/D visa (a joint crewmember and transit visa). The detainees are not shown the evidence against them or allowed legal representation.

The removals—which have occurred at ports in the Great Lakes region, Norfolk, Virginia, and Florida—have attracted limited outside attention, but they have caused fear and confusion in the cruise ship industry, which heavily relies on international crews.

One of the countries that supplies the most sailors to the cruise industry is the Philippines. It's unknown how many seafarers have been deported off cruise ships in recent months, but two Filipino advocacy groups, the National Federation of Filipino American Associations (NaFFAA) and the Pilipino Workers Center (PWC), say more than 100 Filipino sailors have been arrested, deported, and had their work visas revoked since June.

While CBP has arrested and charged several cruise ship employees for child pornography in targeted operations earlier this year and last year, advocates say these cases in recent months have been different.

""There's no evidence. There's no charges being filed. There's no convictions,"" says PWC executive director Aquilina Soriano Versoza. ""And then they're just having their visas revoked.""

NaFFAA National President Ryan Namata said in a press release that the organization is ""concerned by recent reports of Filipino seafarers being deported without clear explanation.""

""While we recognize the importance of upholding immigration laws, it is equally important to ensure that every individual is treated with dignity and in accordance with due process,"" Namata continued.

The NaFAA and PWC have demanded clarification and transparency from federal authorities, and the office of Rep. Bobby Scott (D–Va.) also launched an investigation. However, the CBP has refused to release any more details.

""CBP is involved in an ongoing operation,"" a CBP spokesperson said in response to a request for comment. ""Due to the nature of this operation, we are unable to provide further details at this time.""

A summary arrest, detention, and deportation under an accusation of possessing or viewing child pornography carries significant due process concerns, and also a devastating financial and reputational impact. A person whose C1/D crewmember visa is revoked cannot reapply for another one for 10 years.

""For these people who have worked as crew, and see that as their livelihood and their way of supporting their families, that's the kiss of death in that profession,"" says one individual in the cruise industry.

For Maria, being a room attendant on a cruise ship was a perfect job. ""I love that job,"" she says. ""My passion is to help others, to serve."" She says she turned down opportunities to move to a supervisor position because she liked it so much.

On the morning of July 11, she says she was bringing two carafes to a guest room when she was approached by CBP officers. Once they confirmed her identity, the officers took her phone and other electronics and put them in plastic evidence bags.

After she was marched off the ship and handcuffed, Maria was taken to a temporary detention area with seven other Victory I crew members, all of the rest of them Filipino. She says none of them had been told why they had been arrested.

Then, one by one, they were called into a room where a CBP officer interrogated them. Maria says the officer accused her of posting a photo on her Facebook page in 2018 of an 11-year-old boy with his penis exposed.

""How come I would post something like that when I have two daughters?"" Maria says she asked the CBP agent.

And if she had posted such a photo, she wondered, why had she been repeatedly allowed in and out of the country in the years since? She also says she demanded to see the post in question, but the officer refused.

""He said, 'You don't have rights, and I don't need to explain it to you,'"" Maria recalls.

Soriano Versoza says the details are ""very consistent"" across the cases of Filipino sailors that the PWC has talked to.

""They're all individually being interrogated, and they're being accused of having watched or possessed child pornography. They will open up their phones, and CBP will go through all of their phones and not find anything. [CBP] might tell them, 'Oh, well we have evidence here that back in 2008 there was something,'"" she says.

That evidence is never shown to the accused, but CBP officers then attempt to get detainees to sign admissions and other documents.

The Business Mirror, a news outlet in the Philippines, reported in July on the removal and deportation of Filipino seafarers from the Carnival Sunshine cruise ship at the Port of Norfolk, Virginia.

Marcelo Morales, one of those former crew members, told the Business Mirror that CBP agents boarded the Sunshine on May 30.

""They confiscated my cellphone and checked everything thoroughly,"" Morales said. ""After the official search, they asked if I had viewed child pornography. I denied the accusation, and after they found nothing, I was cleared and allowed to return to the vessel—no charges, no citation, not even a warning.""

But CBP officers boarded the ship again in Norfolk on June 28, accused Morales of watching child sexual abuse material, and placed him under arrest.

""No new evidence was shown. They didn't search my phone again—they just placed it in a small transparent envelope and took me,"" he said.

Morales was one of nine crew members arrested, held in detention, and then put on a flight back to Manila. The Business Mirror reported that 18 Filipino seafarers were deported from the Carnival Sunshine between February and the end of July.

""We were treated like criminals. We were not fed, we had no water. We are crying. We want justice for what was done to us,"" Morales said.

Back in detention at the Port of Detroit, Maria refused to sign anything. She was returned to the main holding area, where she says agents took her fingerprints and collected a mouth swab from her, likely for a DNA sample.

In the middle of the night, she says the seven other Filipino crew members who'd been detained with her were handcuffed and driven to the airport to be flown out of the country.

""I cry. I cry,"" Maria says. ""My colleagues tell me, 'Momma, be strong. We love you.' When I saw them be moved out of the detention place, it was the hardest thing. Just like I was innocent, they were innocent. We came with valid visas, medical, everything valid.""

The next morning, Maria was driven to the Detroit airport and marched in handcuffs through a terminal of passengers to a flight back to her home country.

""When I was going to this security place with the handcuffs and chain on my belly, it was the worst thing,"" Maria says.

Maria and the other deported seafarers represented more than 10 percent of the Victory I's overall crew. It seems statistically unlikely that so many of the Victory I's crew, all of whom were vetted by their respective governments and the U.S. government before being issued crewmember visas, were consumers of child pornography.

In addition to the 18 crew members of the Carnival Sunshine, the PWC and NaFFAA say as many as 80 Filipino crewmembers from Carnival's Mardi Gras and Vista cruise liners were deported in April and May.

In the Great Lakes, media outlets reported that 13 crew members were removed and deported from the Victory I and Victory II in July, along with 16 crew members from the Viking Octantis and Viking Polaris, and an unknown number from Pearl Seas Cruises.

Soriano Versoza notes that, even though international crew members don't live in the U.S.—and usually remain aboard the ship in U.S. ports—their removals will still count toward CBP's overall number of deportations.

""We really think that this is a part of the current administration trying to boost up its numbers of deportations as it's already claimed that it's trying to reach these 3,000-a-day quotas,"" she says.

While it may be an easy way to juice the agency's deportation numbers, the removals and visa revocations are destroying the livelihoods of former crew members.

Soriano Versoza says that once seafarers arrive back in the Philippines, they're finding out that, in addition to being banned from desirable U.S. cruise routes, they're blacklisted altogether by the agencies that hire sailors for major cruise companies.

""There are a few where they're being placed, having some options of just Asia routes,"" Soriano Versoza says. ""But overwhelmingly, the workers that we've been talking to, the majority of the cruise ships like Royal Caribbean and Carnival are just not rehiring them at all.""

To add insult to injury, Maria says that when she received her final paycheck, it was docked $450 for the cost of her repatriation flight.

""I always have a big respect for the U.S., but I'm hurt,"" she says. ""I'm hurt from the way things are going on, for innocent people, working, giving their life, apart from their family.""

Maria says she's been overwhelmed with how to begin rebuilding her life with such an awful accusation hanging over her head.

""I don't sit with my kids and explain, because I can't look in their faces, and I feel ashamed,"" she says. ""Mentally, I feel destroyed. I don't want to do nothing. I passed into the worst time in my life.""

She credits her faith in God for giving her the strength to carry on. ""I'm holding onto Him,"" she says. ""That's why I'm still alive.""

Ricci Levy, the president and CEO of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, a group that advocates for sexual freedom, says that what's happening to Maria and other crew members is ""a fundamental violation of due process and human rights.""

""They are being accused of one of the most stigmatizing crimes imaginable without being shown evidence, given legal counsel, or afforded a fair hearing,"" Levy says. ""These summary deportations and visa revocations not only destroy livelihoods—they weaponize accusation as punishment.""

Victory Cruise Lines did not respond to a request for comment. However, in a statement to other media outlets reporting on the raids, John Waggoner, the founder and chairman of Victory, said: ""We are actively cooperating with federal authorities to clarify the circumstances, and my priority is always our crew and the experience for our guests. We wish to thank federal, state and local representatives across the Great Lakes for their prompt and continued attention to this matter.""

Carnival, Viking, and Celebrity cruise lines did not respond to requests for comment.

In a press release, Scott said his office is investigating. ""Our nation was founded on the fundamental principles of due process,"" Scott said. ""Under our Constitution, everyone is entitled to due process regardless of citizenship or immigration status.""

The removals have also caught the attention of members of Congress in the Great Lakes.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/08/cbp-cruise-ships.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 16:56:33.406215
,Policy,2025-08-14 17:52:23+00:00,American Immigration Council,"DACA Recipients Keep Getting Detained, Despite Protections",Not Available,,,,,https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/daca-detained-despite-protections/,"DACA recipient Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago was detained while boarding a flight for a work trip out of El Paso, Texas.
Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf and mute DACA recipient, was detained during a raid at his work site.
Right now, we don’t have clarity on why certain DACA recipients are being targeted for detention.
We cannot keep treating DACA recipients like a temporary problem to be managed every few years.
And DACA recipients deserve to wake up without wondering if today is the day it all disappears.","Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin recently told NBC News that “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.” Then she went further: any DACA recipient may be detained and deported, and urged them to self-deport.

DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a U.S. immigration policy designed to provide work authorization and temporary protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. DACA is not a permanent legal status but rather an exercise of prosecutorial discretion that the US government — across both political parties — has supported for decades to protect many young immigrants from detention and deportation.

Every day, there is a new immigration headline. A new rumor to chase down. A new rule to memorize before it changes again. It’s relentless. It’s exhausting. And the instability is by design. For some, these headlines are just noise. For DACA recipients, they’re a nightmare realized. On the ground, words echoed by administration officials are already affecting communities — showing up in arrests at airports, workplaces, and outside corner stores.

DACA recipient Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago was detained while boarding a flight for a work trip out of El Paso, Texas. Her arrest came without a warrant, and Santiago has now been transferred to a federal immigration processing center, where her status in the country remains uncertain.

Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf and mute DACA recipient, was detained during a raid at his work site. When he tried to identify himself, officers confiscated the tools he relied on to communicate. Javier spent nearly a month in an immigration detention center in El Paso, cut off from his attorney and family. To add insult to injury, Javier was given paperwork in Spanish— a language he cannot read.

Jose Valdovinos was detained outside a Circle K, while in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by his wife. When his wife asked why Jose was being detained, officers told her, “DACA is no longer considered a legal status in the U.S.” She reminded them that he had a work permit and was employed. “It doesn’t matter,” the agents said, before opening the car door and taking him away.

Right now, we don’t have clarity on why certain DACA recipients are being targeted for detention. We don’t know if these detentions are isolated, the start of a broader shift, or simply the result of mixed messages filtering down to local enforcement. What we do know is that the gap between what’s on paper and what’s happening in real life is widening — and DACA recipients are the ones paying the price.

It’s terrifying. And even though I am no longer a DACA recipient, the fear still hits me like a punch to the chest. There’s no way to rewire my brain away from those fears. If I’m scared, I can’t imagine how my friends, my family, and my community who are still part of the policy feel.

I know the quiet dread that seeps into every milestone. The way you learn to celebrate with one eye on the clock, waiting for it to run out. The fear doesn’t start with the policy memo — it starts the moment someone in power says something reckless into a microphone, knowing the ripple will reach long before the law ever does.

When I was a kid in my immigrant household, I was the one expected to have the answers. Multilingualism became my bridge — first for my parents, then my extended family, then my friends, and eventually my community. I was the one who knew how to fill out the forms, call the offices, and explain the rules. Even now, my inbox is full of messages from people asking, “What’s going to happen to us?” And for the first time in years, around the current news on DACA, I can’t give them an honest answer.

For Xochitl, Javier, and Jose, the promises made to them were never built to last; DACA was never meant to be permanent, but it allowed people temporary protections until a more permanent pathway could be created. It gave people enough stability to plant roots, raise families, and contribute openly without looking over their shoulders every second. When you’ve built your life from table scraps, you learn how to stretch them into meals; now, even those scraps feel like they’re slipping away.

I survived that uncertainty. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. And right now — as the courts stall, Congress hides behind gridlock, and the Trump administration sends mixed signals — people’s lives are hanging in the balance. In a country where free speech can be weaponized against entire communities, no one should be surprised that enforcement is expanding to those with “protections.”

Permanent protections aren’t optional anymore. They are the only way to end this cycle of fear and uncertainty. Every day without them is another day where someone risks losing their job, their home, or their freedom. We cannot keep treating DACA recipients like a temporary problem to be managed every few years. That’s not just bad policy; it’s cruel.

The claim, the Department of Homeland Security said, is based on a report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which describes itself as a “low immigration” advocate.
“If this is the case, then our estimate of illegal immigrants based on the survey may be overstating the decline in their actual numbers.
Further, our estimate of legal immigrants based on administrative data through July of 2025 is incomplete, further increasing uncertainty of our estimate of illegal immigrants.
The 1.6 million estimate from CIS would also represent a sharp jump from the Department of Homeland Security’s previously released figures, as it has touted both deportations and voluntary departures.","Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Thursday that the U.S. now has 1.6 million fewer illegal immigrants since the start of the Trump administration – a claim based on information from a restrictionist immigration group that said their own estimate may be overstated.

“In less than 200 days, 1.6 MILLION illegal immigrants have left the United States population. This is massive. This means safer streets, taxpayer savings, pressure off of schools and hospital services and better job opportunities for Americans,” Noem wrote in a social media post thanking President Trump.

The claim, the Department of Homeland Security said, is based on a report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), which describes itself as a “low immigration” advocate.

CIS identified several “caveats” to its estimate, which it said is based on immigrants’ willingness to respond to the Current Population Survey (CPS) crafted by the Census Bureau and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which CIS said “does not specifically identify illegal immigrants.”

“Given the recent stepped-up enforcement efforts, it is possible that immigrants have become more reluctant to respond to the CPS,” the report states.

“If this is the case, then our estimate of illegal immigrants based on the survey may be overstating the decline in their actual numbers. Further, our estimate of legal immigrants based on administrative data through July of 2025 is incomplete, further increasing uncertainty of our estimate of illegal immigrants. All this should be kept in mind when interpreting the figures presented here.”

Estimates of the number of people unlawfully living in the U.S. typically hover around 13 million.

The 1.6 million estimate from CIS would also represent a sharp jump from the Department of Homeland Security’s previously released figures, as it has touted both deportations and voluntary departures.

The Trump administration said in April that it had deported 135,000 people, but that figure has also come under scrutiny, with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) saying the figures were “gross exaggerations” and that deportation figures at the time were actually around 72,000.

TRAC also said immigration judges this year have ordered just more than 360,000 people to be deported, though it’s unclear when those removals will be carried out.

The Trump administration has also started new programs encouraging immigrants to leave the country, offering a $1,000 stipend to those who register to leave through the CBP Home App, a redesign of an app started under former President Biden allowing migrants to request an appointment to seek asylum.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/nomekristi_043025gn02_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-14 13:57:25.973938

But even if you are caught up at an ICE checkpoint or questioned by federal agents—or if you’re a bystander—you have rights.
Once you do, staying silent means you don’t need to discuss your immigration status.
Like the pedestrians who held up signs warning drivers of the upcoming ICE checkpoint, you’re allowed to alert people nearby about the presence of law enforcement, Hopkins says.","ICE agents were pulling over cars on 14th Street, Northwest, just north of the U Street corridor on Wednesday night, asking about immigration status and detaining at least two drivers. DC police officers on the scene said the checkpoint was focused on traffic safety and “status,” but ICE and Homeland Security Investigations agents wouldn’t say a word. Many covered their faces with neck gaiters.

The scene was shocking. Pedestrians at the busy intersection staged an impromptu protest, taunting agents, shouting “Go home fascists!” and making signs to warn drivers away. But amid the Trump administration’s ramping up of federal law enforcement presence in DC to fight a supposed crime crisis, this could become a regular occurrence for at least the next month.

Local police are subject to more accountability than federal forces if they violate the constitution. But even if you are caught up at an ICE checkpoint or questioned by federal agents—or if you’re a bystander—you have rights.

“We’re in this moment where it’s like uncharted waters,” says Monica Hopkins, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of DC. “But your rights are your rights regardless of your citizenship status.”

Whether you’re a citizen or not, you have the right to remain silent if you’re stopped by federal agents— but you must verbally invoke it. Once you do, staying silent means you don’t need to discuss your immigration status. You can ask “Am I free to leave?” and do so calmly if the answer is yes.

Anyone detained by DC police has the right to an attorney. With ICE, the government doesn’t need to provide you with a lawyer, but you do have the right to consult with one. If you’re pulled over, you may be required to show your license, registration, and proof of insurance. If you’re not a citizen, you must show your immigration papers to an agent on request if you have them. However, you can refuse a search of yourself or your vehicle if there is no judicial warrant.

For non-citizens already on ICE’s radar, options are slim. Genevieve Augustin, legal director at the DC immigrant resource center CARECEN, says people should cooperate by giving their names and IDs, but not passports. But she says ICE has access to biometric information and can establish probable cause for arrest in a number of ways, so what’s most important for undocumented people is to have a plan in case of detainment.

“We have to be realistic about this,” Augustin says. “Although they have rights, at the end of the day, if they’re on ICE’s radar, there’s a good chance it’ll end up in an arrest, especially outside of their home. Once that happens, fighting their cases from scratch from custody is going to be very difficult.”

If you’re a bystander and want to video an ICE interaction or voice your opposition, you have the right to do both— as long as you don’t interfere. Like the pedestrians who held up signs warning drivers of the upcoming ICE checkpoint, you’re allowed to alert people nearby about the presence of law enforcement, Hopkins says.

But active civil disobedience, like yelling at or standing in front of officers, can have consequences. The Justice Department employee who threw a Subway sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer this week was fired after he was charged with felony assault.

“You should invoke your rights, but with any sort of interaction, make sure to not escalate by getting into an argument,” Hopkins says. “The priority is: people should keep themselves safe, and complain later.”",https://www.washingtonian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-agent-Evy-Mages.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 16:56:38.592543

It’s a great day to reaffirm the strong ties and bonds of cooperation, partnership, and alliance between the United States and the Government of Paraguay – the nation of Paraguay – that I visited as a Senator just a couple of months ago —

FOREIGN MINISTER RAMÍREZ: Yes, exactly.

SECRETARY RUBIO: — and we talked quite a bit and interact. And this is just another example of cooperation and the ability to work together to prevent something that we – both countries are very concerned about, and that is illegal and irregular migration, which poses a national security threat. And so the ability to work together on this in partnership is extraordinary. And I want to thank the foreign minister for being here today. I want to thank my friend, the President – (in Spanish) – I was going to say President Peña, who’s a great, strong partner and ally of the United States. And we’re very happy to be signing this here today along with our partners from the Department of Homeland Security.

(In Spanish.) Thank you for being here.

FOREIGN MINISTER RAMÍREZ: Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary Rubio. You are a very close friend of our government, of our country. You have been the only one after 50 years of Senator visiting Paraguay and that represents a very important alliance that we are developing.

Today this agreement represent our deep engagement with our government to work not only on migration program but also in security. We are working in trade. We are working on – as well as on investment. We are working in security cooperation, and that represent the (inaudible) agenda, the bilateral agenda. It means the diversify of the alliance that we have as Paraguay Government with the United States Government and personally with you, Secretary, is amazing to work and cooperate with all your staff here as well. Really is a pleasure to me. Thank you for hosting us for this meeting.

And the homeland security secretary, really, we appreciate very much this agreement that represent the opportunity to work in several issues. We were discussing about the visa waiver. We are discussing about our common and shared values and principles – democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law, that represent our principles and values shared. Thank you. Thank you so much.

SECRETARY RUBIO: Thank you.

DEPUTY SECRETARY EDGAR: Yeah. First of all, Minister Ramírez and Secretary Rubio, thank you so much for the diplomacy, being able to help us. The Secretary and myself have been very focused on establishing safe third country agreements within Latin America, South America, and even in Africa. So this has been a big step for us. We’re very appreciative of the opportunity to be able to work with you.

Like you said, we did talk a little bit kind of behind the scenes about the Visa Waiver Program and some of the different programs that are out there, where we work together. And we are very much appreciative of everything that Paraguay is doing. We look at Paraguay as a law enforcement and border security partner. You guys have been a great partner, and this is a great step.

The American asylum system is one that has been significantly abused in the previous administration. And being able to sign an agreement like this really starts to loosen the burden within Homeland Security and our ability to be able to process and provide the asylum process to people that are actually deserving of it and go through the process. So we just want to thank you for what you’re doing. We want to thank you for your partnership.

Secretary, we just think everything that you do and with your team – we’re always appreciative. Thank you.

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.)

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.)

The question, if I may in English, is just asking about whether U.S. forces will be involved in the Western Hemisphere and going after drug traffickers and drug trafficking networks. There are designated narco-terrorist groups operating in the region. Some of them utilizing international airspace, international waters to transit poison into the United States. And those groups will be confronted. The President has made that clear from the time he has operated.

In specific, the question was about the Cartel of the Suns, the Cartel de los Soles, which is a criminal organization that happens to masquerade as a government. The Maduro regime is not a government. It’s not a legitimate government. We’ve never recognized them as such. They are a criminal enterprise that basically has taken control of a national territory, of a country, and who by the way are also threatening U.S. oil companies that are operating lawfully in Guyana.

So the President has been very firm. Anything that’s a threat to the national security threat to the United States he’s going to confront. And – but obviously I have nothing further to add to that at this point. Thank you.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, if I may.

SECRETARY RUBIO: Yes. One more.

QUESTION: How are the preparations for the Putin-Trump meeting going in Alaska?

SECRETARY RUBIO: They’re going very fast because this was put together very quickly and it’s in Alaska. So we’ve got to get there. We’ll see how tomorrow plays out. As the President said, his hope is to interact with Putin tomorrow and sort of get a sense very quickly and early whether a peace is possible or not.

The President has spoken to him, I believe, four times to him by phone and felt it was important to now speak to him in person and look him eye – in the eye and figure out what was possible and what isn’t. This is the President at peace. He wants that war to end. He’s going to do everything he possibly can. If he sees an opportunity to talk about achieving peace, he’s going to pursue it. And we’ll know tomorrow at some point – as the President said, probably very early in that meeting – whether something is possible or not. We hope it is.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.)

QUESTION: (In Spanish.)

SECRETARY RUBIO: (In Spanish.) I’m sorry.

QUESTION: Secretary, do you think that the Ukrainians are prepared to cede any land (inaudible) control, or are we looking at more a return of potentially Russian forces from the current front line of the war?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, to achieve a peace, I think we all recognize that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees. They’ll have to be some conversation about territorial disputes and claims and what they’re fighting over. All of these things will be part of a comprehensive thing. But I think the President’s hope is to achieve some stoppage of fighting so that those conversations can happen. These are highly technical things that take some time to work out.

So what – to have a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia, you will need agreement from both Ukraine and Russia. And this war has been going on for three and a half years now. It was a war that started under the previous administration. The President has inherited that, and he’s trying to do now what he can to bring it to an end. But obviously the longer these wars go on, the harder they are to end.

And even as I speak, even as we talk here now, there are changes happening in the battlefield which have an impact on what one sides views as leverage or the other. So that’s the reality of ongoing fighting, which is why a ceasefire is so critical. That’s been our proposal from Jeddah when we left in Saudi Arabia.

But we’ll see what’s possible tomorrow. Let’s see how the talks go. And we’re hopeful. We’re – we want there to be a peace. We’re going to do everything we can to achieve one, but ultimately it’ll be up to Ukraine and Russia to agree to one. Okay. Thank you, guys.",https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Seal_only-1.png,N,,2025-08-14 15:57:27.552326

They quoted James Madison — the fourth U.S. president and an author of the Federalist Papers — to make their point.
The brief was just the latest in a flurry of filings since the tug-of-war over the U.S. attorney position began earlier this summer.
President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, to the job on March 24, but she wasn’t sworn in until March 28.
Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant can serve as acting U.S. attorney for 210 days.","A bipartisan group of Congress members has waded into the fight over whether Alina Habba should keep her job as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney, arguing that the Trump administration’s “machinations” to keep her in office violate a federal law meant to reinforce the separation of powers required by the Constitution.

The brief filed Wednesday by Democrat Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, four other House Democrats, and a former Republican congressman comes one day before a federal judge in Pennsylvania will hear arguments in a criminal defendant’s challenge of Habba’s authority.

Lawyers are expected to square off Friday in Williamsport before U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann over Irvington man Julien Giraud Jr.’s effort to disqualify Habba. Federal judges tried to end Habba’s turbulent tenure last month by appointing her top deputy as her successor, but the Trump administration fired that replacement and reinstalled Habba, setting the stage for Friday’s showdown in Pennsylvania.

In Wednesday’s brief, the Congress members said they aimed to inform Brann of Congress’s intent and authority in creating the statutory framework that governs the appointment of U.S. attorneys. Besides Pallone, the other politicians on the brief are Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts), Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), and Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), plus former Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, a Republican who represented Maryland for nine terms until 2009.

The six voted in favor of the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act, a 2007 law that gives the Senate 120 days to approve a U.S. attorney appointed by the president or attorney general and allows federal judges to appoint someone if the clock runs out with no Senate action.

The law was meant to codify the checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches that the Constitution’s appointments clause requires, the Congress members noted in the brief. They urged Brann “not to ratify the Administration’s attempt to sidestep the Appointments Clause with respect to Ms. Habba.”

Splitting the responsibility for appointments between the executive and legislative branches acts as a check on favoritism, prevents unfit people from being appointed, and ensures one branch doesn’t wield more power than another, they wrote. They quoted James Madison — the fourth U.S. president and an author of the Federalist Papers — to make their point.

“The founders believed that ‘the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny,’” the brief reads.

The brief was just the latest in a flurry of filings since the tug-of-war over the U.S. attorney position began earlier this summer.

Brann, an Obama nominee, two weeks ago rejected Giraud’s motion to dismiss his case, even as he agreed to hear his arguments that Habba has no authority to prosecute him because her appointment was unconstitutional. Giraud was indicted in November 2024 for various drug and firearm offenses. A second man, Cesar Pina of Franklin Lakes, who is facing federal money laundering and bribery charges, is also challenging Habba’s appointment.

The Justice Department argued in a brief this week that Habba’s appointment is valid because her post was “indisputably vacant,” referring to the Trump administration’s hasty maneuvering to oust Desiree Leigh Grace — the first assistant U.S. attorney the judges picked — and restore Habba.

That maneuvering relied on widely disputed math.

President Donald Trump named Habba, his former personal attorney, to the job on March 24, but she wasn’t sworn in until March 28. That led to disagreement over when her 120 days in office were up.

The timing matters, because the judges named Grace to the post on July 22 — 120 days after March 24. But the Trump administration insists Habba’s 120 days weren’t up until July 26, and during those extra four days, administration officials fired Grace, Habba resigned, and Attorney General Pamela Bondi named Habba first assistant U.S. attorney. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the first assistant can serve as acting U.S. attorney for 210 days. That maneuvering essentially restarted the clock for Habba’s time in the job.

Administration officials have denied critics’ complaints that such maneuvering was an unconstitutional “workaround.”

Habba has drawn widespread criticism during her stint in the job, most rooted in her prosecutions of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver, both Democrats whose arrests stemmed from their May visit to an immigrant jail in Newark. Her office has reportedly subpoenaed Gov. Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, over comments he made in February that suggested he might hide an undocumented immigrant in his home.

New Jersey’s senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, had objected to Habba taking the job permanently, accusing her of using the office to pursue “frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54346957863_f55aa9fa66_c.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:57:28.727180

During most of the first Trump administration, immigration to the U.S., both documented and undocumented, remained steady despite the visible increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity.
Now, according to the courts, the Trump administration can define who it will deport, regardless of citizenship status.
Now the great question of the current Trump administration is the future of all immigration.
The more the Trump administration continues to slouch toward authoritarianism and disregard the Constitution, the less its citizens will have faith in its principles.","In 1876, France gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States as a monument to republican liberty. Conceived by French abolitionist Édouard de Laboulaye and built by artist Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue commemorated both America’s centennial and a century of Franco-American friendship.

Equally important to bringing the statue to the U.S. was building its pedestal. When Congress failed to pass appropriations to construct it, the newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer—himself a Hungarian-born immigrant—announced an auction to help raise funds for the $100,000 needed. Emma Lazarus, a poet and supporter of Jewish refugees, penned a sonnet for the fundraiser that included these now-familiar lines: “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

Lazarus’s poem helped reconfigure the symbolism of the Statue of Liberty into a beacon for immigrants. Since it was erected in New York Harbor in 1886, the statue has been recognized as an icon of our country’s status as a haven for refugees.

But what it means to be an immigrant in the United States is changing rapidly. For a century and a half, America offered a “golden door” to refugees who sought to escape poverty, war, famine, and political unrest; a promised haven to find a peaceful life. When historian Oscar Handlin wrote the 1951 book The Uprooted, which redefined immigration history, he began it by telling readers, “Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants were American history.”

Today, it seems the term immigrant is now more a pejorative than a compliment. To be a noncitizen at any point means facing the risk of detention and deportation. To be among those tired, poor, huddled masses today means being the first target in a new deportation regime engineered by the Trump administration to strike fear.

Seven months into the second Trump administration, we have observed a new deportation regime that is designed to expel as many noncitizens as possible and erode civil liberties. While it still lags behind the average number of deportations of the Obama administration, the use of fear by Trump, along with a total disregard for the rule of law, has resulted in a new immigration policy centered on expulsion.

The question that Americans need to ask themselves is what immigration will look like after the Trump administration. If Handlin once described the immigrant as the cornerstone of “American history,” what will be immigrants’ future in a xenophobic America?

To read Handlin’s study is to engage with a work that was far from perfect; much of The Uprooting concentrated on European immigrants and promoted an assimilationist view of immigrants erasing their roots in favor of adapting to American culture. But it sparked a rethinking of the relationship between the United States and its immigrant past. Handlin also represented a generation of scholars who informed federal policy; he lobbied extensively for the passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which ended the outdated national quota system and eliminated all geographic immigration bans. In the context of the Civil Rights Movement, the act represented to policymakers a new era of immigration that welcomed all.

Since The Uprooting, scores of historians have filled the gaps in the literature of immigration from other parts of the world. Ronald Takaki’s 1989 book, Strangers From a Different Shore, reminded readers that another ocean—the Pacific—was a major conduit for immigrants from Asia. George Sánchez’s 1993 tome Becoming Mexican American offered one of the most comprehensive studies on Latin American history and inspired a generation of scholarship.

But the story of immigration came coupled with a long history of immigration control. Alongside the hundreds of ethnographies on immigrant communities, there are hundreds of studies on how the federal government decided who to welcome into the United States. Until 1882, the concept of federal immigration exclusion was absent. Mae Ngai was among the first to provide a long study of the federal government’s expansion of immigration control and the criminalization of immigrants, in her 2004 book Impossible Subjects. Beth Lew-Williams’s The Chinese Must Go captured the early history of the anti-Chinese movement in the West, which led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that established the idea of immigration control. Kelly Lytle Hernandez’s comprehensive study on the history of the Border Patrol, Migra!, offered an authoritative report for the origins of the exclusion system we live with today. Even though the methods of immigration control have changed, the causes remain largely the same—xenophobia driven by economic strife and corporate greed.

Immigration control, although over a century old, has grown dramatically in recent years. Under the current Trump administration, however, the unprecedented expansion of policing and use of fear to enforce deportations have split the country in dramatic ways.

Americans today are more concerned about immigration than in recent years. The 2024 election put xenophobia as a central topic of the campaign. A Gallup poll from July 2024 found that 55 percent of Americans wanted less immigration to the U.S.—the highest it has been since 2001, when xenophobia swept the nation in the wake of 9/11.

But how much has immigration actually changed? During most of the first Trump administration, immigration to the U.S., both documented and undocumented, remained steady despite the visible increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity. The Migration Policy Institute found that, despite the increase in ICE raids, legal migration to the United States only dipped slightly during that time. During the Covid-19 pandemic, world migration, including that to the United States, dropped drastically.

The recent rise in xenophobia can be traced to rhetoric around increasing immigration during the Biden administration. Although Biden retained several Trump-era immigration policies, such as keeping Title 42 until 2023, and issued 605 executive orders related to immigration—more than the 472 during Trump’s first term—conservatives regularly slammed the Biden administration as ineffective. Even though studies showed that undocumented immigration declined throughout 2024—long before the election—Trump’s use of misinformation during the campaign portrayed the Biden administration as ineffective in dealing with immigration.

Although experts regularly note that immigrants have a positive effect on the overall economy, immigration again emerged as the scapegoat for the inflation that occurred during the Biden administration. Indeed, the Migration Policy Institute found in their study of immigration and the 2024 election that Trump’s statements on immigration mimicked the anti-immigrant backlash of the 1920s that led to the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act.

The anti-immigrant sentiment of today, just as in the 1920s, specifically targets immigrants of color. Historically, the demonization of immigrants—notably Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican Americans—has been used as a tactic to strike fear into white voters.

Yet it is also thanks to these immigrants, such as Wong Kim Ark, the plaintiff in the 1898 Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that the definition of birthright citizenship is enshrined in our legal system to benefit all Americans.

Anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Trump and Stephen Miller is not only appearing in political discourse but is also embedded in today’s culture. To offer a comparison from history, we can see F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel The Great Gatsby, published the year after the landmark 1924 Immigration Act. You can find the xenophobia of the period represented in the character of Tom Buchanan, who regularly repeats lines from the work of Lothrop Stoddard (he misremembers his name as “Goddard”), and who quotes Stoddard’s most infamous text, the 1920 volume The Rising Tide of Color. In it, Stoddard prophesized the end of white supremacy because of the rise of nations of color and called upon the U.S. to ban immigrants and maintain racial segregation.

The text influenced the 1924 Immigration Act, which banned immigration from outside of Europe and placed harsh limits on non-Nordic European immigrants, and became a staple of white supremacist literature. Trump’s past remarks on the negative genes of immigrants echo Stoddard’s own arguments for eugenics—that European genes should define the United States. Evidence of such remarks are emboldening white supremacist groups such as Return to the Land, an Arkansas-based white Christian group whose proclaimed goal is to establish white communities in Arkansas and Missouri.

Not only have the immigration policies of the current Trump administration brought into question the historic identity of the United States as a nation of immigrants, but the wholesale raids on immigrants have jeopardized the rule of law.

As the Supreme Court showed in its ruling in United States v. CASA, the court has given the president unchecked power over federal judges to enforce his order against birthright citizenship. Now, according to the courts, the Trump administration can define who it will deport, regardless of citizenship status. As Justice Sotomayor put it so clearly in her dissent: “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates.”

Under the current Trump administration, immigration has been redefined broadly as a question of national security to justify the expansion of ICE sweeps and deportations. The shoehorning of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify mass detentions and deportations, and the Supreme Court’s lackadaisical response to its use, has also called into question the fragility of checks and balances to protect constitutional rights.

When the legal system fails to defend one minority group, such as immigrants, it threatens the freedoms of other citizens. When the U.S. government detained 120,000 Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II, the government failed to protect the rights of its citizens by caving to the demands of special interest groups: white farm owners seeking to remove Japanese American farmers as competition, newspaper moguls who profited off of the hate speech and rumormongering, and politicians wanting to score political points among their wealthy constituents. In fact, the nativist group the Sons of the Golden West, citing the incarceration, sued the County of San Francisco to eliminate Japanese Americans from San Francisco’s voter rolls in a failed attempt to overturn Wong Kim Ark and strip confined Japanese Americans of their U.S. citizenship.

When the Supreme Court agreed with the government in the cases of Hirabayashi and Korematsu v. United States, it not only failed to provide justice for Japanese Americans but also created a framework for mass detention of any particular group during a state of emergency.

And, unlike previous administrations, the current administration has deployed new tactics, such as inhumane detention facilities and deportation to third-party countries like South Sudan, to deter future immigration. Whether the rhetoric is about the economic security of the United States or the supposed criminality of immigrants, the status of immigrants in the U.S. is now more tenuous than ever. As Justice Robert Jackson presciently warned in his Korematsu dissent, once established, the precedent lies around “like a loaded weapon” for an unscrupulous future administration to use with a plausible claim of need.

Now the great question of the current Trump administration is the future of all immigration. As recent policy changes, such as Congress’s approval of the tripling of ICE’s budget, have demonstrated, the Trump administration hopes to curtail all immigration—illegal or legal.

First, ICE’s arbitrary detention of undocumented citizens and green card holders—those who went through the legal process of acquiring residency—represents a new moment in American history. Criminality, as the rhetoric indicated, was the basis for excluding immigrants. But as we have seen in the past seven months, the targets of ICE sweeps have been largely immigrants without criminal records. Examples range from ICE’s detaining of Jon Evans, an immigrant from Jamaica who purchased a firearm for his job as a reserve police officer for the town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine, to Caroline Dias Goncalves, a University of Utah nursing student detained following a traffic stop in Colorado. Recent data has shown that 70 percent of detainees are immigrants, documented or otherwise, with no criminal record.

The use of mass, indiscriminate deportations is designed to strike fear among immigrants and citizens alike. For those with ties to, or who are supportive of, immigrant communities, criticism of the Trump administration or attempts to document ICE arrests have led to assaults and unjust detentions. Courtrooms—trusted sites for justice—are now traps designed by ICE. The recent assault on Senator Alex Padilla at a Department of Homeland Security press conference by an ICE agent represented a new low for the Trump administration’s attempt to silence criticism.

Cory Booker, who co-sponsored legislation with Padilla to unmask (literally and bureaucratically) ICE agents with the VISIBLE Act, told his colleagues: “For weeks, Americans have watched federal agents with no visible identification detain people off the streets and instill fear in communities across the country. Reports of individuals impersonating ICE officers have only increased the risk to public and officer safety. The lack of visible identification and uniform standards for immigration enforcement officers has created confusion, stoked fear, and undermined public trust in law enforcement.”

Along with increased policing, the Trump administration has implemented economic barriers to keep new immigrants and refugees from entering the country. As part of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” refugees will be asked to pay $1,000 just to apply for asylum—with no guarantee of approval.

Even tourists aspiring to the visit the United States are being taxed to enter the country. On August 4, the Trump administration announced a new policy requiring some foreign visitors to pay up to $15,000 in bonds before entering the U.S. As part of a pilot program, the bond policy would require individuals from countries with high overstay rates to pay at least $5,000 upon entry—with a promise for the money to be returned if the individual does not overstay their visa.

The sure consequence of these policies will be a decline in net migration to the U.S. across the board. Such a result will have a negative impact on the economic growth of the country. The U.S. Census Bureau in 2023 developed several net projections for the available immigration workforce up to 2040. Based on 2023 projections, the immigrant working-age population in the U.S. would grow from 36 million in 2025 to 37.3 million. Future anti-immigration policies projected the workforce to decline drastically, ranging from a fall to 31 million in a limited immigration scenario to 18.5 million in the event of no immigration after 2025. For the U.S. population, which continues to age as the baby boomer generation enters retirement, the need for workers will remain as more individuals enter retirement.

But more than just economically, the United States will face an identity crisis. The more the Trump administration continues to slouch toward authoritarianism and disregard the Constitution, the less its citizens will have faith in its principles.

We need to remember that the freedoms outlined by the Constitution are only as good as the protection they offer to those most marginalized in society—particularly noncitizens. The freedoms of all Americans become ever so fragile when the powerful strip them away from the powerless in the name of national security.

It’s hard to predict what will happen after the end of this administration. But if the past seven months are an indicator of the future, the United States will progressively lose its status as a “nation of immigrants.” From there, we could lose much, much more—our economic health, our international standing, and the promise of a constitutional order that once aspired to endow us all with the inalienable rights we have enjoyed for generations.",https://images.newrepublic.com/f3851263e4e4327e9b43f2d02130071047a45d67.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:07.250850

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued the 2-1 decision lifting a lower court injunction that had required the Trump administration to restore foreign assistance payments previously approved by Congress.

Why it Matters

Trump has been a vocal critic of foreign aid, which he has called ""wasteful"" and not in line with his America First policies. On his first day back in office, on January 20, he immediately imposed a 90-day pause on all foreign aid, and he has since made sweeping cuts and attempts to dismantle most of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Today's decision will not only allow Trump to continue to wind down foreign aid grants, but it will also make it easier for the government to refuse to spend money already in the budget.

Trump Foreign Aid Appeal: What We Know

Two non-profit groups that received federal funding, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development Network, had sued the Trump administration for $10 billion in funds that Congress had allocated to the State Department and USAID for global health and HIV/AIDS programs. The grant recipients argued that Trump's funding freeze violated federal law.

A lower U.S. district court had sided with the grant recipients and ordered the administration to pay nearly $2 billion in outstanding aid to humanitarian partners.

But on Wednesday, the federal appeals court vacated that injunction.

Judge Karen Henderson, a Reagan appointee, wrote in her opinion that only the Comptroller General, which falls under the legislative branch's Government Accountability Office, has the ability to sue over alleged impoundment.

The Impoundment Control Act ""created a complex scheme of notification of the Congress, congressional action on a proposed rescission or deferral and suit by a specified legislative branch official if the executive branch violates its statutory expenditure obligations,"" Henderson wrote.

""It does not make sense that the Congress would craft a complex scheme of interbranch dialogue but sub silentio also provide a backdoor for citizen suits at any time and without notice to the Congress of the alleged violation.""

The Court of Appeals ruling means that only the legislative branch will be able to sue a presidential administration if it makes changes to congressionally approved budgets.

The court also emphasized that obligations to satisfy existing contracts were largely distinct from the question of future disbursements and that challenges rooted in existing, executed contracts remained available through other legal avenues.

The panel majority said the record about grantees' future survival without these funds was ""simply less developed.""

What is the Impoundment Control Act?

The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) limits a president's ability to withhold or cancel spending that Congress has already approved, preserving Congress's constitutional ""power of the purse."" Passed after President Nixon refused to release funds for programs he opposed, the law requires the president to notify Congress of any delays and get congressional approval within 45 days for permanent cancellations or else the money must be spent.

Enforced by the Government Accountability Office, the ICA has been central to disputes such as the 2019 Ukraine aid delay, which the GAO ruled violated the law.

What People Are Saying

Attorney General Pamela Bondi wrote on X, ""Another Justice Dept victory in court for President Trump's agenda! In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects. We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.""

Judge Florence Pan, a Biden appointee, wrote in her dissent, ""It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority. We fail to do that here.""

Lauren Bateman of Public Citizen Litigation Group, lead attorney for some of the grantees, told reporters after the decision she would""seek further review from the court. In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the administration's unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world's most vulnerable people.""

Defining our societies All in all, the picture of irregular migrants’ rights across Europe suggests that we have some way to go in guaranteeing fundamental and realisable rights that apply to all persons regardless of immigration status.","It is said that a true measure of any society is how it treats its most vulnerable members. To what extent, however, does this litmus test extend to the irregular migrants among us – namely, those who live and/or work in host communities without the legal right to reside? What does it take to be a “member” of society to whom protection is owed?

These are key questions facing all major migrant-receiving countries. Moreover, the choices our national governments make in relation to regulating the rights of irregular migrants matter for all of us. These choices affect our schools, our workplaces, our healthcare and eldercare settings, and our streets. Everyone is implicated, for this is what it means to live in society.

The first step in problem-solving around the issues related to irregular migration is to better understand the conditions of irregular migrants and the current responses of national governments. To this end, we at the European University Institute, Uppsala University and the University of Zagreb developed IRMIGRIGHT – Europe’s first database of the social and labour rights of irregular migrants. Unrestricted public access to the database will be available in the second half of 2026.

Using the data we compiled, we constructed a novel set of indicators that allow us to measure and compare the nature of irregular migrants’ rights in 16 different social and labour fields across the 27 EU member states and the UK. Our recently published results of this analysis reveal important differences in the types of rights that irregular migrants can claim by law in European countries, and they show significant variation in the quality of those rights cross-nationally.

Our research shows that European governments typically legislate to provide irregular migrants with a small set of basic rights. On the social side, these rights include access to emergency healthcare, maternity care and compulsory education for children. In labour terms, irregular migrants most commonly enjoy the right to recover a portion of unpaid wages (the UK and Bulgaria are the only countries in which they do not) and to be assured basic health and safety standards in the workplace. The range of services or benefits included in these rights is, in most cases, equal to those of citizens.

By contrast, it is only in a small minority of European countries that irregular migrants can exercise rights to emergency subsistence-level income support and temporary shelter – even in cases of extreme need. Routine income support payments and access to long-term social housing are virtually non-existent for irregular migrants under national laws.

The more established EU member states (the “EU 15”) typically offer better protections than the newer, post-enlargement member states. However, Denmark, Greece, Ireland and the UK break with this trend by providing weaker rights protections for irregular migrants.

Obstacles to meaningful rights

Amid the patchwork of protection and exclusion of irregular migrants in the rights frameworks of European countries, perhaps the bigger story is the widespread presence of obstacles to meaningful rights enjoyment. What our research shows is that it is one thing for an irregular migrant to have a right by law in a host country, but quite another to have a right that is provided in terms that enable the migrant to freely exercise that right.

Our findings show that even among the “best-performing” European countries such as Spain, France, Finland, Belgium and Sweden, irregular migrants face multiple “cost” barriers to enjoying their rights. Some of these costs are financial. Irregular migrants might have access to a variety of healthcare and education rights, but where the user costs of services associated with these rights exceed costs charged to citizens, irregular migrants might be priced out of services altogether.

User costs for irregular migrants vary cross-nationally: for instance, the UK charges 150% of National Health Service costs for certain maternity and specialised treatments, whereas the Netherlands treats irregular migrants on the same basis as citizens in regard to all healthcare for which these migrants are eligible. Costs may be waived, but the very presence of high costs can be enough to stop individuals from seeking even emergency or medically necessary care.

Prohibitive financial costs can also deter irregular migrants from exercising rights that they ought to be able to enjoy by law. There is no right without a remedy, yet our research finds that only around 50% of legal “rights” for irregular migrants are accompanied by some form of legal aid for them to exercise those rights.

Arguably, the cost that weighs most heavily on irregular migrants in exercising their legal rights is that of becoming visible to law enforcement authorities and facing potential immigration detention and deportation.

This rights obstacle can be reduced by “firewalls” – laws or policies that prevent service providers and state officials from reporting to immigration enforcement authorities those irregular migrants who, for example, use hospitals, schools and social services, or seek labour justice. It is striking, however, that only a handful of European countries offer such firewalls in regard to social rights (mostly healthcare), and that no country provides a firewall for irregular migrants to pursue their labour rights following workplace exploitation, abuse or injury.

Defining our societies

All in all, the picture of irregular migrants’ rights across Europe suggests that we have some way to go in guaranteeing fundamental and realisable rights that apply to all persons regardless of immigration status. The comparative country data we have compiled provide a new opportunity for European societies to hold up a mirror to themselves and ask if they are satisfied with the reflection. Do the rights that irregular migrants enjoy under the law speak to the values, norms and aspirations of host societies, or is it time for a health check?

Irregular migrants will inevitably remain of our societies, however well national governments succeed in limiting immigration and however we choose to set the boundaries of societal membership. By promoting and protecting irregular migrants’ core rights to necessary healthcare, emergency subsistence-level income and shelter, freedom from labour exploitation, and compulsory education for children, countries can realise their shared European ideals while simultaneously building healthier communities for all.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/685565/original/file-20250814-56-getkef.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C527%2C5477%2C2738&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:11.269176

He felt that hospitals in the Dominican Republic wouldn’t be able to provide the level of care that Soledad needed.
Under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, passed in 1986, hospitals are required to ensure that medical transfers meet certain conditions designed to safeguard patients.
“That’s the crux of the issue and what differentiates medical deportation from medical repatriation,” Torres-García said.","This article was produced in partnership with The Nation, with support from the Gertrude Blumenthal Kasbekar Fund and the Fund for Investigative Journalism. Liset Cruz was a 2023-2024 Ida B. Wells Fellow at Type Investigations.

Junior found himself facing an impossible decision. One morning soon after Christmas in 2022, his wife, Soledad, had woken up feeling dizzy and nauseous; Junior hurried her to an emergency room in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where doctors determined that the 45-year-old had suffered a cerebral aneurysm and quickly ordered her to be transported to nearby Lehigh Valley Hospital, where she underwent a series of surgeries. The operations were successful, but there were complications. Soledad was left in a medically induced coma.

Eight weeks later, administrators at Lehigh Valley presented Junior with three options, none of them good: He could pay $500 a day to rent medical equipment so Soledad could continue treatment at home; he could find another facility to admit her; or he could agree to have her flown to a hospital in their home country, the Dominican Republic.

“My wife is still in a coma, and you’re telling me she’s ready for discharge?” Junior said he asked the hospital officials. (Because of their immigration status, both Junior and Soledad have been given pseudonyms in this article in order to protect their identities.) Before migrating to the United States in 2022, Soledad had worked as a psychologist and led a Bible study group. Junior described her as positive, easygoing, and determined. “She liked to work a lot,” he said. In Allentown, Junior found a job as an industrial mechanic. Together they had raised two sons, now adults, who had traveled with them to the United States.

Junior is active and strong-willed, but he didn’t have the money or the medical skills to care for Soledad himself. And he feared what would happen if she were transferred out of the United States. “If my wife boarded a plane,” Junior said, “that’s how she’ll die.”

As Soledad hovered near death, she had entered a hidden medical netherworld, one where the failures of our healthcare system meet the cruelties of our immigration system. Even before President Donald Trump made hospitals a locus of his mass deportation agenda, lifting the federal restrictions that had discouraged government agents from arresting undocumented immigrants in “sensitive areas” like schools, churches, and medical facilities, hospitals had become risky spaces for undocumented immigrants like Soledad—places where a serious illness, a slow recovery, or the need for long-term care could put them on a path to deportation.

The problem begins, as it so often does in the United States when healthcare is concerned, with money. Federal law requires hospitals to provide lifesaving care to anyone who enters an emergency room, regardless of their immigration status or whether they have health insurance. But hospitals have long sought to limit their costs by discharging patients as soon as they’re in stable condition—particularly when a patient doesn’t have health insurance, as was the case with Soledad. In their rush to send patients on their way, hospitals have been known to pressure undocumented patients and their families to consent to transfers back to their home countries. Lawyers and immigrant rights advocates call this practice “medical deportation.”

Now, as the Trump administration steps up its immigration enforcement measures, the number of people facing medical deportation is likely to grow.

“We have noticed that under the Trump administration, hospitals are getting more comfortable with threatening medical deportation,” said Adrianna Torres-García, the deputy director of Free Migration Project, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that provides legal assistance to immigrant communities and works to stop deportations. “Hospitals are taking this opportunity—this anti-immigrant climate—to become a little more bold about not wanting to work with immigrants who don’t have health insurance.”

The scale of the problem is not easy to track. Hospitals and the companies they hire to facilitate such removals are not required to report international transfers to state or federal regulators. However, interviews with patients, immigrant rights advocates, lawyers, and other experts, along with an analysis of news articles and academic studies, suggest that medical deportation is a frighteningly common occurrence that has likely affected thousands of patients. And given the current political realities, transfers that might once have been surreptitious affairs may now happen more openly.

“We know that it’s a real problem,” said Torres-García. “We’ve had people from Wisconsin, Indiana, and DC reach out to us for help.”

Under Trump’s presidency, undocumented immigrants have become more concerned about their safety in hospital settings. A recent survey by KFF, a health policy research nonprofit, found that many undocumented immigrants said they would avoid seeking healthcare out of fear of being detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Yet even before Trump’s return to the White House, the threat was significant. For Junior, the hospital’s efforts to transfer Soledad left him terrified for her health and scrambling for a solution. “They gave me an ultimatum,” Junior said. “They said, ‘We send her to the Dominican Republic, or you take her home.’”

Even without the prospect of deportation, the treatment for Soledad’s aneurysm was traumatic. Junior recalls surgery after surgery, during which doctors shaved her head, removed a piece of her skull, and placed her on a respirator so she could breathe. “She had so many devices connected to her,” he said.

For three weeks, doctors kept her on a sedative in the hopes that it would allow her body to heal. At the end of January 2023, they gradually took her off the medication, but instead of waking up, Soledad remained unresponsive.

It was during this time, Junior said, that his meetings with hospital staff became increasingly fraught as they began to inquire about her immigration status. Then, during a meeting with Lehigh Valley administrators and staff from the medical transport company Med­Escort in early February, Junior said they raised the possibility of transferring Soledad to the Dominican Republic.

For Junior, the idea was a nonstarter. He felt that hospitals in the Dominican Republic wouldn’t be able to provide the level of care that Soledad needed. Indeed, the lack of adequate healthcare was one of the reasons they had sought a new life in the United States.

“I wasn’t going to sign any kind of document to authorize it,” Junior said of the transfer.

Medical records obtained by The Nation and Type Investigations suggest that Lehigh Valley continued to make plans for Soledad’s transfer, however, despite Junior’s repeated objections. According to these records, the hospital first documented its plan to send Soledad to the Dominican Republic on February 8, 2023, after meeting with MedEscort two days earlier. Over the next three weeks, doctors regularly evaluated whether Soledad’s condition made her stable enough for discharge, while MedEscort worked to coordinate the transfer and connect with a hospital in the Dominican Republic that could accept her.

Lehigh Valley Hospital did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Soledad’s case.

Under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, passed in 1986, hospitals are required to ensure that medical transfers meet certain conditions designed to safeguard patients. Such transfers—whether to a domestic facility or an international one—must involve minimal health risks and be carried out via an appropriate mode of transportation, such as an ambulance or a private plane outfitted with medical equipment. The receiving facility must have both the space for the necessary treatment and personnel who are qualified to provide it.

Beyond these immediate requirements, discharge plans must be consistent with a patient’s health goals and treatment preferences as well as designed to reduce factors that could lead to a preventable hospital readmission. In Pennsylvania, hospitals must also ensure that patients are informed about follow-up care and are given guidance on accessing financial assistance for their hospital bills.

Finally, the US Department of Health and Human Services’ regulations dictate that patients, or their representatives, have a right to participate in “planning for care after discharge.” And hospitals are required to provide information in a patient’s native language. The idea is that hospitals must engage in a process that allows for “informed consent.” In Soledad’s case, however, as in many cases of medical deportation, the question of consent soon gave way to pressure.

“That’s the crux of the issue and what differentiates medical deportation from medical repatriation,” Torres-García said. Patients may consent to medical repatriation for any number of reasons: An executive who falls ill while traveling abroad for business, for example, or a tourist on vacation who has an accident might prefer to receive medical care in their home country. These patients elect to be treated outside of the country where they were injured. But in cases of medical deportation, Torres-García said, “people are not given that choice.”

Toward the end of February 2023, doctors determined that Soledad was medically stable, but they were not ready to sign off on sending her to another hospital in the Dominican Republic, according to her records. Then, at the beginning of March 2023, Lehigh Valley Hospital declared that Soledad’s time was up and that MedEscort was moving forward to facilitate the transfer.

Founded in 1986 and based in Allentown, MedEscort says it has repatriated over 6,000 patients to more than 100 countries. And it expects the demand to increase. “As immigration policies and healthcare priorities evolve, American hospitals are likely to experience a higher volume of cases requiring tailored care discharge plans for uninsured and/or undocumented patients,” Med­Escort’s website states. A 2022 version of the site put it more bluntly: MedEscort’s services, it said, are designed to help hospital CEOs and CFOs who are “looking to solve the problem of unfunded Foreign Patients in American Hospitals.” Top destinations for the company have included Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

“Hospitals have scarce resources. When a patient is stable or only needs custodial care, the hospital has an obligation to consider lower-­cost settings,” said Mark Weller, an attorney and spokesperson for MedEscort. “Perhaps that could be having a patient go back to their home country.”

Weller said the company follows the American Medical Association’s guidelines on safe discharges, including requiring that a patient is stable, that a discharge plan is in place, and that the receiving facility has the resources to meet the patient’s needs. “We do not support or engage in involuntary discharges,” Weller said. He said MedEscort relies on hospitals to obtain the necessary consent from patients.

Weller declined to discuss Soledad’s case but said that MedEscort exists “to help hospitals do this the right way”—something, he acknowledged, that might not be true of other companies. “Unfortunately, some vendors remove patients from US facilities without any assurance of continued care, putting both patients and hospitals at risk,” he said.

When Lehigh Valley Hospital decided it was time for Soledad to move on, it informed Junior, despite his repeated objections, that her transfer to the Dominican Republic would happen in less than a week. The date was set for March 8.

Alexandra Santos, an attorney with Free Migration Project, attended several meetings between Junior and hospital staff. She said that, despite state and federal regulations requiring informed consent from patients, hospital administrators told Junior, “We don’t need your consent.”

There is no official data on medical deportations, but researchers and immigrant rights advocates say the practice is surprisingly common. In 2012, researchers at Seton Hall University School of Law and New York Lawyers for the Public Interest released a report documenting more than 800 cases of successful or attempted medical deportation in the United States between 2006 and 2012. It remains one of the most significant reports on the practice to date.

The report is filled with horror stories: a 19-year-old girl who died shortly after being transferred from Arizona to Mexico; a victim of a car accident in Las Vegas who died after being left on the tarmac at a Guatemala airport; a baby, born with Down syndrome and a heart condition, whose transfer from an Arizona hospital to Mexico was halted at the 11th hour.

In one case from 2008, a hospital in New Jersey, seeking to transfer a stroke victim to Guatemala, contacted the man’s sister there. When she refused to give her consent, the hospital falsely led her to believe that her brother was near death in order to convince her to agree to his transfer. The following year, a man who suffered a stroke and brain hemorrhage in North Carolina was also transferred to Guatemala, where no arrangements for his continued care had been made. He spent one night in a hospital

before he was taken to his family’s home, where he died about two weeks later.

The report is scathing in its assessment of hospital practices in the United States. “There is enough information to establish that the US is in systematic violation of its human rights obligations under a variety of treaties that the US has signed and/or ratified,” the authors wrote.

John Sullivan, a former Fulbright scholar in Mexico, said he tracked nearly three dozen cases of medical deportation during a research project on the issue in 2013 and 2014. In one case, a 28-year-old man who had been left in a vegetative state after a physical assault was sent from Chicago to Mexico City, where medical personnel left him on a makeshift bed in his sister’s apartment. Sullivan said he did not know what ultimately happened to the man, but the fact that he was not transferred to a healthcare facility shows how medical deportation can leave patients in dire straits. “Medical repatriation shifts the burden of care onto families with few resources,” Sullivan said. “Patients and their families struggle to find adequate and affordable treatment.”

Sullivan also noted that, in the cases he studied, elderly parents typically, and unexpectedly, were the ones who took on the role of caretaker for their ill adult child, who had often been the family breadwinner. These children had traveled to the United States not only to secure their own livelihoods but also, in many cases, to support their families back home.

There have been more recent stories as well. In 2020, the case of an undocumented patient at Philadelphia’s Jefferson Torresdale Hospital sparked a local outcry. The man, known as A.V., was walking from his apartment to a nearby grocery store when he was struck by a motorcycle, leaving him with multiple fractures and severe brain injuries. A few weeks later, A.V.’s niece, Claudia Martinez, received a call from a social worker at the hospital inquiring about his immigration status. When the worker learned that A.V. was undocumented, she informed Martinez that her uncle would be transferred to Guatemala later that month.

“How is that possible?” Martinez recalls asking.

She said the hospital told her it had obtained the consent of A.V.’s wife, Juanita, an assertion that both women dispute. Juanita said she never received a call in 2020 regarding her husband’s transfer.

“It’s like they took advantage of the situation,” Martinez said. “They could say they received authorization from his wife…but that was a lie.” Martinez said that a hospital official continued to pressure her into agreeing to the transfer, threatening to simply drop her uncle off at her home. “He told me, ‘If you don’t sign for us to remove him, we’re going to leave him on your doorstep. You’ll wake up one morning and just see him outside your house,’” she recalled. “I didn’t know what to do. It drove me crazy.”

A.V.’s story might have ended there, like those of so many other seriously ill undocumented immigrants. But in June 2020, medical students at Jefferson Torresdale Hospital circulated a public petition highlighting the health risks that A.V. could face if he were transferred to Guatemala. “As healthcare professionals, we are taught to ‘First, do no harm.’ This much is egregiously clear—when you deport a medically at-risk, disabled individual to a country which may not have the means to care for them, you are doing harm,” the petition said.

Free Migration Project also organized a protest to keep A.V. in the country. Dozens of people gathered outside the hospital to raise awareness of the case, linking arms and vowing to block any ambulance that attempted to take A.V. to the airport. Soon, local media arrived, putting Jefferson Torresdale in the spotlight.

Finally, in the face of this growing opposition, the hospital canceled the transfer and kept A.V. in its care until alternate plans could be made. He was eventually discharged to a nursing home.

Jefferson Torresdale Hospital did not respond to requests for comment about A.V.’s case.

At the nursing home, A.V.’s condition improved dramatically, but he still required help to perform daily functions. He remained at the nursing home for four years before ultimately consenting to an international discharge back to Guatemala last year. His care in the United States had allowed his health to improve to the point that he could manage the transfer, and in Guatemala he was able to reunite with his wife and continue his recovery.

A.V.’s story, and the advocacy around it, shattered the silence that had long surrounded medical deportations—and soon shook free other instances of families trying to keep their loved ones from being deported. Maripat Pileggi is a supervising attorney at Community Legal Services who worked on A.V.’s case. She said she’s worked on about 10 similar cases since then. “Most of them have occurred since A.V.’s case was publicized so widely in 2020, which tells me that this likely happens a lot more often than anyone knows,” Pileggi said. “People often don’t realize they have any right or power to fight against it.”

One of the people who’d heard about A.V.’s case was Junior. As his discussions with Lehigh Valley Hospital grew increasingly acrimonious, he connected with Free Migration Project and organized a local media campaign denouncing the attempted transfer. On March 2, 2023, dozens of protesters gathered outside the hospital’s main entrance. A second demonstration was held less than a week later.

In response to the outcry, the hospital backed down and allowed Soledad to remain in its care.

“I wouldn’t have thought another family was going to go through this again,” said Claudia Martinez, who began working with Free Migration Project as a volunteer after connecting with the organization through a social worker. “Especially not so close to home.”

To help make sure families are spared their own medical deportation horrors, Free Migration Project and other immigrant rights advocates came together to end the practice in Philadelphia. They drafted legislation to prevent hospitals from deporting patients without their consent, and the City Council passed it in December 2023.

The legislation, which is the first of its kind in the country, forbids hospitals to “engage in medical deportation, either directly or through a designated agent.” To that end, it designates oversight of medical repatriation practices to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and the City Committee on Public Health and Human Resources, and it requires hospitals to report patient data, enabling city officials and others to track the prevalence of international transfers. The law also gives the city the power to fine hospitals that engage in the practice, and patients have the right to sue hospitals for damages.

“I am very happy that this bill was passed, and I am hopeful that it will help many families,” Martinez said.

Still, even as activists and lawmakers in Pennsylvania have succeeded in increasing protections for undocumented immigrants, the situation in other parts of the country is becoming more precarious. Trump has threatened to penalize states like California, New York, and Ore­­gon, which offer health insurance to undocumented immigrants, by reducing the federal Medicaid match dollars that help hospitals and medical facilities offset their care costs. Without these matching funds, states will be forced to shoulder the entire cost of care for undocumented patients—a situation that could strain their budgets and lead some states to cut health coverage for undocumented patients. And in July, the Associated Press reported that ICE officials will be given access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees—to help agents track down undocumented immigrants.

“You will see more medical repatriations and more attempted medical deportations,” warned Charles Blatteis, a lawyer based in Tennessee who specializes in medical repatriation.

Some states are even proposing changes of their own to try to appease the president and head off his punishment. In May, California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed freezing enrollment for undocumented immigrants, ages 19 and older, in Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program. All undocumented residents in the state would still be covered for emergency medical care—as is required under federal law—but adults who haven’t enrolled by January 2026 would not have access to basic health coverage. Without this coverage, immigrant rights advocates suspect, medical deportations will continue to increase.

Back in Philadelphia, with the battle against Lehigh Valley Hospital behind him, Junior is optimistic about Soledad’s recovery. At the end of May 2023, Soledad was moved into a nursing home, and she emerged from her coma shortly afterward. She is undergoing physical therapy to try to improve her condition and help her regain cognitive function and bodily autonomy.

“She’s still there, slowly getting better,” Junior said. “They’ve removed the endotracheal tube, and she’s able to articulate more words.”

Still, the danger for Soledad—as well as for Junior himself—has not disappeared: The Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda has trickled down to the Lehigh Valley. An administrator at the nursing home “asked me about my immigration status and noted my situation and the new administration,” Junior said. “I told them I wouldn’t answer any of their questions—this isn’t an immigration office. They told me my wife wasn’t good for their business.”",https://www.typeinvestigations.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20048077676130-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:15.931952

At the Fort Worth Report, news decisions are made independently of our board members and financial supporters.","As federal government officials ramp up immigration enforcement and deportations across the country, Fort Worth city officials appear to have no plans to actively target, identify or detain undocumented residents.

Five City Council members — Alan Blaylock, Carlos Flores, Mia Hall, Jeanette Martinez and Chris Nettles — told the Fort Worth Report that the council has not had formal discussions on how to approach immigration enforcement locally. Mayor Mattie Parker and the other five council members did not return requests for comment.

Flores and Martinez, the council’s two Latino members, said they would not support a partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, citing concern about the impact it could have on Fort Worth’s Hispanic communities and their trust in law enforcement.

“I know that if it came down to a vote, I would vote no,” Martinez said.

Debates over local immigration enforcement come amid a recently passed state law mandating Texas’ county sheriff departments join formal agreements with ICE if approached by the agency. While the law doesn’t force cities to enter such agreements, a few Texas municipalities have opted into them — including Keller.

Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has made increasing daily arrests and deportations a priority. On the first day of his second term, Trump issued 10 executive orders and proclamations related to immigration and promised to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.

Some Fort Worth council members said the city’s police officers have enough duties without acting as immigration officers. Nettles said he wants police focused on keeping Fort Worth safe rather than officers spending resources “trying to hunt down those who may not be fully documented.”

As the only Black man on the council — and as a pastor and activist — Nettles said he feels a moral obligation to stand with Black and brown residents across the city in staunch opposition to collaboration with ICE, unless federally mandated.

“My legacy and my stance on this council will always be to empower the people, the everyday residents who are trying to make a living for them and their families,” Nettles said. “I’m going to fight with the majority of our community and what their stance is.”

Keller partners with ICE. Will Fort Worth follow?

Last week, Keller City Council members voted unanimously to formalize the city’s participation in the 287(g) program, a partnership with ICE that enables local officers to screen the immigration statuses of people they arrest and book into jail. Under the agreement, Keller police will flag undocumented inmates for ICE.

Flores said he’s concerned about the negative impact a similar partnership with ICE would have on public trust with local law enforcement in Fort Worth. If the Hispanic community sees the city as actively helping ICE, it could contribute to a fear of police.

Blaylock did not share whether he would support a 287(g) partnership in Fort Worth. Hall declined to comment on the program, saying she needed more information on it.

During a July ceremony in Fort Worth with Trump-appointed U.S. border czar Tom Homan, Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law the measure requiring all county sheriff offices that operate a jail to join 287(g). If ICE offers the agreement, sheriff departments must participate, according to the law.

The Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office has had the formal partnership with ICE since Sheriff Bill Waybourn took office in 2017. In 2020, Tarrant County commissioners voted 3-2 to renew the partnership indefinitely.

The program broadly deputizes local law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration law.

This includes expanding departments’ authority to identify and process undocumented residents with pending or active criminal charges, enforce “limited immigration authorities with ICE oversight during routine duties,” and serve and execute administrative warrants on “removable aliens” in a jail, according to ICE’s website.

All Tarrant County jail inmates are subject to having their immigration statuses screened.

Rosa Maria Berdeja, an immigration attorney in Fort Worth, said via email that undocumented persons booked into jails have the same rights as anyone else — including the rights to remain silent and to due process.

In Texas, law enforcement officers may require individuals to provide identifying information such as their name, address and date of birth during a lawful detention or arrest.

“Beyond that, they are not required to provide additional information and they may choose to remain silent,” Berdeja wrote. “However, individuals should never give false information regarding their immigration status or present fraudulent documents.”

Fort Worth and other Tarrant cities that don’t have their own jails use the county’s — meaning that although city police aren’t checking for immigration statuses themselves, those arrested and booked into Tarrant jail are subject to a screening.

The Keller agreement, championed by Mayor Armin Mizani as he campaigns for a seat in the Texas House, formalized the city’s long-standing practice of partnering with ICE, Mizani said.

As of Aug. 13, two other municipal police departments in Texas are partnering with ICE through 287(g): the Splendora Police Department just north of Houston and the Nixon Police Department east of San Antonio.

Keller’s population is about 47,000 residents, according to the city’s estimates. That’s less than 5% of Fort Worth’s current population of more than 1 million residents, according to recent census estimates.

Nettles said he would not support Fort Worth opting into the 287(g) program but worries municipal departments may be forced to take a more active role in immigration enforcement.

He believes Fort Worth has already conceded local control to the federal government by suspending the city’s diversity, equity and inclusion programs with a split council vote after the Trump administration threatened to withhold federal grants from government entities that continue DEI programming.

In April, Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to identify “sanctuary jurisdictions” — localities that have policies or regulations that impede federal immigration enforcement. While federal officials cannot force cities to formally partner with ICE, it can withhold federal dollars and contracts from cities that refuse to.

A 2017 state law effectively banned sanctuary-like policies. When the law was passed, Fort Worth was the only major Texas city to not join a lawsuit challenging it. A federal appeals court upheld that law in 2018.

Flores, newly elected at the time, wanted the city to join the lawsuit, describing the state law as “neither just nor fair.” He was one of four council members in 2017 who voted unsuccessfully to join the suit.

Leaders want fairness, compassion from new top cop

As the city looks to hire its next police chief, Nestor Martinez, president of Fort Worth’s chapter of the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization, said he’s looking for a chief who will prioritize educating Hispanic communities about what immigration policies are in place and what police officers are legally allowed or required to do.

In a July interview with the Report, he noted Tarrant County’s yearslong participation in 287(g), saying residents may need to be reeducated on the program.

“You see all those postings on Facebook that ‘ICE is over here’ and ‘Police are out here enforcing immigration issues.’ A lot of times, that’s just not the case. It’s just officers that are doing things that we’ve done for a long time,” he said, adding that officers aren’t arresting anyone randomly.

The Fort Worth Police Department’s communications team did not return a request for comment.

Council member Martinez wants the next police chief to carefully consider the city’s large Hispanic population. In the 2020 census, the demographic represented 35% of Fort Worth’s population.

In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 18.6% of Fort Worth’s residents, or about 170,918 people, were foreign-born. Of that amount, about 62%, or nearly 106,000 people, were not U.S. citizens.

Flores wants the new chief to continue the police department’s focus on “building community trust, transparency, inspiring department excellence, and safety for all residents.”

“As a Latino city leader, my vision for a police chief is someone who will prioritize fighting crime without compromising the trust and cooperation of our diverse community,” Flores said in a statement. “The best way to do that is through clear communication, empathy, fair practices and a demonstrated commitment to equitable policing.”

Some officials said they want local law enforcement to focus on educating Fort Worth’s Hispanic communities and building trust rather than enforcing immigration policies or assisting ICE.

Council member Martinez said undocumented residents shouldn’t call attention to themselves from law enforcement by risking crimes such as speeding or drinking and driving.

Martinez said her office takes calls from residents citywide to help them through any immigration concerns. She is planning a listening session with the police department in October and working on creating a nationalization clinic.

As a Hispanic leader, she said she wants to use her position of power to empower and educate residents, rather than navigating a partnership with ICE.

“I would be very concerned for our Latino community if (an ICE partnership) was a direction we were taking,” Martinez said. “We, at least in Fort Worth, I feel, support our Latino community.”

Ryan Harvey, an organizer based in Baltimore, say Avelo’s role in deportation flights gives Democratic leaders a chance to lead.
In April, however, Avelo announced that it was adding ICE flights to a roster that had previously consisted mostly of cheap flights between mid-sized cities and vacation destinations.
Matt Meyer said in April that he would not fly on Avelo flights personally.
“We expected more leadership from the Democratic Party to take on Avelo.” In Maryland, activists have not found evidence that the state aviation administration subsidizes Avelo.","Thousands of people around the country have joined a boycott of a passenger airline profiting off President Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine.

Now, activists are calling on Democratic elected officials to put pressure on Avelo Airlines, the Houston-based low-cost carrier at the center of the controversy, by ending subsidies and airport leases until it cuts off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

They are making headway in places like New Haven, Connecticut, which has forbidden its employees from using city funds on Avelo. Elsewhere, however, activists have received the silent treatment from officials like Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, whom they have asked to cancel Avelo’s contract to fly out of the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.

“There is such a deep need right now for anybody in power to stand up to Trump in a meaningful way.”

Since mid-May when it began flying for ICE Air, Avelo operated 10 percent of the agency’s deportation flights, according to aviation researcher Tom Cartwright, and 20 percent of ICE flights overall. (Avelo did not respond to a request for comment.)

It’s an effort that draws direct inspiration from the Tesla Takedown movement, which belatedly received support from Democratic elected officials after weeks of grassroots anger. Ryan Harvey, an organizer based in Baltimore, say Avelo’s role in deportation flights gives Democratic leaders a chance to lead.

“There is such a deep need right now for anybody in power to stand up to Trump in a meaningful way and do something real, do something with a little bit of guts behind it,” said Harvey. “And this is an easy one, because they can just do it.”

ICE Air

Long before Trump began his second term, Immigration and Customs Enforcement relied on contract carriers for deportation charter flights.

Until recently, those carriers did not offer regular passenger service. In April, however, Avelo announced that it was adding ICE flights to a roster that had previously consisted mostly of cheap flights between mid-sized cities and vacation destinations.

The move was born out of necessity, Avelo claimed. With its passenger business failing to turn a profit, it had to turn to ICE to stay afloat.

What happened next may have caught Avelo off-guard. While the airline acknowledged that its move would be controversial, its decision has been received by a full-fledged protest movement involving dozens of protests at airports nationwide, along with calls for consumers to boycott the airline.

“They’re a financially strapped company to begin with,” said Matthew Boulay, an organizer with the national Coalition to Stop Avelo. “They take the ICE contract out of, essentially, desperation. It’s blood money. And now they are finding, I think, unexpected resistance and protest.”

The concerns center on the conditions on ICE’s deportation flights, the rushed process for deportations under Trump, and the final destinations in places like El Salvador.

Despite the burgeoning movement, it remains unclear whether the boycott has affected Avelo’s bottom line.

Seth Miller, an aviation industry analyst and New Hampshire state representative who has been critical of Avelo’s work for ICE, said it is hard to piece out the effect of the boycott from the generally dismal economic conditions for low-cost carriers.

“Boycotts are hard to make work and win,” Miller said. “Even the best of them take time. It remains to be seen how much time Avelo has. There has been relatively public news about their financials being pretty dire, but they haven’t collapsed yet.”

Subsidies Make “Huge Difference”

Activists have now launched a second front in their pressure campaign.

They are asking politicians to eliminate the subsidies that cities and states dole out to airlines like Avelo to serve smaller markets — unless and until the airline reverses course on its ICE contract.

“It can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million, in value.”

Avelo appears to rely more than most on those subsidies, its critics say. By scouring public records, they have discovered a network of direct or indirect subsidies that have included jet fuel tax exemptions in Connecticut, New York, and Delaware; minimum revenue guarantees in places like Daytona Beach, Florida; and money spent on marketing Avelo flights in cities like Wilmington, North Carolina.

“It can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million, in value,” Miller said. “When you’re running on a shoestring, it can make a huge difference.”

In places like Delaware, the subsidies have helped return passenger service to airports that lacked it for years. Yet activists say that the moral pitfalls of partnering with Avelo have grown too glaring to ignore.

In Connecticut, advocates drew the support of officials such as Attorney General William Tong and have succeeded in blocking an extension of the airline’s jet fuel tax exemption. New Haven has also barred public employees from using city funds to fly with Avelo Airlines.

Advocates targeting Avelo have found mixed success elsewhere.

Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said in April that he would not fly on Avelo flights personally. Yet the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Wilmington Airport in Delaware, is in the middle of a $9.8 million expansion meant to attract further flights from Avelo, according to a report last month in the Philadelphia Business Journal. (Meyer and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Democrats who each appoint half of the authority’s board members, did not respond to requests for comment.)

The authority “neither supports nor opposes Avelo’s operations,” its communications director said in a statement.

“The DRBA’s role is to administer its public use facility in a lawful, equitable and non-discriminatory manner. More specifically, the DRBA is required to permit operations by any commercial carrier that meets applicable regulatory requirements,” said James Salmon.

Salmon said no tax dollars are involved in the authority’s spending, which relies on user fees like bridge tolls.

Girding for a Fight

The protesters have also faced muted responses in places like North Carolina.

“Most of the electeds have stayed quiet,” said John Herrmann, who’s been involved in the Wilmington campaign against the airline as part of the local chapter of the liberal activist group Indivisible. “We expected more leadership from the Democratic Party to take on Avelo.”

Faced with such indifference, the activists and elected officials joining forces to put pressure on Avelo say they are girding for what could be a long battle.

“We expected more leadership from the Democratic Party to take on Avelo.”

In Maryland, activists have not found evidence that the state aviation administration subsidizes Avelo. Using a public records request, however, they have unearthed a contract which they say shows that the state can terminate Avelo’s right to use BWI for any reason with a 30-day notice.

More than 2,000 people have signed a petition asking Moore, the governor who is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, to do just that. So far, they have not heard back, according to Harvey.

A Maryland Aviation Administration spokesperson referred a request for comment to Avelo, while adding that the airline flies “a handful of weekly commercial flights to two domestic destinations.”

In New York, Democratic state Sen. Patricia Fahy introduced legislation that could cut off the fuel tax exemption for Avelo, but it did not receive a vote before the state Legislature adjourned for the year. Unless the Legislature returns for a special session, it could be until January until lawmakers take up consideration of her bill and others again.

While it does not appear that Avelo has conducted deportations from Albany or the other airports in the state where it offers passenger flights, Fahy said she will fight to keep her bill on the legislative agenda.

“I go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning thinking what more can I do to call out what really is a travesty on our constitutional rights and the rule of law,” she said. “Democrats need to do more. I feel that we are slowly getting more support. Or maybe, rapidly getting more support.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2210464217-e1755125502469.jpg?fit=3200%2C1600&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:26.257737

Newsweek has contacted the family via GoFundMe and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment via email.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to remove millions of undocumented migrants as he looks to fulfill his campaign pledge of widespread mass deportations.

In addition to people living in the country without legal status, immigrants with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, have been detained.

Immigration authorities have been under increased scrutiny amid allegations of misconduct, with the agency at the center of the national debate over immigration policy. Concerns have been raised over the legality and human impact of ICE's enforcement practices.

What To Know

Lewis has undergone lung surgery and previously had access to medication that supported his daily functioning, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Lewis has been held in Houston since June 30, following a prior detention in Louisiana, according to the outlet. His attorneys told the outlet he has been denied medication in Texas and has fainted due to the pain caused by his condition.

In mid-July, he agreed to a stipulated removal order, waiving his right to appeal or seek judicial review, as his main goal is simply to be released, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Lewis has a criminal history dating back to 2002, when he was arrested for cocaine possession, pleaded guilty, and received probation, according to the Houston Chronicle. In 2020, he was arrested again on charges of possessing marijuana and cocaine, as well as carrying a firearm.

""I've been in this country since I was 11 years old. Yeah, I did something wrong,"" he said. ""Since then, I went on to start my own business. I've got five children that I take care of. I've never been on child support for any of them,"" he told the outlet.

A spokesperson for ICE said in a statement: ""He is the definition of a threat to public safety and will remain in ICE custody until his removal can be carried out.""

Lewis said that he and his wife, Roxanne Lewis, had offered to cover his travel costs themselves to help get him out of the country.

""And that's without me even knowing what I'm going into. I just want to get out of here so I can get medical attention,"" Lewis said.

What People Are Saying

Roxanne wrote in a post on GoFundMe: ""Deon is an asset to his community and has been for over 30 years in the United States. He is a business owner. Providing jobs and transportation to the public. Please help Deon to be released and free from this horrible situation which has affected, devastated, destroying all of us so much.""

Rina Gandhi, an attorney on Lewis' team, told the Houston Chronicle: ""He's not fighting or disputing removal — he's trying to leave due to his severe health concerns and everyone agrees to his removal. So why is he still here? His rap sheet shouldn't matter. If anything, it should speed things up.""

Chris Van Hollen and other lawmakers visited the Baltimore U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility Wednesday after allegations of inhumane conditions.

The group was denied entry when they showed up two weeks ago.

“What we saw here was clearly a detention center,” Van Hollen said after the tour. “If you look at the people in these rooms, they’re clearly being detained.”

The tour was of the George H. Fallon federal building in Baltimore, and is the result of a federal class-action lawsuit that questioned the conditions of the center.

“There’s nothing in Maryland law that prohibits a member of Congress from talking to a detainee. Clearly, they don’t want us talking to the people who are detained here today and in the future,” Van Hollen said.

He said that the people in the facility are supposed to be “held,” according to ICE. But he claimed that they are being detained for longer than is legally appropriate.

“They want to just call it a holding facility, as you probably know, holding facilities were designed to keep people for 12 hours,” Van Hollen said. “Here, the average is now 72 hours, and we’ve had reports of people being held here for at least eight days.”

Van Hollen toured the building with U.S. Reps. Kwesi Mfume and Sarah Elfreth, both representing parts of Maryland.

They were not allowed to take any pictures of the facility while inside.

Van Hollen said that this was a crucial step in examining the conditions that detainees are staying in when taken in by ICE officers.

ICE has publicly stated there are medical services on site at the Baltimore facility. WTOP has reached out to ICE for comments on the conditions of the Baltimore location.

“We left them with a long list of questions to provide us answers for because what we’re asking for is transparency and accountability in our system,” Van Hollen said.

""When it comes to sentencing non-citizens, Canada has essentially adopted a form of two-tier justice,"" Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said Wednesday in Ottawa.

""This offends all principles of fairness that should be foundational to our justice system.""

Deportations are automatically scheduled to allow time for appeal, but certain criminal sentences remove the right of the offender to challenge their removal.

""Removing non-citizens convicted of serious crimes is a no-brainer,"" Rempel Garner said. ""Becoming a Canadian is a privilege, not a right.""

But immigration experts say the Conservatives' characterization of Canada's justice system as being biased in favour of non-citizens is simply false. They say the law is designed to ensure the sentence fits the crime, regardless of the offender's status.

Rempel Garner said her party will introduce a private member's bill when the House of Commons returns in September, promising the change will ""restore the value of Canadian citizenship.""

The bill ""will expressly outline that any potential impact of a sentence on the immigration status of a convicted non-citizen offender, or that of their family members, should not be taken into consideration,"" the Conservative Party says in a statement.

Rempel Garner's suggestion that Canada has ""two-tier"" sentencing provisions is, she said, the direct result of a 2013 Supreme Court of Canada ruling that clarified sentencing guidelines.

One of several factors to consider

In the ruling, Canada's top court said that when sentencing a non-citizen, a judge can use an offender's immigration status as one of several factors when considering what sentence to impose.

""That's what judges do in sentencing. They take into account factors that are individual that are relevant; this is just one more of them,"" said Audrey Macklin, a law professor at the University of Toronto.

Macklin said other factors commonly considered during sentencing are whether the offender has a substance abuse issue; whether they are a single parent and what will happen to their child; or the prospects that they can be rehabilitated.

""Sentencing always takes into account factors unique or specific to that individual,"" she said. ""It's a misrepresentation to suggest that this is two-tier justice.""

Macklin said the 2013 ruling also clarified that while immigration status can be considered, it could not be used to reduce the sentence below the standard minimum.

Losing the right to appeal deportation

Under the law in Canada, a person who has been ordered to be removed from the country cannot appeal their deportation order from the Immigration Appeal Division, IAD, if:

They were convicted of a crime in Canada and given a sentence of six months or more.

They were convicted of a crime outside Canada punishable in Canada by a sentence of 10​ years or more.

They were involved in organized crime.

They violated human or international rights law, by, for example, committing war crimes.

Non-citizens who have been given a deportation order and are ineligible to appeal their removal through the IAD can apply for a judicial review with the Federal Court. The judicial review, however, does not re-examine the case, but instead looks at whether an error of law was made in issuing the IAD.

Toronto immigration lawyer Pantea Jafari says that because the deportation order is automatic when a non-citizen meets the conditions of ineligibility for an IAD appeal, there is no error in law and the judicial review will ""100 per cent"" support the person's removal from Canada.

Finding comparable sentences

Jafari says she has argued similar cases. She told CBC News that the 2013 ruling was crafted to ensure the consequences of a sentence are proportional to what the judge intends.

In a case where a judge may think someone has committed a minor offence and only deserves a slap on the wrist, Jafari said the judge may decide to give them a six-month sentence.

For a Canadian citizen, the punishment would be six months in jail. But for a non-citizen, it could result in deportation without the ability to appeal to the IAD.

Jafari said the 2013 ruling simply gives the judge in her example the authority to lower the sentence to six months less a day so they can still appeal their deportation. She said this would ensure a citizen and non-citizen receive comparable sentences.

""When [a judge] is considering a sentence, they can't be blind to the fact that this person is not a naturalized Canadian, is still an immigrant and therefore will have additional consequences as a result of the sentence,"" Jafari said.

""To have [this provision] scrapped is really problematic and something that I would vigorously defend against.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7608077.1755112197!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/conservatives-rempel-garner-20250221.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:30.810069

“It’s shameful that Democrats would attempt to undermine law enforcement officers by attacking them with absolutely no basis or knowledge of their character instead of calling on their supporters to stop assaulting law enforcement agents,” Jackson wrote in a statement.
She said the bills cover all levels of law enforcement in a way that doesn’t discriminate against federal agents, in particular.","The sight of masked federal agents exiting unmarked vehicles to carry out immigration arrests has become, for some, a disturbing norm across the country — including in New York.

Those arrests have been increasing as part of President Donald Trump’s vow to carry out the “largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America.”

New York state Democratic leaders have criticized the crackdown, but have little authority to stop the arrests. They say they do have the power, however, to ban all levels of law enforcement from wearing face masks and coverings, which they say further creates a culture of fear and intimidation.

“It’s shocked my conscience. I think it should shock everybody,” state Sen. Pat Fahy, D-Albany, said of federal agents wearing masks.

“The idea that somebody can pull up, jump out of an unmarked vehicle in all-black gear with a hidden face that only shows your eyes — I'm sorry, it’s right out of the Banana Republic-type era.”

She and Assemblymember Tony Simone, D-Manhattan, are proposing a bill that would prohibit federal, state and local law enforcement from wearing masks or face coverings while interacting with the public.

The bill, known as the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics Act, also would require law enforcement to wear name badges or badge numbers, and clothing that identifies what agency they are with. There would be exceptions for certain cases, including if it's medically required or for a tactical purpose.

“When police wear masks,"" Simone said, “democracy loses its face.”

The push to ban face coverings has set off a debate about transparency, accountability, and public as well as officer safety.

‘Transparency and accountability’

In New York, Trump’s deportation directive has translated to a more than 40% year-over-year increase in ICE arrests through late June, according to the Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers that collects immigration data. Trump officials are said to have a quota of arresting, at “minimum,” 3,000 people each day.

Democrats in Congress have called for a federal ban, which New York Attorney General Letitia James and about 20 other state attorneys general supported. But no action is expected with Republicans in the majority of both chambers. New York lawmakers say it’s now up to states to, in their words, protect residents while promoting transparency from law enforcement officials.

California was the first state to consider banning face coverings and requiring more identification from law enforcement at all levels. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Massachusetts have since proposed similar legislation.

“Prior to this complete disruption,” Fahy said, “and upending of anything we’ve ever known for decades, if not a couple hundred years, law enforcement generally embraced transparency and accountability.”

Federal agents wearing masks, Fahy said, “runs completely counter (to that).”

There have been times when local law enforcement, too, has sought to conceal officers’ identities.

In Buffalo, the city’s Police Department decided in 2020 to not require officers to display their name tags due to doxxing — or publicly sharing personal information about an individual — that coincided with Black Lives Matter demonstrations and separate incidents that the Department described as riots. After civil rights advocates criticized the policy for not being transparent, the Police Department reversed that position in 2021.

Rochester’s Police Department implemented a policy during that same time that allows uniformed police officers to not show their name tags while handling protests. If approved by the police chief, they are instead given a number that they display during protests as an accountability measure.

But uniformed officers in Rochester are not allowed to wear face masks, unless it is for a medical or tactical reason.

‘Misplaced priorities’

Some state Republicans say a mask ban would leave federal agents and their families vulnerable to doxxing, and could hinder officers in doing their jobs as effectively.

“I don't really understand what the sponsors are getting at. Do they not think that ICE agents ought to use the tools to keep them safe?” said Assembly Minority Leader Will Barclay, R-Oswego.

The Trump administration also has defended the use of masks. Todd Lyons, who heads U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, said that while he is “not a proponent of the masks,” he will still allow it to protect agents. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said assaults against ICE officers have increased significantly.

“It’s shameful that Democrats would attempt to undermine law enforcement officers by attacking them with absolutely no basis or knowledge of their character instead of calling on their supporters to stop assaulting law enforcement agents,” Jackson wrote in a statement.

Barclay said he’d be “open if there’s other ways to protect these officers.”

""I think ideally to have everybody, would be unmasked and safe, and would be able to do their jobs without consequences of doing their jobs.""

But he described state Democrats as having “misplaced priorities” by proposing a mask ban for law enforcement while many of them criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul for enhancing penalties for people who commit crimes while wearing masks earlier this year.

The bill, Barclay said, ""seems like this is sort of a reaction to something that hasn't really been an issue, other than (Democrats) don't generally like ICE agents and they don't like people getting deported,"" Barclay said.

He also maintained that agents wearing masks doesn’t necessarily reflect how they think about the work that they are conducting.

Can New York ban masks for officers?

When asked about the MELT Act, Hochul said she finds it “abhorrent” that federal agents have been wearing masks while conducting immigration arrests.

“I resent ICE intruding in our communities,” Hochul said in a separate news conference. “They’ve been overly aggressive. They're hurting our businesses and our families and people who’ve been hardworking members of our society, some for decades.”

Ella Weber has been a volunteer court watcher in New York City immigration courts since May, when she says the arrests began occurring more frequently. “Some days, you see a dozen (arrests),” Weber said. “Some days, it’s one or two. It very much depends.”

Her job is to inform immigrants of their rights, pass along information as needed and provide any other help as needed to immigrants as they are arrested. Initially, she said, agents didn’t conceal their faces. But that changed within days, she said, as onlookers started filming the arrests.

Jessica Bulman-Pozen, who is the co-director of the Center for Constitutional Governance at Columbia Law School, said the mask bill presents a fundamental question about what it means if federal agents feel compelled or are told to conceal their identities while doing their work.

Contrary to Barclay’s argument about officer safety, she said the bill “is responding to the fact that in a free nation, rather than a totalitarian regime, the people who are doing the work of the government shouldn’t have to conceal their identities.”

“There should be transparency about who government is and the work it is doing,” Bulman-Pozen added.

Bulman-Pozen said states that have proposed legislation banning face masks for law enforcement – with health-related and exceptions – have a sound legal argument for doing so. She said the bills cover all levels of law enforcement in a way that doesn’t discriminate against federal agents, in particular.

If it did, Bulman-Pozen argued, that would be in violation of a legal tradition rooted in the Constitution called intergovernmental immunity, which protects the federal government from interference from state laws.

“The fact that the state is trying to regulate – even-handedly – the state, local and federal to protect its residents, and not stopping the federal government from carrying out its responsibilities,” Bulman-Pozen said, “gives it very strong arguments.”

One concern, Bulman-Pozen and Fahy said, is that if law enforcement aren’t required to show their faces or wear badges, individuals can more easily impersonate law enforcement by similarly wearing plain clothing and face masks, and then later commit crimes.

“I think the strongest case for the law is that the states have both the constitutional power, and you could say even a constitutional obligation, to try to protect their residents,” she said.

If passed, a mask ban won’t necessarily stop ICE from continuing to carry out arrests, Fahy said. New funding allocated to ICE under Trump’s self-described “One Big Beautiful Bill” makes it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government – a move that federal officials say will help agents carry out more deportations.

In 2023, the former president Alberto Fujimori was released from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American court of human rights to delay his release.
The UN Human Rights Commission expressed alarm about the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations” and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such serious crimes”.
Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations.
“This amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.","Human rights groups and families of victims of Peru’s two-decade internal armed conflict have expressed outrage after the country’s government granted a blanket amnesty for all military and police officers accused of human rights crimes from 1980 to 2000.

The Peruvian president, Dina Boluarte, signed the amnesty – which was approved by the country’s congress last month – into law on Wednesday, to the applause of military top brass and ministers at Lima’s government palace.

The legislation prevents the criminal prosecution and conviction of former soldiers, police officers and self-defence committee fighters accused of serious human rights violations in the country’s fight against leftist insurgents of the Mao-inspired Shining Path and other groups.

Gisela Ortiz, the sister of one of the victims of a 1992 death squad massacre, said on X: “A government that violates human rights enacts an amnesty law for those who support it: police and military personnel who murdered, disappeared and raped between 1980 and 2000.”

Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, described the law as a betrayal of Peruvian victims. “It undermines decades of efforts to ensure accountability for atrocities and weakens the country’s rule of law even further,” she said.

The brutal and protracted conflict was marked by atrocities committed by both sides. Between 1980 and 2000, nearly 70,000 people were killed and 20,000 disappeared, according to the findings of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission; Shining Path fighters were responsible for about 54% of the deaths and the military for the rest.

Boluarte said: “With the enactment of this amnesty law, the Peruvian government and congress recognise the sacrifice of members of the armed forces, the police and self-defence groups in the fight against terrorism.”

She added: “We’re giving them back the dignity that should never have been questioned.”

There has been widespread concern about backsliding on human rights under Boluarte’s government. In 2023, the former president Alberto Fujimori was released from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American court of human rights to delay his release. Last year, Peru’s congress approved a bill establishing a statute of limitations for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed before 2003.

The UN Human Rights Commission expressed alarm about the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations” and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such serious crimes”.

Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations.

“This amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Peru is now a pariah state from the point of view of international law. It puts Peru on the same level as Venezuela and Nicaragua for their outright disregard for the rulings of the inter-American court and of international law more generally.”

She expressed disappointment at what she called a “cynical move”, especially as Peru “for many years did make meaningful efforts to bring perpetrators of serious human rights violations to justice”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e5f188a3f4697dbb73444a14125e68a157daddf/1242_883_3261_2608/master/3261.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b379a3556798f8dcab8a7d5e288745d",N,,2025-08-14 09:56:27.401663

Through “Press in Peril,” our ongoing series, we’re highlighting the challenges facing the press in a democracy under pressure. For student press resources visit the Student Press Law Center.

Last year, during the Spring semester of my sophomore year at Barnard College, I was leaving class when I received a text from my colleague at the Columbia Daily Spectator, our university newspaper where I work as an editor. She wanted me to come see what was unfolding on the South lawn of Columbia’s Manhattan campus. NYPD officers had lined up, preparing to arrest more than 100 students who had set up an encampment on the lawn as then-Columbia President Minouche Shafik testified before Congress.

For the first time since 1968, Columbia administration had authorized NYPD presence on campus to arrest students. Swaths of students gathered around the lawns as the police entered the side gates to arrest protestors, carrying them off to buses one by one. This would not be anything like the protests we had seen the past school year. That finals season, I spent hours huddled with friends in dorm rooms and libraries. We listened closely to on-the-ground reporters from WKCR, Columbia’s student-run radio, and constantly refreshed the Columbia Daily Spectator’s website for updates on the protests and arrests happening outside our windows.

With threats to academic freedom on the rise and a spotlight on universities across the country, student journalists are essential to providing perspective and balanced coverage of campuses. In some cases, student publications also provide essential reporting to communities beyond campus. Since campuses erupted as students protested Israel's actions in Gaza, student reporters have shared essential information about the protests and kept the campus community updated on important news. For example, Columbia’s student-run radio station, WKCR, livestreamed for nearly 24 hours straight during the two weeks The Gaza Solidarity Encampment rested on our West South Lawn.

As Columbia University gained immense attention – nationally and internationally – our newspapers’ reporting and op-eds gained newfound attention from reporters, elected officials, and other stakeholders across the country grasping for an idea of what was going on behind Columbia’s closed gates. Columbia Daily Spectator is financially distinct from Columbia University, which ensures that student journalists can report independently. In the opinion section, we worked tirelessly throughout the spring of 2024 to edit and publish op-eds from various stakeholders, including diverse groups on campus, alumni, and even the university administration. The Editorial Board deliberated for hours while writing a series of staff editorials capturing students' feelings and frustrations on campus.

A year later, it was springtime on campus again. The stakes for the student press looked different. President Donald Trump took office in January 2025, and his administration began to launch investigations into Columbia University, soon cutting approximately $400 million in federal funding. With another national spotlight on the university, Columbia began to grapple with federal investigations and negotiations, continued student protests, and international media scrutiny. Columbia’s highest leadership refused to sit down with Spectator journalists throughout Spring 2025. With each protest that happened on campus, the university cracked down harder on media attention, turning away student journalists from protest areas. This made it harder for our student press to do our jobs.

For student journalists, our fears of censorship and retaliation compounded when ICE agents took Tufts University Ph.D. student, Rümeysa Öztürk in broad daylight and detained her in Louisiana because she co-wrote an op-ed in 2024 with three other students in The Tufts Daily. The op- ed criticized the school for dismissing the student senate's role in student governance and called on the Tufts administration to implement the resolutions it had passed, including disclosing investments and divesting from Israel. Her byline led to her arrest. We saw this as an attack on our rights as student press and on the ability for those who authored pieces on our opinion page to share their voices and viewpoints.

Since October 2023, the fall of my sophomore year, Spectator’s opinion page had housed at least a dozen articles that addressed the university’s suppression of student speech on the war in Gaza. We had to have conversations about staff editorials and op-eds written during Spring 2024 when both Barnard and Columbia had passed similar student council resolutions calling for divestment. Were writers for Spectator’s opinion section next to be arrested for writing an op-ed? We feared this new administration would not stop there. Perhaps Trump would come after international students on our editorial board for their participation in writing staff editorials on the president’s policies.

Our fears were realized when the school began to launch investigations into student protestors, using their participation in writing Spectator op-eds to justify the school’s charges. When I heard this was happening, it unlocked a new sense of paranoia for me and other staffers. I wondered if the Editorial Board’s criticism of Trump’s policies would place us under investigation next.

As a U.S. citizen, I had the ability to share my views on current events with less fear than other students I had worked alongside for so long. I had honest conversations in pitch meetings and on production nights with other editors and writers about how to frame an argument or whether to pursue a specific topic in their writing, as well as many conversations with international students who were hesitant to express their views on paper.

Part of this fear stemmed not only from the administration’s crackdown but also the campus environment. At Columbia and Barnard, during the height of the student-led protests, it was not uncommon to pass trucks or scroll through websites bearing the faces of fellow students with their personal information displayed because of the opinions they shared in op-eds or on social media. This reality led to requests of anonymity or off-the-record commentary from students afraid their words could lead to harassment, doxxing, or retaliation.

After a protest in Barnard College’s Milstein Library, two WKCR journalists received a “fact-finding” request from Barnard’s Community Accountability, Response, and Emergency Services office. They requested a meeting with the students to provide information refuting that they were involved in the protests. Barnard asked these student journalists to prove they were with the press and provide other information in a closed-door meeting or face punishment via the student code of conduct. The meeting was later cancelled by the school but not before stoking fear amongst student reporters that their reporting could implicate them in the campus disciplinary investigations.

Despite some barriers to campus press freedom during the tensest moments of the Spring 2024 protests, Barnard and Columbia did initially separate student reporters from protestors, allowing reporters to enter protests and cover the events without penalty. This is in sharp contrast to some schools, such as Stanford and Dartmouth, where student journalists have been arrested for similar reporting on student protests, with some facing felony charges and academic discipline.

This past Spring, however, my school broke from their previous behavior. For the first time, three student journalists were suspended and quickly unsuspended after covering the Butler Library protest. For less than 24 hours, these students were prohibited from taking final exams and told they must vacate their student housing. Rather than studying for finals, these students spent the day in anxious attempts to prove to the school that they were student journalists despite doing all the right things: identifying themselves on the scene, wearing press badges, and reporting in a professional manner.

During this same protest, student press outside the library were restrained and shoved by school public safety officers and denied access to the main area where protests were unfolding – despite having press badges. If not for the three journalists who faced suspension, crucial reporting from the field would not have existed, including a timeline of events, video footage, and photos inside of the library. Even though these suspensions were temporary, it certainly sent a chilling message throughout Columbia and Barnard’s student press community — reporting on protests could impact their academic status.

After months of trying to meet with the Acting Columbia President Claire Shipman, she finally agreed to an interview with Spectator student journalists in the wake of Columbia’s $200 settlement with the Trump administration. This is the first time Shipman has sat down with the student press – a significant turning point in the silence from administration toward the student press for the past six months.

Student journalists at Barnard and Columbia are not alone. Universities across the country continue to crack down on student press. I know that a free press is critical to our society. Columbia’s student journalists have worked tirelessly to follow protocol instituted by the university, while also learning how to function as the University’s Fourth Estate, keeping power accountable. As I start the new school year and my senior year, I hope student reporters, editors, and press broadly can continue to hold those in power on campus accountable for their actions and inform communities in the process. I hope to spend my last year on the opinion section working on new projects, continuing to cover unfolding situations on campus, and upholding the opinion section’s motto to “reflect and direct campus discourse.”",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/08/s-j-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 13:57:41.251253

The debate will be opened by Ben Goldsborough MP.

Background

In May 2025, the government published a white paper called Restoring control over the immigration system. It proposed some changes to reduce net migration, including making it more difficult for migrants to qualify for permanent residence (also known as settlement, indefinite leave to remain or ILR). This status gives people broadly the same rights as British citizens, such as to work without restrictions and claim benefits if necessary.

At present, the standard qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain is five years. The white paper proposes changing this to ten years, but allowing some people to qualify more quickly. Under this “earned settlement” proposal, there will be a shorter pathway than ten years for people who have made “Points-Based contributions to the UK economy and society” (paragraph 266 of the white paper).

The white paper does not say how these points will be earned or how much of a reduction on the ten-year qualifying period will be available. No changes to the rules have been made yet.

Which visa categories will be affected by the longer qualifying period?

There are explicit exemptions for partners of British citizens, who will continue to qualify for settlement after five years, and for victims of domestic abuse (see paragraph 265). In addition, people with post-Brexit residence rights under the EU Settlement Scheme have the right to permanent residence after five years under Article 15 of the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement.

The government has not confirmed whether other immigration routes with a five-year pathway to permanent residence will be exempt. Asked whether people with a Hong Kong British National (Overseas) visa would be affected, the Minister for Migration and Citizenship stated “we will be consulting on the earned settlement scheme later this year and will provide details of how the scheme will work after that, including which immigration routes it will apply to”. The consultation has not begun yet.

Will people already in the UK be affected by the longer qualifying period?

The government has not confirmed whether people already in the immigration routes affected will have to wait longer for settlement, as opposed to the change only applying to those arriving after the implementation date.

The white paper’s technical annex suggests that the Home Office does envisage that the change will affect those already here: “a number of those currently in the UK are likely to leave due to it taking longer to gain settled status” (PDF, paragraph 11). Similarly, the BBC and Financial Times have reported (citing unattributed government sources) that this is the government’s intention, possibly with mitigations for people who are already close to qualifying for settlement.

MPs have been asking questions on this issue but the responses so far have said that it will also be addressed as part of the consultation process: see for example HC Deb 12 May 2025 c68; HC Deb 2 June 2025 cc15-16; PQ 58441, answered on 17 June 2025.

The petitions

Exemption for people already in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa

The Keep the 5-Year ILR pathway for existing Skilled Worker visa holders petition that the proposed increase to the qualifying period should only apply to future arrivals and that existing Skilled Worker visa holders in the UK should be exempt. Skilled Worker is the main UK work visa. It includes the Health and Care Worker subcategory for NHS staff.

The petition is open until 23 November 2025 and had received 157,000 signatures at time of writing.

In its response to the petition, given on 17 June 2025, the government stated that “as with several other measures in the Immigration White Paper, the proposals on earned settlement will be subject to a formal consultation process, and we welcome this contribution to that process”.

Exemption for Hongkongers

The Keep 5-year ILR terms to Hong Kong British National (Overseas) visas petition urges the government to keep the permanent residence qualifying period for this visa at five years. The BNO visa was launched in January 2021 in response to concerns about an erosion of human rights in Hong Kong.

The petition is open until 25 December 2025 and had received 108,000 signatures by August 2025.

In its response to the petition, given on 11 July 2025, the government stated “we are firmly committed to the existing Hong Kong community in the UK and all those who will arrive in future. Further details of measures in the Immigration White Paper will be set out in due course”.

Commentary and further reading

The Migration Observatory, an immigration research project based at Oxford University, has said that a ten year route to settlement would “make the UK more restrictive than most other high income countries” and that “the impact on migration numbers is likely to be limited”.

It added that a longer route to settlement would come with a “trade-off between the financial benefits of higher immigration fees for the government, and the negative effects on the integration and wellbeing of migrants”.

The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has urged the government to provide clarity for the estimated 1.7 million people in the UK awaiting permanent residence who are now “in limbo” as they “do not know what the new rules will be, how they will be affected, or how long they will have to wait to get settlement and citizenship”.

The IPPR has also argued that “lengthening the route to settlement risks holding up migrant integration and significantly expanding the group of people in the UK with insecure status.

In a letter to the Home Secretary, the charity Hong Kong Watch, stated that changing the eligibility criteria for ILR would be a “grave reneging on promises made by the UK government to the British Nationals of Hong Kong” and that the government should “ensure that the original commitment made to BNO Hong Kongers in 2020 is upheld.

Benedict Rogers, the co-founder of Hong Kong Watch, has warned of the challenges BNO Hong Kongers would face if the eligibility criteria for ILR is changed:

Now is not the time for the UK to back away from its promises to Hong Kongers. Extending the waiting time for ILR to ten years would pull the rug from under those who have sacrificed so much to build a new life here. It would leave them unprotected by British consulates when travelling abroad, unable to withdraw their retirement savings from Hong Kong, and ineligible for home fee status at UK universities, pricing many out of higher education.

The Social Market Foundation has argued that the government is partly motivated by the fiscal cost of “the access to welfare entitlements which ILR provides”. It points to reported observations by Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, that “migrants who have spent 5-10 years in the UK generally receive access to a broad range of welfare entitlements” and “those who arrived in the UK during the period of very high immigration in the past few years will become eligible for indefinite leave to remain over the course of this Parliament”.

(WTVF) — Officials in Mason have approved two separate agreements to convert a former prison into an immigration detention facility, despite opposition from many residents during a town meeting.

The Mason Board of Aldermen voted to approve a contract with private prison company CoreCivic. In a separate vote, the town says despite initial confusion, it approved an agreement with ICE by a margin of 3-2, with two members abstaining.

""We had the facility for over 30 years, everybody is doing good, I'm not understand why people are against it... it's not human rights, we don't have nothing to do with it,"" said Mayor Eddie Noeman of Mason.

The 600-bed facility closed in 2021 after the Biden administration ended partnerships with private detention facilities. The Trump administration reversed that policy in January, increasing the focus on deportations.

CoreCivic says more than 2,000 people have applied for 240 job openings at the facility. Detention officers will start at $26.50 per hour, according to the company.

The West Tennessee Detention Facility is expected to generate approximately $325,000 in annual property taxes and provide an annual impact fee of over $200,000 to the city, according to CoreCivic.

However, many community members expressed concerns during the meeting about becoming complicit in what they view as mistreatment of immigrants.

""There's a way for you to stimulate the economy without sacrificing the boat. There's got to be better jobs than that. Are you telling me those are the jobs that you want for your kids?"" one Mason resident asked during the meeting.

Critics also pointed to CoreCivic's troubled history in Tennessee, where the company faces dozens of lawsuits for violations at its facilities.

""Yet again, we see the expansion of the dangerous network of private prisons, a system that continuously puts profits over people and disproportionately targets communities of color for mass incarceration,"" said TIRRC's Government Relations Manager Luis Mata.

In a statement, CoreCivic emphasized that it ""does not enforce immigration laws, arrest anyone who may be in violation of immigration laws, or have any say whatsoever in an individual's deportation or release.""

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee said his administration has not been involved because no state funding is required.

""I will say that Americans have been very clear about the fact that there is a desire to remove dangerous criminals from our streets and communities all across America, including criminals that have come here illegally, and that is the intent of what the President is doing in this country,"" Lee said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit.
If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge's order.
The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee.","BALTIMORE — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland's entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn't issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration's extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland's 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration's aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump's authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

""The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,"" said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush's solicitor general. ""There really is no precursor for this suit""

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government's lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

""I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,"" Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration's case.

Hedges denied that the case would ""open the floodgates"" to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

""The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,"" she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government's request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge's order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government ""fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,"" according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that ""resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive."" Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that ""a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.""

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump's immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee. His attorneys characterized the charge as an attempt to justify his erroneous deportation. Xinis recently prohibited the administration from taking Abrego Garcia into immediate immigration custody if he's released from jail pending trial.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/DOJ_Maryland_AP_25225603751271_NAT_0814,N,,2025-08-14 09:57:28.027537

Newsweek has reached out to ICE via email and to the GoFundMe page for comment on Wednesday.

Why It Matters

Oyeneyin's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, with the president having pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Immigrants residing in the country both illegally and legally, with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, as well as those with criminal histories, have been detained. The Trump administration has deported thousands of people to their countries of origin, as well as a smaller percentage to third countries with U.S. agreements. It has also encouraged individuals without proper documentation to self-deport.

What To Know

A GoFundMe created on Oyeneyin's behalf says he was in a car accident ""but not as the person at fault,"" last week. The online fundraiser continued, ""he was arrested and charged with hit-and-run and evading arrest.""

Oyeneyin, 48, was then held by ICE due to his immigration status, the online fundraiser says.

Newsweek has confirmed in the ICE database tracker that he is held in the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The center has a capacity of around 1,300 people and is run by the Geo Group.

The GoFundMe notes that Oyeneyin has lived in the U.S. for over 15 years and that ""his green card application has been pending for years."" His next immigration court date is reportedly in January 2027.

The fundraiser noted that Oyeneyin lost his job and was unable to pay his former immigration attorney, ""which caused delays in completing necessary steps for his case — steps he was determined to finish before his hearing.""

In 2018, Oyeneyin was charged with assaulting a family member in Houston, according to court documents reviewed by Newsweek. The charge was a misdemeanor class A. The judge placed him on probation in 2022.

Another Texas court report shows that in 2019, Oyeneyin was arrested by the Harris County Sheriff's office for driving while intoxicated.

What People Are Saying

Ikenna Ezeaju, who organized the GoFundMe for Oladipo Oyeneyin, wrote in the online fundraiser: ""Oladipo Oyeneyin is a kind, hardworking person who simply wants the chance to clear his name, continue his life here, and contribute to the country he's called home for most of his adult life.""

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement previously shared with Newsweek: ""Under Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""

Increasing child poverty, household costs and inequalities Two key pillars of the government’s child poverty strategy aim to increase household income and reduce essential household costs; however, for many immigrant families these are dictated to a significant extent by immigration policies.
What is clear is that if more children remain subject to NRPF restrictions, child poverty will persist.
But if these reforms go ahead, we will continue to see high levels of poverty among children in families subject to immigration control.","Existing limits on immigrants’ social rights through the long-standing “no recourse to public funds” (NPRF) policy, already mean that most new arrivals living in the UK on a work, study or family visa are prevented from accessing income-based benefits like Universal Credit, children’s and disability benefits regardless of need. Once granted Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) – the status of permanent residence in the UK – families are permitted access to social security benefits on the same terms as British citizens. Yet proponents are calling for further limits to benefits access, including for permanent residents and mixed-status households.

Several studies have highlighted the disproportionately high rates of poverty and destitution among children in migrant and asylum-seeking families living in the UK.

In response, the Labour government plans to introduce a system of “earned settlement” through its Immigration White Paper, doubling the length of time that most individuals and families will be required to spend in the UK before they can access settlement from five to ten years. Although not confirmed, this reform may well apply to those already living and working in the UK as well as new arrivals. One reason behind this, is likely to be the fiscal cost of benefits access for those acquiring ILR in the coming years, particularly those in low wage social care professions. However, continuing to exclude children and families from the social security safety net also comes with costs – both fiscal and social – crucially to children who are growing up in the UK and who are more likely to remain here in the long-run.

Already excluded from most benefits

Recent debates have rarely acknowledged the impact of existing NRPF restrictions on children and families, which drive poverty and destitution, especially among families already on the ten-year route to settlement. A recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that families on low income affected by NRPF restrictions are more likely to face financial hardship, food insecurity and debts than other low income households. Several studies have highlighted the disproportionately high rates of poverty and destitution among children in migrant and asylum-seeking families living in the UK.

Our analysis has highlighted that at the end of 2024, there were 3.67 million individuals who had a valid visa or leave to remain which allows them to live in the UK. But NRPF conditions on their visa prevent them from accessing social security benefits including Child Benefit, Universal Credit or the Scottish Child Payment in Scotland. Of these, half a million (578,954) were children (under 18s) based on their age at initial grant of leave.

While children are of course not expected to contribute fiscally, many immigrant adults who are of working age will be “paying into the system” in line with national tax policies. Contrary to the misleading and divisive narratives from some politicians and commentators, immigrants to the UK are also “British taxpayers” if our earned income is above the threshold determined by government policies.

Without any mitigation, the proposed reforms in the Immigration White Paper, will work in direct opposition to the child poverty strategy, by continuing to limit household income for a further five years.

Households also pay additional fees to government that are unique to those who are subject to immigration control and add to the essential costs that households have to maintain their status, such as the Immigration Health Surcharge and Home Office visa and settlement fees. Prior to the latest fee increase in 2025, our analysis found that a single parent with two children starting their settlement journey in 2017 would have had to pay £27,182 over a ten-year-period on this route in order to acquire Indefinite Leave to Remain. A family of two adults and three children would have had to pay £45,560 over a ten-year period given both Home Office application costs and the Immigration Health Surcharge (assuming no further increases after 2024).

Increasing child poverty, household costs and inequalities

Two key pillars of the government’s child poverty strategy aim to increase household income and reduce essential household costs; however, for many immigrant families these are dictated to a significant extent by immigration policies. Without any mitigation, the proposed reforms in the Immigration White Paper, will work in direct opposition to the child poverty strategy, by continuing to limit household income for a further five years. Increasing the qualifying period for settlement is also likely to increase the essential household costs for families who will have to pay twice as much to settle. IPPR has estimated that 1.7m individuals including children already living in the UK could be affected.

Planned reforms may also lead to increased inequalities. Allowing some individuals to “fast-track” their access to settlement through fiscal contribution, will likely reinforce existing inequalities particularly for women, families with children, those with a disability and those more likely to earn less. Neither Universal Credit nor Child Benefit are contributory benefits; British citizens are not required to “pay into the system” before they can access this support. Existing criteria stems from other needs such as having a low income, a limited personal safety net or having additional costs associated with having a child or being unable to work longer hours due to illness, disability or caring responsibilities. It remains unclear whether the government’s new approach to “earned settlement” will also require children to earn their right to settle or how children’s settlement rights will be further eroded by their parents’ status. What is clear is that if more children remain subject to NRPF restrictions, child poverty will persist.

Overlooked costs of prolonged poverty

While the fiscal costs of welfare spending would increase if more households gained ILR, there will also be costs – both fiscal and social – from prolonging and expanding NRPF restrictions. In 2022, our social cost benefit analysis found that lifting NRPF conditions for families with children with limited leave to remain would result in a positive net present value of £872 million over a 10-year period. The main costs of lifting conditions would be for Universal Credit and Child Benefit, while the biggest gains would come from enabling better housing stability and improvements to children’s education and development, both of which are key drivers of health and wellbeing.

Household income has important consequences for a range of children’s outcomes including educational, behavioural, social and health outcomes. Unsuitable housing can have long-term effects on health, and the financial burden of high housing costs can push families into poverty. Problem debt also has profound social, emotional and productivity impacts, as well as effects on physical and mental health. As well as the financial protection of social security, lifting NRPF conditions would enable families to access employment-related support, such as work coaches, and childcare provision, most of which is currently restricted for resident families, even when they are working. This could enable families, particularly women whose employment rates tend to be lower, to increase earned income.

Existing data does not allow us to estimate how many children are affected by NPRF restrictions but we know that in 2022/23, over a third of children (1.5 million) in relative poverty were in families with parents born outside of the UK. Further denying families access to vital protections like welfare benefits will only prolong and expand the detrimental effects of poverty experienced by children growing up in the UK. The Government has not yet published a child rights impact assessment of the Immigration White Paper nor any analysis of how many more children will be forced to live in poverty as a result of these proposed reforms. But if these reforms go ahead, we will continue to see high levels of poverty among children in families subject to immigration control.

And while redistricting has taken center stage for the moment, when lawmakers return next week they will also have a full package of bills addressing interactions with the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to consider forwarding to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The bills range from blocking ICE agents’ access to nonpublic areas of schools, hospitals, homeless shelters and domestic violence centers without a warrant; to prohibiting healthcare providers, cities and counties from sharing the immigration status information of patients and street vendors with federal authorities; to prohibiting law enforcement from wearing masks or face coverings.

While much of this legislation is simply reinforcing pre-existing law with additional protections, lawmakers have established it as necessary due to many of these raids being conducted without presentation of warrants and in subsequent violation of the constitutional right to due process.

It also attempts to reinstate the Biden administration’s “sensitive locations” memo on a state level — which was rescinded by the Trump administration on January 21 — as it had deemed raids at schools, hospitals, courthouses and other locations off-limits to immigration enforcement.

“Victims are skipping court hearings. Shelters are seeing women disappear even as they’re on their way to pick up their restraining order,” said Senator Susan Rubio, author of SB 841. “…If we stop someone from walking into any of these safe spaces, we have failed them. What we are doing is we’re siding with the criminals in that case.”

Christopher Negri, Associate Director of Policy at the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, an organization that supports SB 841, says he too has seen a decline in domestic violence victims seeking help.

“We’ve heard from some of our agencies that they have observed decreases in demands for their services among certain clients,” Negri said. “I have heard of survivors being less willing to show up to court in particular, which is concerning because that’s the place where one would file for a protective order or deal with a child custody case.”

While the fate of the aforementioned package of bills remains to be seen amidst looming federal pushback, California lawmakers stand on strong ground, according to UC Berkeley School of Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky.

While redistricting has taken center stage for the moment, when lawmakers return next week they will also have a full package of bills addressing interactions with the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to consider forwarding to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“State and local governments do not have to cooperate with the federal government,” said Chemerinsky. “The federal government can’t make them do so, but they [local authorities] can’t interfere with ICE when it’s performing its duties.”

However, Chemerinsky noted that if the bills are passed and ICE officials enter these facilities without warrants, state and local law enforcement would be able to block them from entering.

Chemerinsky also said that the state government can have a general law that applies to all law enforcement, but that it can’t place a substantial burden on the federal government. However, he noted that because these bills are just enforcing pre-existing law, they do not qualify as a substantial burden.

“The Constitution is clear that the police can’t enter a dwelling without a warrant based on public laws, subject to some exceptions like the emergency exception,” said Chemerinsky. “To the extent that the state here is just saying to federal, state, local governments: you have to follow the Constitution.”

Legal immigrant representation

In addition to this legislative package, lawmakers have been fighting to include social programs centered around immigration rights in the 2025-2026 budget, such as the Children’s Holistic Immigration Project, or CHIRP.

Started in 2022 as a pilot program to provide lawyers and social workers to unaccompanied immigrant minors facing deportation, CHIRP was originally slated to last just through summer 2024. However, its timeline was extended to this June by a one-time $4.2 billion boost from the California Department of Social Services.

As Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cuts to some immigrant social services to address the $12 billion budget deficit, the program was expected to be discontinued. And yet, CHIRP made it into the final cut of the budget at the end of June.

“Around when the budget for the legislature was released, that’s also when the LA rage exploded,” said Hortencia Rodriguez, Director of Community Partnerships and Local State Policy for Acacia Center for Justice, the non-profit manager of CHIRP. “The National Guard was deployed to Los Angeles, so there was a reawakening of the urgency of why these legal services are so important at this time.”

Although Acacia — alongside various Democratic lawmakers — has been advocating for more investment in immigration legal services since the special session in December, Rodriguez said they received much less funding than they had hoped for.

According to Rodriguez, they specifically asked for a total of $60 million to be split evenly between the two years, but only received $10 million in total. Rodriguez detailed that they asked for this amount of state funding “as a safety net” for the potential $20 million loss in federal funding for nearly 30 legal service providers for unaccompanied migrant children across California.

This ongoing federal divestment has put other programs that they manage, like the Unaccompanied Children’s Program, in jeopardy. Although services have still been allowed to resume under its preliminary injunction, the long-term future of the program remains uncertain. If funding is cut, organizations will have to withdraw from many ongoing cases with young clients at risk of being detained and deported, leaving them to fend for themselves in court.

“It’s well-documented that the current administration’s objective is to dismantle due process as a whole, but specifically also targeting migrant children,” said Rodriguez. “So we really needed to pressure the state of California to step up in this moment and protect especially those active cases.”

However, their financial shortcomings combined with the reported increase in need for immigrant legal aid has created a unique situation of vulnerability.

“It’s well-documented that the current administration’s objective is to dismantle due process as a whole, but specifically also targeting migrant children.”

“Many of the organizations that are funded under this program have massive waitlists,” said Rodriguez. “There’s just not enough capacity at this time to represent every child in need… So to have that federal funding eliminated means capacity will drop, as we’re seeing an exponential, explosive need in immigration legal services across the board.”

According to Jeannette Zapitin, immigration attorney and Director of Policy and Advocacy for the Coalition of Human Immigrant Rights Los Angeles, their organization has also noted a general uptick in the need for legal immigration services, specifically in Los Angeles County.

Rodriguez attributed this surge in need to the actions of the Trump administration, noting their dismantling of statutory protections, on-the-ground targeting, and attempts to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which establishes guidelines the federal government has to abide by when holding minors in detention.

“It’s all being combined to superpower deportations in the most hidden and illegal ways possible,” said Rodriguez. “Kids are going to be at risk of being lost in the system and potentially ending up in a country that they’ve never been in, and that’s a really dangerous situation.”

“So it is a very unfair system.” In Massachusetts, one in four health care workers are immigrants, according to the Leah Zallman Center for Immigrant Health Research.
The problem is heightened by a growing need for the health care and home care workers to support aging seniors.
Shortly after, the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify system alerted Tribute that anyone with CHNV parole status was no longer allowed to work.
“It’s like my main goal here, to become a doctor, maybe a specialty.” He also described how working with other health care professionals improved his medical knowledge and his English.","For more than a year, Robert spent his days getting seniors dressed, taking their vital signs and helping them eat at Edgewood LifeCare Community in North Andover.

But one day in May, that changed. A human resources officer said his work permit was no longer valid; he would be laid off.

“When they said, ‘you won’t be able to work,’ I’m like, my God. I cried. Because I had a good relationship with the clients and they love me so much. They love me so much because I took good care of them,” said Robert in a phone interview. GBH News agreed to use only his first name due to his fears of deportation.

Robert is one of thousands of health and nursing home workers in Massachusetts who has lost or is at risk of losing their employment due to the Trump administration terminating their legal status.

“We are starting to see an already nervous health care industry lose key staff,” said Jeff Thielman, CEO of International Institute of New England, which provides workforce training for many immigrants.

Parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans launched in 2022 as a path for immigrants from specific countries to flee persecution, environmental disasters, and economic instability. They applied for the program from their home countries with the help of a U.S. sponsor, were vetted, and allowed to live and work in the U.S. for two years at a time.

The Trump administration ended the CHNV program and moved up the dates the immigrants were told they stay in the U.S. until. After a Supreme Court decision reversed a temporary injunction barring the move, more than half a million immigrants across the country immediately lost their legal status, effectively becoming undocumented. While the injunction is off the books, the deeper legal issue could still eventually be decided in parolees’ favor as arguments play out in lower courts.

‘Something so out of our control’

International Institute of New England prepares refugees and immigrants of varying statuses for employment, including through a certified nursing assistant training program with Middlesex Community College. They’ve trained more than 140 CNAs since 2018. Nursing homes, rehab centers, hospitals and patients at home all need caregivers, and the industry is already tight on staff. Immigrants have filled key roles, and the industry has been a lifeline for them. And advocates like Thielman say they’ve brought what’s needed to the table.

“They’ve followed all the rules — they got trained in a new profession, they went into the workforce in a workforce that needs them, and they’ve now lost their jobs,” said Thielman. “So it is a very unfair system.”

In Massachusetts, one in four health care workers are immigrants, according to the Leah Zallman Center for Immigrant Health Research. The share is even higher for home health aides, which had a 46% foreign-born workforce even before the influx of immigrants to the state between 2022 to 2024. The problem is heightened by a growing need for the health care and home care workers to support aging seniors.

Of the thousands of personal care attendants represented by the 1199SEIU union, 500 have been recently terminated due to changes in their immigration status. That includes many who came to the U.S. through the CHNV parole program.

Local employers like Tribute Home Care are starting to see the impact of Trump’s immigration policies. The group recently had to lay off nine Haitian caregivers who had parole through the CHNV program.

Tribute Home Care CEO John Sneath said the agency was first alerted when a caregiver brought in a “very technical letter” saying he could no longer work, and needed to return to Haiti.

“We didn’t frankly know what to do because we knew that we had others under that program,” he said. Shortly after, the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify system alerted Tribute that anyone with CHNV parole status was no longer allowed to work. Sneath said there was no guidance on how and when to lay off staff, and the company struggled to determine if it was even allowed to pay severance.

“The folks that managed our caregivers and had to make the termination calls were literally in tears and struggling to go on with their day because this is something so out of our control,” said Regina McNally, Director of People & Culture at Tribute.

She said the company has about 100 senior clients in Massachusetts, with the average client needing about 100 hours of care weekly. That work is stretched across just 200 or so caregivers.

Demand for home-based care is higher than ever, with many people wanting services in the comfort of their residences.

But that will be harder with fewer people working in the industry, and could lead to dangerous and expensive situations, said Jake Krilovich, executive director of Home Care Alliance of Massachusetts, a trade association working with more than 200 home care providers.

“[Short staffing] puts people at risk from falls or complications from chronic disease, which would then make them have an event that they would have to go into a facility,” he said “From a policy perspective, it strains our health care system. It is more costly when people are admitted to the hospital.”

The Trump administration stands by its decision to terminate the program, despite any impact on the impact to the health and home care industries. “The Biden administration’s reckless CHNV program allowed hundreds of thousands of unvetted aliens to circumvent the traditional parole process,” said US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser. He called the program “massively abused” and urged impacted immigrants to self-deport if they haven’t secured lawful status.

‘It’s still my passion’

Robert, 24, is originally from Haiti and studied nursing in the Dominican Republic because he had no educational opportunities in Haiti. He came to the U.S. through the CHNV program.

He said he “fled gang violence” in a country that is dealing with massive economic and humanitarian upheaval, and staying in the DR was not an option.

His certified nursing assistant job at Edgewood was a position he dreamed of; when he first arrived in the U.S., he could only get a job in manufacturing. Robert heard about a certified nursing assistant program through International Institute of New England, and took the necessary course while also studying English.

“It is my passion, it’s still my passion,” he said. “I like to make a positive impact in people’s lives — that’s why I love nursing.” He was thrilled to get a job he was qualified for right after getting certified in February 2024, and worked full-time to pay rent and support his grandmother, who he lives with.

“Right now ... I can’t even take care of myself because I don’t have a job,” he said through tears. “It’s hard for me to pay my bills. It’s hard for me to pay for our place to live,” he said, adding that he’s burning through savings quickly, and isn’t sure what to do next. He says he’s hoping the Trump administration will reverse its policy change so he and colleagues who also lost their jobs could return.

McKewan, 30, is also originally from Haiti. GBH News agreed to only use his first name over fears he could be detained by federal immigration authorities. McKewan studied medicine in the Dominican Republic and worked as a physician assistant in an emergency room there before coming to the U.S. through the CHNV parole program, with an aunt giving him sponsorship.

He became a certified nursing assistant in September 2023, and split his time working at Whittier Rehabilitation Hospital in Bradford, Mass. and at Amazon.

“It’s like entry-level,” he said. “It’s like my main goal here, to become a doctor, maybe a specialty.” He also described how working with other health care professionals improved his medical knowledge and his English.

But McKewan lost the nursing assistant job in June due to his work permit being revoked, and the separate job at Amazon soon after. McKewan said he’s upset about the lost opportunity. He’s hoping that eventually, courts will decide to reverse the Trump administration’s decision.

McKewan said he fears deportation constantly, particularly because of gang violence and lack of opportunity in his field in Haiti. But he wants to be as productive as possible, even with the constant anxiety of being detained. He’s taking coursework in biology and physiology at Middlesex Community College.",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/5709ab5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+136/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb9%2Fc5%2Fb0dec3c845ef857b370294ebd931%2Flowell-13-cna-cohort-6.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:58:36.896127

The Trump administration in January overturned the longstanding federal policy specifically limiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” such as hospitals, churches, and schools.
The “presumption that hospitals and clinics will be free from ICE raids is no longer the case,” Arent Fox Schiff LLP partner Annie Chang Lee said.
Fourth Amendment Limits Health-care facilities’ first responsibility is to their patients.
ICE enforcement in a medical facility could interfere with that.","Medical facilities are increasingly concerned they’ll be the next targets of the Trump administration’s immigration raids, placing health-care workers whose first duty is to patient care in a precarious position.

President Donald Trump has redefined what’s traditionally been considered off-limits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. What were previously considered safe spaces, such as churches and courthouses, have been identified as targets, leading to a handful of lawsuits over the policy shift that so far have yielded mixed results.

Recent events at facilities in Southern California—especially one that led to federal criminal charges against two Ontario, Calif., surgery center employees—are fueling new fears that health-care facilities could be next.

“It doesn’t matter who you are or where you work, if you assault our agents or otherwise interfere with our operations, you will be arrested and charged with a federal crime,” acting US Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement after the Ontario arrests.

The commitment hospitals have to their patients—including one to respect their privacy—may be “diametrically opposed” to those of ICE officers, and could lead to genuine conflicts, said Joan Feldman, the chair of Shipman & Goodwin LLP’s health law practice group.

The recent California arrests demonstrate that even non-immigrants could be at risk of prosecution if ICE raids a health-care facility, said Lynn Pearson, a senior attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.

Several attorneys suggested that health care organizations should prepare for a potential ICE raid by training employees about their patients’ rights and setting a protocol for reacting to the arrival of immigration enforcement officials.

Safe Space Shift

Law enforcement in hospitals isn’t new, said Feldman. Hospitals often call in police officers to deal with unruly patients, especially in their emergency departments.

The Trump administration in January overturned the longstanding federal policy specifically limiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” such as hospitals, churches, and schools.

The “presumption that hospitals and clinics will be free from ICE raids is no longer the case,” Arent Fox Schiff LLP partner Annie Chang Lee said.

Facilities in states like California with large immigrant populations are currently experiencing higher enforcement levels. Lee and her colleagues identified three other recent interactions between immigration agents and California health-care centers that have occurred in parking lots, lobbies, and non-patient areas.

ICE activity also is “highly likely” to increase in states with policies requiring collaboration with the federal government, she said.

ICE and the Justice Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Legal Challenges

The end of the safe spaces policy resulted in several lawsuits from religious groups, the latest of which accused the administration of violating their rights under the First Amendment and Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The coalition also said the Homeland Security Department, ICE’s parent agency, violated the Administrative Procedure Act by arbitrarily and capriciously rescinding the earlier policy.

“Faith communities, hospital workers, and educators should not have to choose between their commitments of service and the safety of those they serve,” said Skye Perryman, CEO & President of Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs.

Similar suits have had mixed results. A federal judge in Washington denied a request to stop ICE from gathering at or near places of worship and raising people’s fears of attending religious services. The plaintiff group lacked standing because it didn’t show an enforcement action was imminent, the court found.

But a federal district court in Maryland put the enforcement policy on hold in February, finding that the plaintiffs had sufficient evidence that the policy caused their congregants to skip services and that they’re likely to succeed on their claims. DHS has appealed the injunction.

Health-care attorneys were unaware of any similar suits filed by hospitals or other medical facilities against DHS.

Fourth Amendment Limits

Health-care facilities’ first responsibility is to their patients. They’re committed to helping people regardless of their immigration status and federal law prohibits them from turning away patients with emergency medical conditions, Feldman said. ICE enforcement in a medical facility could interfere with that.

Despite the end of the safe spaces policy, the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment still applies and prohibits government agents from searching private areas without a judicial warrant. Medical facilities have a Fourth Amendment right to refuse warrantless searches of private areas such as patient and treatment rooms, which should be clearly marked, attorneys said.

Additionally, staff can refuse to provide information about patients to law enforcement officers absent a judicial warrant or court order, according to NILC.

Any doubt about a warrant’s validity should be resolved by a facility’s attorney, who should be one of the first people workers call, Feldman said. Facilities should have clear policies and train workers on how to interact with officers in anticipation of an interaction, she said.

In the Ontario case, the Justice Department claims that the target of the immigration action was a man who sought refuge inside a surgery center, not a genuine patient. The health-care workers, one of whom allegedly interfered with the arrest in the facility’s parking lot, face a statutory maximum sentence of eight years in federal prison on an assault count and up to six years in federal prison on a conspiracy count, according to the DOJ.

Pearson said that different standards apply to searches or seizures in public areas such as lobbies and parking lots, where officers can enter spaces and seize items that are in “plain sight.”

The staff’s first obligation is to care for patents, not to respond to ICE, though a facility could designate responders in advance, Feldman said, noting she would never advise staff to confront officers.

Being confronted by a masked officer in tactical gear and carrying a gun is scary, and while hospital workers have been put in bad situations, these “everyday people are doing the best they can,” Pearson said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/77daa77/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6969x2686+6+363/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2F9b%2Fc7c270e940c7a501beb816753a56%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2226092155,N,,2025-08-14 13:58:00.784798

What are H-1B visas?
Congress caps new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees.
The debate around H-1B visas does not neatly fall along partisan lines.
“I have many H-1B visas on my properties,” Trump told the New York Post in late December.","President Donald Trump’s administration wants to overhaul the nation’s visa programme for highly skilled foreign workers.

If the administration does what one official described, it would change H-1B visa rules to favour employers that pay higher wages. That could effectively transform the visa into what one expert called “a luxury work permit” and disadvantage early-career workers with smaller salaries, including teachers. It could also upend the current visa programme’s lottery system used to distribute visas to eligible foreign workers.

“This shift may prevent many employers, including small and midsize businesses, from hiring the talent they need in shortage occupations, ultimately reducing America’s global competitiveness,” said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association whose practice includes representing employers in the H-1B process.

It’s hard to find US workers in certain types of specialty fields, including software engineers and developers and some STEM positions.

A White House office proposed the change on August 8, Bloomberg Law reported. Once the proposal appears in the Federal Register – the daily public report containing notices of proposed federal rule changes – the plan will become subject to a formal public comment period. It could be finalised within months, although it is likely to face legal challenges.

Joseph Edlow, the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, told The New York Times in July that H-1B visas should favour companies that plan to pay foreign workers higher wages. The proposal Bloomberg Law described was in line with that goal.

PolitiFact did not see a copy of the proposal, and the White House did not respond to our questions. But the Department of Homeland Security submitted the proposed rule to a Trump administration office in July, the Greenberg Traurig law firm wrote.

Trump sought to reform the H-1B program during his first term but made limited progress. In January 2021, near the end of Trump’s term, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule similar to the current proposal, but the Biden administration did not implement it.

Work visas were not a central part of Trump’s 2024 immigration platform, but it was a point of debate in the weeks before he took office, with billionaire businessman Elon Musk – a megadonor to Trump who would briefly serve in his administration – speaking in favour of them.

What are H-1B visas?

The H-1B visa programme lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields, with about two-thirds working in computer-related jobs, according to the Congressional Research Service. Most H-1B visa holders come from India, followed by China.

Currently, prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker actual wages paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation – whichever would result in the highest pay.

To qualify for the non-immigrant visa, the employee must hold a specialised degree, license or training required by the occupation. The status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but it can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for permanent residency, which includes permission to work and live in the US.

Leopold said that the proposed change goes beyond the law’s current wage mandate.

“This statutory mechanism is designed to prevent employers from paying H-1B workers less than their American counterparts, thereby protecting US workers from displacement,” Leopold said.

Congress caps new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned advanced degrees. The government approved 400,000 H-1B applications, including renewals, in 2024, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.

Amazon has led the nation’s employers since 2020 in its number of H-1B workers, Pew found.

The New York metro area received more H-1B application approvals than any other metro area; College Station, Texas had the highest concentration of approvals.

What could change with H1-B visas?

The proposed policy favours higher-paid employees, experts said.

Malcolm Goeschl, a San Francisco-based lawyer, said the rule will likely benefit tech companies, including many specialising in artificial intelligence. Such companies pay high salaries, including for entry-level positions. He said it will harm traditional tech companies’ programmes for new graduates.

“There will likely be plenty of lottery numbers available at the top of the prevailing wage scale, but very few or none at the bottom,” Goeschl said. “You may see young graduates shy away from the US labour market early on because of this. Or you could see companies just pay entry-level workers from other countries much higher salaries to get a chance in the lottery, leading to the perverse situation where the foreign workers are making a lot more money than similarly situated US workers.”

The prevailing wage requirements are designed to protect US jobs from being undercut by lower paid foreign workers.

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the change would likely make it nearly impossible for recent immigrant college graduates, who tend to earn lower wages, to launch their careers in the United States on an H-1B visa.

“The short-term benefit would be the people who get selected are more productive, but the long-term cost might be to permanently redirect future skilled immigration to other countries,” Bier said. “It would also effectively prohibit the H-1B for many industries that rely on it. K-12 schools in rural areas seeking bilingual teachers, for instance, will have no chance under this system.”

Amid a nationwide teacher shortage, some school districts have hired H-1B visa holders, including smaller districts such as Jackson, Mississippi, and larger districts, including Dallas, Texas. Language immersion schools also often employ teachers from other countries using this visa programme.

Why is there a debate about H-1B visas?

The debate around H-1B visas does not neatly fall along partisan lines.

Proponents say the existing visa programme allows American employers to fill gaps, compete with other countries and recruit the “best minds”. Critics point to instances of fraud or abuse and say they favour policies that incentivise hiring Americans.

In December, high-profile Republicans debated the visa programme on social media.

MAGA influencer Laura Loomer denounced the programme and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon called it a “scam”. On the other side, billionaire Elon Musk, a former H-1B visa holder whose companies employ such visa holders, called for the programme’s reform but defended it as an important talent recruitment mechanism.

Trump sided with Musk.

“I have many H-1B visas on my properties,” Trump told the New York Post in late December. “I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great programme.”

Senator Bernie Sanders disputed Musk, saying corporations abuse the programme as a way to get richer and should recruit American workers first.

Such visa debates have continued.

When US Representative Greg Murphy, a urologist, argued on X August 8 that the visas “are critical for helping alleviate the severe physician shortage”, thousands replied. Christina Pushaw, a Republican who works for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, pushed back: “Why not figure out the causes of the domestic physician shortage and try to pass legislation to address those?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25141584679644-1748476190_2db274-1748476283.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80,N,,2025-08-14 07:58:06.665759

The strikes, during prisoners’ visiting hours, significantly damaged multiple buildings, including in prison areas known to hold many activists and dissidents.

Violations of the laws of war by Israeli and Iranian forces during the 12 days of conflict between June 13 to 25 should be fully investigated and those responsible for war crimes held to account.

(Beirut) – Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s Evin prison complex in Tehran on June 23, 2025, were unlawfully indiscriminate and an apparent war crime, Human Rights Watch said today. The strikes hit several buildings across the complex and killed at least 80 people, according to official Iranian statements, including prisoners, their family members, and prison staff, in the absence of any evident military target.

Over 1,500 prisoners are believed to have been held at Evin prison at the time of the attack, including many activists and dissidents held by the Iranian government in violation of their rights. The strikes, during visiting hours, significantly damaged the visitation hall, central kitchen, medical clinic, and sections where prisoners were held, including political prisoners.

“Israel’s strikes on Evin prison on June 23 killed and injured scores of civilians without any evident military target in violation of the laws of war and is an apparent war crime,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “The Israeli attack placed at grave risk the already precarious lives of Evin’s prisoners, many of them wrongfully detained dissidents and activists.”

Between June 24 and July 29, Human Rights Watch interviewed 22 people about the attack, including relatives of victims and prisoners, former Evin prisoners, and others with extensive knowledge of the prison. Human Rights Watch wrote to Iranian and Israeli authorities on July 2 and 7, respectively, seeking information but has not received responses.

Human Rights Watch also analyzed and verified videos and photographs of the Israeli strikes published by media outlets and on social media, as well as material shared directly with researchers, and satellite imagery from before and after the strikes. Human Rights Watch was unable to visit the site, as Iran does not permit access to independent human rights organizations.

The investigation into the June 23 attack on Evin prison is part of a broader Human Rights Watch inquiry into the June 13-25 hostilities between Israel and Iran, including Iranian ballistic missile attacks on populated areas in Israel.

Israeli forces carried out strikes on Evin prison, a 43-hectare compound in Tehran’s District 1, between 11:17 a.m. and 12:18 p.m. on June 23. No advance warning is known to have been given. Satellite imagery, videos, and witness accounts show strikes damaging buildings hundreds of meters apart.

The strikes destroyed the prison’s main southern entrance and another in the north. The visitors’ information building, adjacent to the main entrance, was completely destroyed. Family members of prisoners and former prisoners said that many families frequent the visitors’ building, including to deliver clothing and medicine. The strikes also hit the visitation hall, a judicial complex housing assistant prosecutors, and significantly damaged or destroyed several buildings in the prison’s central premises, where the medical clinic and several prison wards are located.

Two political prisoners in the prison’s central Ward 4, Abolfazl Ghadiani and Mehdi Mahmoudian, described in a publicly available account the “sounds of repeated explosions” at midday near their ward. They saw the medical clinic burning, and the food and hygiene warehouse destroyed. By 2:00 p.m., they said, prisoners had extricated 15 to 20 bodies from the rubble, including those of other prisoners, medical clinic personnel, warehouse workers, and guards and officials from Section 209, a detention facility run by the Intelligence Ministry where dissidents are routinely detained.

Dr. Saeedeh Makarem, who volunteered at the medical clinic, posted on Instagram that after the strikes, prisoners rescued her from the rubble. She subsequently underwent major surgery, including hand replantation. State media reported that a physician was also killed in the clinic.

The strikes damaged buildings and vehicles outside the northern parts of the prison complex, killing and injuring residents, including Mehrangiz Imenpour, a 61-year-old artist. Domestic media reported that Ali Asghar Pazouki, a 69-year-old businessman, was killed outside the compound.

Human Rights Watch found damage either to, or in the vicinity of, prison sections used to hold people accused of national security offenses, including activists and dissidents. These included Wards 4 and 8, Sections 209, 240, 241, 2A, and the women’s ward. The main quarantine section, where transgender prisoners were held, was also damaged. Iranian authorities have not reported on the condition or whereabouts of many prisoners from these sections, which amounts to enforced disappearances in violation of international human rights law.

Under international humanitarian law, also known as the laws of war, prisons are presumptively civilian objects. Human Rights Watch’s investigation found no evidence of any military targets at the Evin prison complex at the time of the Israeli strikes. None of the sources interviewed, including recently released prisoners, family members, and lawyers who have repeatedly been to the prison said that they were aware of any Iranian military personnel, arms, or material within the compound.

Statements by Israeli ministers immediately after the attack made no claims of military targets within the prison compound but framed the strikes as part of Israel’s attacks on Iran’s repressive institutions. Israel Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote immediately after the attack that Israel struck Evin prison due to its function as an “agency of government repression.” Foreign Affairs Minister Gideon Sa’ar’s post on X indicated that Evin prison had been struck in retaliation for Iran’s attacks on civilians in Israel.

Several hours after the strikes, Israel’s military confirmed the attack, and a military spokesperson alleged, without evidence or details, that Iran carried out “intelligence operations against the state of Israel, including counter-espionage” in the prison. An Israeli military spokesperson repeated the same allegations that day in a media interview. The Israel Defense Forces’ statement reiterated previous government statements that Evin prison was a “symbol of oppression for the Iranian people.”

The laws of war applicable to the international armed conflict between Israel and Iran prohibit attacks that target civilians and civilian objects, that do not discriminate between civilians and combatants, or that are expected to cause harm to civilians or civilian objects disproportionate to any anticipated military advantage. Indiscriminate attacks include those not directed at a specific military target. Even if some individuals at Evin prison were Iranian military personnel, the large-scale attack would have been unlawfully disproportionate.

Serious laws of war violations committed by individuals with criminal intent – that is, deliberately or recklessly – are war crimes. Governments are obligated to investigate alleged war crimes by their forces, or on their territory, and appropriately prosecute those responsible. Both Israel and Iran have track records of impunity and unwillingness to investigate in line with international law, let alone prosecute possible war crimes by their forces. All governments have an obligation to cooperate with each other, to the extent possible, to facilitate the investigation and appropriate prosecution of alleged war crimes.

“The unlawful Israeli attack on Evin prison highlights the consequences of longstanding impunity for serious laws of war violations,” Page said. “To make matters worse, Israeli forces put at grave risk prisoners who were already victims of Iranian authorities’ brutal repression.”

The June 13-25 Conflict Between Israel and Iran

On June 13, Israel carried out a series of attacks on Iran that continued until a ceasefire went into effect on June 25. Israeli military attacks included strikes on populated areas; on oil, gas, and nuclear facilities; and on Evin prison. In response, the Iranian military launched a series of ballistic missile and drone attacks against Israel, hitting populated areas as well as a power station, an oil refinery, and a hospital.

On June 22, the United States became a party to the conflict by carrying out airstrikes on Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities. Iran responded on June 23 by launching missiles at a US airbase in Qatar.

Iranian authorities have not published detailed data regarding people killed and injured during the conflict, including a breakdown of civilian and military casualties. On July 16, an Iranian government spokesperson stated that 1,062 people, including 140 children and women, were killed as a result of Israeli strikes, and 5,800 were injured. Iran’s health minister stated on July 9 that about 700 of those killed were civilians. Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA), a US-based group, reported that 1,190 people were killed, including at least 436 civilians.

Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry reported 30 civilians, including 4 children, were killed in Israel during the hostilities and 3,343 people were treated in hospitals for injuries from Iranian strikes.

Casualties in Evin Prison Attack

On July 9, a spokesperson for Iran’s Judiciary announced that 80 people had been killed as a result of the strikes on Evin Prison. According to official statements, casualties included judicial and prosecution officials, prison staff, prisoners and their family members, other visitors to the prison, and people living in neighboring residential areas. Informed sources told Human Rights Watch they believe the casualty figures are most likely higher.

The authorities have not released the names of all 80 people reported to have died. Iran’s Prisons Organization and state media have published the names and images of 41 prison staff who died, including 5 female social workers, a social worker’s 5-year-old son, and 13 young men performing mandatory national service.

Those performing mandatory national service in prisons fall under the auspices of the Prisons’ Organization and the national police force, and typically guard the premises, transfer prisoners, and carry out administrative duties and other basic tasks. They are neither combatants under the laws of war nor civilians directly participating in hostilities and so cannot be targeted.

Officials have confirmed the deaths of five prisoners but have not released their names. This is particularly alarming and creates hardship for prisoners’ families, especially because the various Iranian intelligence agencies using Evin Prison have longstanding records of enforced disappearance of dissidents and activists.

Reza Khandan, a wrongfully detained human rights defender, stated in his account of the attack that among prisoners killed were those who worked in the prison compound or its administrative sections.

In addition to the list of prison staff published by state media and institutions, Human Rights Watch, drawing from publicly available information, as well as accounts from informed sources, identified several civilians killed during the attack. They are Hasti (Hajar) Mohammadi, who went to the prison to work for the release of debt prisoners; Leila Jafarzadeh, who was at the prison to post bail for her jailed husband; Ali Asghar Pazouki, a businessman who was near the northern judicial complex; and Mehrangiz Imenpour, an artist and neighborhood resident.

The authorities have not released any figures on the number of people injured in the attack. The relative of someone killed told Human Rights Watch that during their search for their loved one, they were given a list of names of 20 to 25 people injured from one hospital alone.

Accounts and Analysis of the Evin Prison Attack

Human Rights Watch confirmed, based on satellite imagery, thermal anomaly data, accounts of informed sources, and first online reports and videos, that the Israeli strikes on Evin prison took place on June 23 between 11:17 a.m. and 12:18 p.m. At 1:21 p.m. Tehran time, Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed on his X account that the Israeli military had struck targets in Tehran, including Evin prison.

Based on satellite imagery from June 25, Human Rights Watch identified eight apparent impact sites within the prison compound. However, given that satellite images collected on June 23 and 25 – before and after the strikes – were low resolution and debris clearance operations were underway as early as June 25, Human Rights Watch could not confirm with certainty that all eight sites were the result of a direct impact with a detonation at the point of impact.

Due to the resolution of satellite imagery, the exact number and precise locations of the impact sites are approximate. Similarly, in cases in which videos and photographs emerged after clearing operations had already begun, Human Rights Watch was not able to determine whether all visible damage was solely attributable to the Israeli attack.

Human Rights Watch was not able to obtain any images or videos depicting Israeli munitions used during the attacks. No identifiable weapon fragments or remnants of guidance systems are visible in the available media coverage or information released by Iranian authorities. Based on videos and satellite images reviewed, repair of damage to the prison began shortly after the attack and included filling in blast craters.

A visual comparison of each impact site shows that the scale of damage at locations varied, indicating that more than one type and size of munition was used in the attack. For example, based on the images reviewed, at least one munition appears to have penetrated the Administrative Building’s roof, with its detonation occurring only after it entered deeper in the structure, indicating the use of a delayed-action fuze.

On June 24, a spokesperson for Iran’s police force, FARAJA, announced that its bomb squad had successfully neutralized and disposed of two undetonated “missiles” from prison premises. But they did not provide further details on the type of munitions removed or provide any photos.

Strikes on Evin Prison’s Southern Premises

Visitors’ Information Building

Israeli strikes on the southern part of the prison compound almost totally destroyed the main entrance and its adjacent building. Human Rights Watch verified two videos of the immediate aftermath of the strike on the prison’s main entrance, published on June 23.

One video, posted online at 3:01 p.m. and composed of clips edited together, shows the near-total destruction of the eastern side of the entrance and a building east of the gate, identified by several informed sources as the “visitors’ information” building. Several sources and domestic media reports said that a facility for people performing mandatory national service was in the main entrance area, most likely behind the visitors’ information building. Sources said that people serving mandatory national service are stationed at the prison entrance, tasked with guarding, assisting visitors, and accompanying prisoners during transfers.

A video posted by state media on July 4 containing clips apparently filmed in the immediate aftermath of the attack shows a large crater caused by the munition in the northwestern angle of the visitors’ information building. A witness who was outside the main entrance immediately after the strikes told Human Rights Watch that they saw a crater at the entrance and several injured and possibly dead people, including those serving mandatory national service.

Shaheed Moghaddas Office of the Prosecutor

Human Rights Watch analyzed two videos and five photographs published by state and international media between June 29 and July 4 depicting destruction to the prosecutorial office within Evin prison, Shaheed Moghaddas Office of the Prosecutor, including a large hole in the ceiling and damage to walls. Leila Jafarzadeh, whose husband was imprisoned in Evin prison, was reported to have been in the prosecutor’s office at the time of the attack to post bail for his release and was killed. State media reported that her body was recovered several days later. Lawyers and others said that during office hours, the prosecutor’s office was packed with prisoners, summoned individuals, prisoners’ families, and lawyers.

Southeastern Corner of the Compound

Human Rights Watch identified, based on a verified video and two photographs, damage to the southeastern corner of the prison compound, including a surrounding wall, and dozens of vehicles parked along the southwestern parking lot.

Strikes in Central Premises

Human Rights Watch analyzed information that shows significant destruction and damage to buildings in the central premises of the compound. Based on satellite imagery analysis, videos, photographs, and accounts of prisoners and informed sources, at least four apparent impact sites were identified in the central section.

The Administrative Building

Videos and images Human Rights Watch analyzed show severe damage to the Administrative Building, in particular its eastern facade and second floor. Damages to an adjacent building, identified by sources who spoke with Human Rights Watch as the prison’s Security/Protection Unit, are also discernible. The unit operates under the head of Iran’s Prisons Organization, which is under the judiciary’s auspices, and based on regulations, is tasked with maintaining prison security, carrying out prisoner transfers, and preventing and controlling riots and escapes.

One verified video published by state media at 5:50 p.m. on June 23 appears to have been taken in the immediate aftermath of the attack. It shows the Administrative Building’s second floor windows completely blown out with debris falling out. Human Rights Watch also reviewed footage posted online on July 6 showing the floors of one section inside the multistorey building collapsed onto one another. A hole is visible in the ceiling above the damaged area.

Several human rights defenders and former Evin prisoners said that the Administrative Building was large, with several floors, including the social workers’ office and a “technology room,” where prisoners permitted to pursue their education would take exams. Domestic media reported that five female social workers at the prison were killed in the strike on the Administrative Building, along with a five-year-old boy.

Satellite imagery and two videos analyzed also show damage to the buildings east of the Administrative Building. Several formerly detained activists and journalists said the damaged building, which some former prisoners said they called the “motori building,” was used to register new prisoners and detainees and process prisoner transfers.

Based on publicly available accounts by prisoners and informed sources, the quarantine section of the prison, used to hold new detainees, adjacent to the “motori” building, was also damaged. Several sources said that transgender prisoners were held there. A verified video published by state media on the day of the attack shows damage to the general area where the quarantine section and a small road leading to Section 2A are located.

The Iranian singer Danial Moghaddam, in a post on his Instagram account, said that he was detained on June 22 and held in room 4 of the prison’s quarantine section. He said that around noon on June 23, as a result of the explosion, parts of the quarantine section’s walls, ceiling, and windows collapsed on prisoners. Moghaddam also said that after exiting the quarantine, he saw casualties and items of clothing under the rubble in the area.

Prison Medical Clinic, Central Kitchen, and Ward 4

The strikes also hit the area north of the prison clinic, severely damaging the clinic and nearby buildings, including Ward 4, the central kitchen, and a covered vehicle passage adjacent to the clinic. A human rights defender imprisoned at Evin until shortly before the attack told Human Rights Watch that besides the medical personnel, “the clinic is always full of prisoners.”

Political prisoners Abolfazl Ghadiani and Mehdi Mahmoudian, in a publicly available account, referred to two or three strikes in proximity to Ward 4. They described damage to Ward 4, the clinic and nearby facilities, and Section 209.

Human Rights Watch analyzed videos and photographs showing damage to the prison clinic and other buildings in the vicinity. One verified video posted online on the day of the attack shows smoke plumes rising from buildings surrounding the clinic. The clinic’s northern facade is burned. Another video, composed of several clips edited together and published by state media on June 25, shows significant damage to the buildings opposite the clinic, including the central kitchen and Ward 4.

Human Rights Watch corroborated videos and photographs of the clinic’s interior and various rooms with former prisoners who had been inside the clinic. The images show damage to a treatment room used for small procedures and injections, the nursing station, a doctor’s consultation room, a laboratory, and the CPR, physiotherapy, and medicine storage rooms.

In a statement published within hours of the strike, Evin prisoners referred to the partial destruction of Ward 4. Two prisoners’ family members said that their imprisoned relatives described damage to Ward 4 and injuries to prisoners. A Ward 4 prisoner, whose statement was obtained by a human rights group and shared with researchers, said that nearby strikes resulted in the collapse of part of the ward’s ceiling and walls.

Section 209 and Storage Building

The strikes on Evin’s central premises damaged a building opposite Section 209. Former prisoners told Human Rights Watch that the building was used for storage, with administrative and management functions for Section 209 in the southern part of the building. Satellite imagery from June 27 shows major destruction to the building, with roof sections collapsed. Debris and burn scars are visible along the road separating the building from Section 209.

Given the proximity between these two buildings, and extensive damage to the storage building, it appears likely that the eastern facade of Section 209 was also severely damaged, most likely exceeding what is visible in the satellite imagery. The Ward 4 prisoner whose account was obtained by a human rights group and shared with Human Rights Watch, said he saw several wounded people or bodies removed from Section 209 and the clinic.

An informed source said that prisoners in the women’s ward, where about 70 political prisoners were held, described a “terrifying blast impact.” An image identified as the ward by former prisoners showed ceiling damage. No other photos or video footage of this area were published. As a result, Human Rights Watch could not independently assess the extent of damages to Section 209 or to the women’s ward.

Northeastern Premises

Visitation Hall and Shaheed Kachoui Judicial Complex

Human Rights Watch identified at least two apparent impact sites in Evin Prison’s northern premises. The strikes destroyed the joint northern entrance to the prison’s visitation hall and Shaheed Kachoui Judicial complex, in the northeastern corner of the compound. Two videos that Human Rights Watch verified and geolocated to Ahmadpour Street, north of the prison compound, show the immediate aftermath of the strike. A shadow analysis indicates they were filmed around noon.

In one video, two men in civilian attire assist another man, dazed and apparently injured. In another, a man in a bloodied shirt is shouting instructions at others while smoke plumes rise from the prison compound.

Human Rights Watch verified another video posted online by state media on June 24 and composed of several clips edited together, showing destruction of the joint entrance, its parking area and the inside of the building. The first clip shows the gate completely destroyed and walls surrounding it significantly damaged. The rest of the video shows damage and destruction inside the building, including the offices of assistant prosecutors and the visitation hall waiting area, strewn with debris and staircases stained with blood.

Informed sources said that offices of assistant prosecutors in the Kachoui complex were on an upper floor of the visitation hall, a larger building stretching south of the compound. They said that the strikes took place during the office and visitation hours, running from 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., when a large number of visitors, including families of prisoners, would have been there. Former prisoners said that the Kachoui complex deals with the judicial affairs of convicted prisoners, including requests for prison leave and conditional release.

Vicinity of Wards 240 and 241

Strikes on the northeastern premises of Evin compound impacted the internal road connecting the north and central sections of the prison. The impact site is less than 20 meters from Sections 240 and 241. A video posted online on June 23 at 3:00 p.m. and verified by Human Rights Watch shows the walls on both sides of the road in front of Sections 240 and 241 almost completely destroyed. Satellite imagery recorded on June 27 also showed a large impact visible on the internal road connecting the north and central sections of the prison.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/08/202508mena_iran_evin_prison.jpg?h=ac778ff2&itok=GesraIlD,N,,2025-08-14 11:56:49.158132

Congress has appropriated more than $21 billion in security assistance for Israel since October 7, 2023.
Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid are not only morally indefensible, they also violate both international and U.S. law.","Dear Members of Congress,

We, the undersigned organizations, write to express our grave concern regarding the preventable humanitarian catastrophe and mass starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip. We urge you to use all available tools, including the suspension of U.S. security assistance in compliance with section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act, in order to secure an immediate surge in humanitarian assistance and an end to the ongoing atrocities. As many of our organizations argued previously, continued U.S. security assistance to Israel despite Israel’s near total siege and restrictions on humanitarian aid is a violation of U.S. law. We urge you to take swift action to comply with the law and end U.S. support for the catastrophic suffering Israel has imposed on Palestinians in Gaza.

As the United Nations and humanitarian organizations have been warning, starvation and the humanitarian crisis are rapidly worsening throughout Gaza. The humanitarian system is being deliberately and systematically dismantled by the Israeli government’s blockade and restrictions. Alarmingly, the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned on July 29 that the worst-case scenario—famine—is currently unfolding in Gaza. In addition, the IPC states that “humanitarian aid remains extremely restricted due to requests for humanitarian access being repeatedly denied and frequent security incidents. Despite the easing of the blockade on 19 May, only a trickle of humanitarian assistance, mainly food, has entered the Gaza Strip.” Food assistance, however, requires extraordinary risks to access. According to the UN Human Rights Office, the Israeli military has killed more than 400 Palestinians and injured more than 3,000 since May 27 while trying to access aid.

Since October 7, 2023, the Israeli government has dramatically tightened restrictions on U.S. humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip. The government has fully blocked the entry of humanitarian aid at various times, most recently between March and May of this year; conducted military strikes on humanitarian workers and sites; destroyed critical infrastructure essential to the survival of the civilian population; implemented a deadly new aid distribution mechanism that reduces the number of distribution sites across Gaza; and repeatedly killed civilians seeking assistance.

Such restrictions and attacks have been documented repeatedly throughout the war and therefore cannot be seen as isolated instances, but the policy of the government of Israel. Human Rights Watch determined that the Israeli government was committing a war crime by using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war in the Gaza Strip; and Oxfam documented war crimes committed by the Israeli government due to its destruction and weaponization of water in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the United States continues to provide Israel with unconditional arms transfers and other military support. Congress has appropriated more than $21 billion in security assistance for Israel since October 7, 2023. In part to fulfill that assistance appropriated by Congress, the Biden and Trump administrations have announced more than $30 billion in potential arms sales, including a sale two months ago for munition guidance kits that have been documented to have been used unlawfully in Gaza.

Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid are not only morally indefensible, they also violate both international and U.S. law. Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. § 2378–1) prohibits the United States from providing security assistance or arms sales to any country that “prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.”

Unconditional U.S. security assistance in violation of the law and continued support for the Israeli government as it restricts aid with impunity has resulted in an engineered humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. We urge you to take all actions at your disposal to end U.S. support for these horrors, enforce U.S. compliance with the law, and use your leverage to bring about an immediate and permanent end to the atrocities, the release of hostages and unlawfully detained prisoners, and access to life-saving humanitarian assistance.

“Ohio counties like Seneca and Geauga cannot hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid obligations under Ohio law.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing a second county, accusing it of violating the state’s open-records law.

The records are contracts and memoranda between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Marshal’s Service and the Department of Homeland Security.

As with some other counties in Ohio, Seneca has contracted with the federal government to detain those swept up in the Trump administration’s mass deportations. The ACLU filed a similar suit against Geauga County in May.

Seneca County is claiming that it’s not allowed to release the records because they “are federal records subject to the Federal Records Act (FRA) and thus not subject to disclosure under state law,” according to the lawsuit filed by the ACLU.

However, open-records laws are intended to combat corruption and other secret dealing by giving the public access to the inner workings of government. As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, would compromise a law enforcement investigation or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.

“The Seneca County Sheriff’s Office has a clear legal duty to provide the requested information,” Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a written statement. “The sheriff’s office has never denied that they possess such records, and there is no provision in Ohio public records law that exempts them from the obligation to produce these records.”

Levenson also said the federal statutes cited by the sheriff’s office don’t exempt the information from disclosure.

“The public has a right to this information,” the statement continued. “Local law enforcement must be accountable; it cannot shroud itself in secrecy.”

The sheriff’s office didn’t immediately respond to a message sent Tuesday afternoon.

Advocates for immigrants have argued that jails are not appropriate places to hold people detained by ICE. For one thing, many — those not accused of illegal entry — are not criminal suspects. For another, there were lawsuits and other problems at Ohio jails under the arrangements during the first Trump administration.

Lynn Tramonte, founder of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, in April listed the harms done to those held in county jails on immigration matters. Such detentions mean “taking them away from their families, jobs, and communities, making them rot in jail, while their immigration cases are pending. Making it harder for them to work with lawyers and win their cases. In the United States, you can be eligible for deportation and legal status at the same time.”

The ACLU of Ohio is asking the state Supreme Court to issue an order mandating that the records it asked for be released. Jocelyn Rosnick, its chief policy and advocacy officer, said sheriffs have to be accountable under state law.

“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” she said. “Ohio counties like Seneca and Geauga cannot hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid obligations under Ohio law. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/icephoto_0-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 09:56:40.690614

Just as he did during his first term in office, President Donald Trump is trying to reshape the census to serve his political goals.

This time, he’s calling for an extraordinary mid-decade population count that would be used for apportioning congressional seats, and that would explicitly exclude undocumented immigrants. He announced his intentions where many of his policy pronouncements start out, on social media.

It’s another effort by his administration to influence redistricting and congressional apportionment in ways that could benefit the GOP, though it’s not clear what the outcome of such a census would be. Democratic-leaning states like California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois have large numbers of undocumented immigrants, but so do some Republican strongholds like Texas and Florida.

Trump’s previous attempt to change census procedures involved the scheduled 2020 census, and ran into a wall at the Supreme Court. This time, he’s trying to do it mid-decade, and for the purposes of apportionment, which would run into many more obstacles.

Here, we address some key questions about Trump’s proposal: the legality, the logistics, and the political strategy driving it.

Can a president order a mid-decade census?

Not unilaterally. The 1790 Census Act governs the census and gives authority over this process to the secretary of commerce and the Census Bureau. Certainly, the president has influence over this part of the executive branch. But Congress still controls the pursestrings and decisions over timing. A process like the one Trump is proposing must be authorized by law and funded through congressional appropriation, which Trump doesn’t control.

What does the constitution say about excluding undocumented residents?

There’s not a lot of ambiguity in the Constitution’s language about the census, or the way the Supreme Court has interpreted it: A census used to determine congressional seats needs to count everyone.

The 14th Amendment requires that the “whole number of persons” residing in the United States should be counted — it doesn’t mention immigration status, or any other condition. The phrase “whole number of persons” was written to replace the Three-Fifths Clause in Article 1 (which said enslaved persons were to be counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of apportionment), and was deliberately written to be inclusive, experts say.

Historical interpretations of this amendment reaffirm that. In 2016, Texas residents challenged the state’s use of total population, rather than just citizens, in deciding how to draw districts of roughly equal size, the process that follows the census and reapportionment of seats among states. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld a ruling that total population was the correct standard, based on the 14th Amendment, saying it “promotes equitable and effective representation.”

“What constitutional history and our prior decisions strongly suggest, settled practice confirms,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. Switching to apportionment based on eligible voters “would upset a well-functioning approach to districting that all 50 States and countless local jurisdictions have followed for decades, even centuries.”

How feasible would a new census be at this time?

It would be very expensive, if it could be done at all, and especially difficult to pull off on Trump’s timeline for influencing next year’s midterm elections. Election administrators, campaigns, and parties have already begun preparations for those elections based on figures from the previous census.

It’s difficult to pull off even when both parties want to do it.

In 1975, there was bipartisan interest in conducting a mid-decade census in order to provide better data for federal programs. Congress passed legislation authorizing a census for data collection only, not for congressional apportionment. But it didn’t get done. It proved too expensive, and the Census Bureau lacked the time and the infrastructure.

Getting Trump’s politically motivated proposal would have a tougher time just getting through Congress. And any attempt to politicize the census would be fraught. The data collected and compiled by the Census Bureau informs not just apportionment and redistricting, but many other public and private endeavors, from emergency planning and housing construction to wildlife conservation and school lunch programs. People and institutions that depend on census data want the most complete picture possible, not one clouded by political motives.

What legal obstacles does Trump face?

Beyond the statutory and constitutional limitations we’ve already talked about, the Census Act limits the White House’s ability to do what Trump is trying to do. And the president has no authority to compel states to draw new maps even if he’s successful at forcing a new census.

Along the way, judging by past disputes, we should expect a deluge of lawsuits that would diminish any chance of a census, reapportionment, and redistricting all getting done in time for next year’s midterms.

Is this related to the current redistricting effort in Texas?

Both reflect efforts by Trump to manipulate regularly scheduled democratic processes for partisan motives.

Redistricting after the census every 10 years has long been a politically driven process, where the party in charge at the state level typically tries to solidify — and perpetuate — its advantage. Texas Republicans did so in 2021, and as we’ve reported, Trump wants them to do it again this year, midway through the cycle, in an attempt to create five new Republican-leaning congressional districts. That way, Trump and his allies figure, Republicans would have a better chance of retaining their narrow majority in the U.S. House after the midterms, when the party in power typically loses seats.

Other states are threatening to do the same, to either help Republicans or try to thwart them.

A midcycle census would effectively broaden this battle for political power to all states. The carve-out for undocumented immigrants in population counts would shift political influence away from large Democratic strongholds, like California, New York, and Illinois, though it could also affect some GOP-dominated states that have large and growing populations of undocumented immigrants.

Hasn’t Trump tried something like this before?

During his first administration, Trump sought to influence the 2020 Census by calling for it to include a citizenship question. His explanation then was that the data was necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act. But others saw it as a first step toward ultimately excluding noncitizens from the population counts used to apportion congressional seats and diminishing the power of states with large immigrant populations.

The Supreme Court ultimately blocked the administration’s effort, ruling that it lacked the authority to push through the change, and the 2020 census went out without the citizenship question. But immigrant rights groups complained that the publicity over that dispute may have compromised the data anyway. They raised concerns that noncitizens, whether they were in the country legally or not, would be afraid to respond to the census. The court battle also compressed the preparation time for the census, leaving less time for people to complete the surveys.

In July 2020, while the census was underway, the White House issued a presidential memorandum directing the Census Bureau to exclude noncitizens in the count it issues for apportionment, even though it had no citizenship question from which to sort out this number. Multiple Democratic-led states sued, arguing that the policy was unworkable and unconstitutional. The courts agreed, and blocked the plan from moving forward.",https://www.votebeat.org/resizer/v2/PK3OVGCPGBBCBLQQEMDWMYUXV4.jpg?smart=true&auth=e54fa26e761799c1f34e1d27f90eedac19b60e829cf38f568ff23d62f0cafc95&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:20.167858

Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell, Mesa County Undersheriff Matthew King, and Mesa County Sheriff's Office Investigations and Special Teams Captain Curtis Brammer are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Rowell et al. v. Weiser et al., which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on Aug. 7. They claim state immigration law is too vague.

Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for the Colorado Attorney General's Office, said in a statement Wednesday to CBS Colorado, ""Colorado law is clear that law enforcement does law enforcement and not federal civil immigration enforcement. It's unfortunate that Mesa County filed this lawsuit. The Department of Law has a responsibility to follow facts and defend and enforce state law. We'll continue to take this duty seriously.""

On June 5, Deputy Alexander Zwinck pulled over Caroline Dias Goncalves for allegedly following another vehicle too closely, and he let her go with a warning. Zwinck reportedly shared the personal information of Dias Goncalves, who is originally from Brazil, in a Signal chat, which included ICE officials, leading to her later detainment by ICE agents.[This track is repeated later. I think it makes more sense to remove this one.]

A few weeks ago, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against a Mesa County sheriff's deputy, who Weiser claims led federal immigration officers to a woman allegedly in the U.S. on an expired visa after a traffic stop. That deputy was allegedly using an encrypted Signal chat with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

Dias Goncalves, a nursing student living in Utah, was detained for more than 2 weeks by ICE and then released. According to Weiser, who is running for governor, she described the experience as ""the worst experience of her life.""

The Mesa County Sheriff's Office has since removed itself from Signal.r

The lawsuit filed in July by Weiser asserts that Zwinck unlawfully asked about, and then shared, the driver's personal identifying information with ICE. Colorado law places limits on the information local law enforcement officials can provide to federal immigration agents.

The Board of Mesa County Commissioners unanimously voted on Aug. 5 to approve the authorization to file the lawsuit against Polis and Weiser to ""protect the constitutional rights of Mesa County employees and to approve the use of public funds for legal representation.""

After the initial lawsuit was filed by Weiser, Rowell apologized for the incident and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/18/65ba2ff4-081c-491f-8e4b-2618bf19571c/thumbnail/1200x630/604c18c7295f82451964392f87809bd6/mesa-county-sheriffs-office-patrol-vehicle.png,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:28.938594

Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have spoken at least five times since Mr. Trump was sworn in for a second term in January, and Russian forces have pushed forward all the while.
Since Mr. Trump took office, many of the U.S. sanctions levied against Russia have weakened, and Mr. Trump did not say on Wednesday if he would strengthen them or come up with something else.
Asked if there would be consequences if Mr. Putin did not take steps to end the war, Mr. Trump answered: “There will be consequences.
“I think he’s one of the greatest talents I’ve ever actually seen,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Crawford on Wednesday.","While crime is a concern for many residents, the situation on the ground differs from Mr. Trump’s hyperbolic statements in justifying the moves: Official data shows that crime is falling — particularly violent crime, which hit a 30-year low last year — after surging during the pandemic.

Mr. Trump, who has stoked fears of violent crimes in America’s cities going back more than 35 years, delivered increasingly dire threats after returning to office in January that if he was not satisfied with the city’s efforts to combat crime, he would order a federal takeover of Washington — in effect dissolving the local government to rule it directly.

Mr. Trump took his first firm steps in that direction last week, after a prominent young administration official was beaten by a mob of young assailants in an attempted carjacking in Washington.

Here’s what to know.

What is Trump doing on law enforcement in Washington? And how is he able to do it?

In the span of a week, Mr. Trump rapidly ratcheted up moves going over the heads of D.C. leaders. He has invoked his authority in overseeing federal law enforcement and a 1973 law that gives the president the power to take temporary control of the city’s police.

He ordered a surge of roughly 500 federal agents into the city beginning last Friday, after the beating of Edward Coristine — an operative of the Department of Government Efficiency — that week.

Then on Monday, Mr. Trump used a provision of the D.C. Home Rule Act, the law that established a local government and granted the city limited autonomy, to temporarily take over the Metropolitan Police Department, the city’s main police force.

A White House official said the current takeover would last 30 days, the maximum outlined in the law before the president must seek an extension of that authority through Congress. Mr. Trump has expressed interest in seeking such an extension.

What powers do federal agents have on city patrols?

On Tuesday, National Guard troops began to deploy in Washington for the first time since 2020, when Mr. Trump ordered a crackdown on Black Lives Matter protests in the city. Unlike the 50 states, D.C. does not control its National Guard unit and has little ability to push back against a federal deployment, as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California did earlier this year.

About a dozen troops were spotted on the National Mall on Tuesday as others gathered at the D.C. Armory, the headquarters of the D.C. National Guard. The initial deployment near the Washington Monument was a far cry from the aggressive policing carried out by the D.C. Guard in 2020. The troops were seen snapping photos of themselves with visitors, and left roughly two hours after they arrived.

One complicating factor of using federal agents to patrol Washington is that those agents do not have the same authority as police officers to arrest people for minor criminal offenses.

Trump administration officials have suggested that if federal agents see someone commit such a crime, they can stop and detain the person until a local police officer arrives and makes an arrest. City officials have said the National Guard troops would not have the authority to make arrests, as the use of the military for civilian law enforcement is limited by the Constitution.

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said this week that the president “has the authority, by virtue of the statute, to request services.” But she said city officials retained the authority to hire and fire people in the Police Department. She added that the police chief would work “hand in hand with the people that the president has designated.”

Could Trump fully take over D.C.?

Even before the current crisis, Mr. Trump held a significant amount of control over D.C. The president nominates the city’s judges and top prosecutor. Much of the City Council’s powers to make laws and plan the annual budget is also subject to congressional oversight.

Mr. Trump in effect exercised his presidential powers to set aside some of the city’s autonomy, declaring a public safety emergency and temporarily commandeering the city’s police force.

In theory, Mr. Trump could go further, with the approval of the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers could extend the emergency, keeping the police under Mr. Trump’s authority for the duration.

Mr. Trump may also be able to keep the National Guard and other federal agents deployed in the city indefinitely. In California, a fraction of the Guard force that Mr. Trump had federalized is still operating under federal control months after being called up.

He could also direct federal units to more forcefully police the city, using tear gas, riot gear, armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft and other aggressive tools and tactics. The White House had previously said that federal agents in the city would be “identified, in marked units, and highly visible,” but those restrictions are not mandated by law, and those units could quickly shift to crack down on city residents.

The most extreme — and most unlikely — outcome is that Mr. Trump calls on Congress to repeal the D.C. Home Rule Act. That would dissolve the local government and place the city directly under federal control. The city’s 700,000 residents — more than the population of Vermont or Wyoming — would lose the ability to elect their mayor and local council members.

Mr. Trump has in recent months expressed support for a federal takeover, and Republicans in both the House and the Senate have introduced legislation to do so. But the chances of those laws passing are still very low. Under current Senate rules, such a law would need 60 votes to advance, and there are only 53 Republicans in the Senate.

Has something like this happened before?

Mr. Trump is the first president to use a declared emergency to wrest control of D.C.’s police. But federal police and the military have previously been deployed in the city, most recently during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.

Mr. Trump had also deployed the National Guard to Washington in 2020 as part of a crackdown on racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

The D.C. Guard was at the forefront of that deployment, which was widely seen as a debacle at the time. Mr. Trump had also considered a deployment of active-duty military units like the 82nd Airborne, and senior Army leaders warned National Guard officers that Army units would replace them on the ground if they were insufficiently aggressive in controlling the protests.

There have been other encroachments on the city’s autonomy during home rule. Before this week, the most significant was a financial control board, established by Congress in 1995 to steer the city out of a fiscal crisis.

Earlier, teams of federal agents and local police officers rolled out of the parking lot of a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast Washington. Scores of National Guard troops gathered on the lawn of the facility by a U.S. Marshals tent, and hundreds of official vehicles filled the parking lot and grass outside the facility in the Anacostia neighborhood.

With about 800 National Guard members, 500 federal law enforcement agents and Washington’s municipal police department, under his command, Mr. Trump, who announced the federal crackdown on crime in the capital on Monday, has vowed that the city would be “essentially crime-free” under his watch.

In the next day or two, the D.C. National Guard will build up to sending out about 100 to 200 soldiers at any given time in support of federal law enforcement officials, Col. Dave Butler, an Army spokesman, said Wednesday. City officials have said the National Guard troops would not have the authority to make arrests. They began arriving on the streets Tuesday evening.

Speaking at the Kennedy Center earlier Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest that he could maintain oversight of crime-fighting in Washington beyond the 30 days that the law allows his administration to be in control of the D.C. police.

While the president has described the city in apocalyptic terms as a crime-infested wasteland, violent crime in Washington fell to a 30-year low last year and has continued to fall sharply this year.

At least 66 people have been arrested in Washington since Monday, according to federal officials. A federal task force that includes some local officers made 23 arrests on Monday evening, said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. On Tuesday, 43 more people were arrested, according to Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director. He said that the F.B.I. had assisted in 18 arrests so far this week, on charges that included unlawful gun possession, assault with a dangerous weapon and theft.

By comparison, in the first 10 days of August 2024, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department made 635 arrests, or about 63 per day, according to department statistics. About 10 percent of those arrested were juveniles. The number of crimes recorded during the first 10 days of August was virtually the same this year as last year.

Washington’s Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, has shifted her stance on the president’s takeover several times, initially criticizing it, then saying she would try to make good use of the federal law enforcement help, then condemning it Tuesday night as an “authoritarian push” and an “intrusion on our autonomy.”

By Wednesday morning, she had softened her tone again and suggested in an interview on Fox 5 Washington that additional federal resources could help drive down crime.

Ms. Bowser deflected questions about whether she believed the president’s crackdown was good for the city and pointed instead to the need for more money to recruit and retain municipal police officers. “To the extent that you see the federal surge creating more arrests, taking more guns, M.P.D. officers would do the same thing,” she said.

When asked where her relationship with the president stood, Ms. Bowser responded: “I’m the mayor, and he’s the president. That’s always been our relationship.”

Katie Rogers and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

Asked whether he could convince Mr. Putin to stop targeting civilians, Mr. Trump said that it was a discussion he had already had with Mr. Putin. Russian forces have pounded Ukrainians with drones and missiles, sending civilians scrambling for shelter. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have spoken at least five times since Mr. Trump was sworn in for a second term in January, and Russian forces have pushed forward all the while.

“I’ve had a lot of good conversations with him,” Mr. Trump told a reporter during an appearance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington — one that was originally about announcing this year’s class of Kennedy Center honorees. “Then I go home and I see that a rocket hit a nursing home, or a rocket hit an apartment building and people are laying dead in the street. So I guess the answer to that is no, because I’ve had this conversation.”

Mr. Trump struck a similar tone when asked if he had seen reporting in The New York Times on Tuesday that Russia was behind a widespread breach of federal court systems. The system that was exposed holds highly sensitive records with information that could reveal sources and people charged with national security crimes.

“Are you surprised? You know?” Mr. Trump said. “That’s what they do. They’re good at it. We’re good at it. We’re actually better at it.”

He was also asked if he planned to bring up the reporting with Mr. Putin, but did not answer.

Mr. Trump has long bragged about his ability to make deals and use tough talk to get his way, but his relative softness toward Mr. Putin has long perplexed analysts. Some view the latest meeting as a haphazardly planned get-together that risks damaging American interests and blunting the power of the presidency, if Mr. Trump returns to Washington empty-handed.

“His rhetorical posture is completely acquiescent,” said Michael A. McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia under President Barack Obama. “The risk is that it makes the leader of the United States of America, the most powerful person in the world, look weak.”

When he has spoken of helping end the war, Mr. Trump has so far repeated proposals floated by the Russians, such as a swap of territory that could include the entire eastern region known as the Donbas, an idea already flatly rejected by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he had held a call with European leaders, including Mr. Zelensky, and that the Ukrainian president would be included in a quick follow-up meeting if everything went well. But even on that point, Mr. Trump doubled back.

“Now there may be no second meeting,” Mr. Trump said. “Because if I feel that it’s not appropriate to have it, because I didn’t get the answers that we have to have, then we’re not going to have a second meeting.”

Fiona Hill, who served as senior director for European and Russian affairs in the National Security Council during Mr. Trump’s first term, said that Mr. Trump was not the only leader taking a risk by taking the meeting. Mr. Putin’s campaign against Ukraine has extended far longer than he anticipated, a miscalculation that has chipped away at the idea that he is a grand strategist, Ms. Hill said.

There is the risk, she added, that Mr. Trump again loses patience with the peacemaking process, as he has in recent weeks.

“Maybe we’re getting there, where that view of Putin is going to shift,” Ms. Hill said of Mr. Trump. “And that is dangerous for Putin.”

Still, without Mr. Zelensky present, the conditions of the coming meeting favor Mr. Putin, who had issued the invitation to Mr. Trump to meet. Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., viewed Mr. Putin a “war criminal,” issuing sanctions meant to cripple the finances of the Russian leader and those around him. But on Friday, Mr. Trump will fly across the country to welcome Mr. Putin to an American military base to see what he has in mind.

That laid-back approach — Mr. Trump earlier this week described it as a “feel-out meeting” — seemed to conflict with his threat that Mr. Putin may actually face consequences if he does not agree to end the war. Since Mr. Trump took office, many of the U.S. sanctions levied against Russia have weakened, and Mr. Trump did not say on Wednesday if he would strengthen them or come up with something else.

Asked if there would be consequences if Mr. Putin did not take steps to end the war, Mr. Trump answered: “There will be consequences. I don’t have to say. There will be very severe consequences.”

Much of the leverage Mr. Trump could have used with Mr. Putin might have come in the weeks leading up to the meeting, said Steven Pifer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Trump had expressed public frustration over Mr. Putin’s ignoring his calls to halt his offensive against the Ukrainians.

But so far, none of the threats have materialized into the kind of punishments that could force Mr. Putin to change course. Mr. Trump could have chosen to divert some $300 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets to Ukraine, Mr. Pifer said, or could have prioritized the production and shipment of American weapons purchased by the Europeans to maximize quick assistance to Kyiv. Mr. Trump has done none of those things, instead wondering aloud if “tariffs and stuff” might be the solution.

“You’re not going to get Putin to change course until he concludes he cannot achieve his goals on the battlefield,” Mr. Pifer said. “Had Trump wisely used that leverage and persuaded Putin that this would start happening, he would have dealt himself some cards.”

But by a 2-to-1 vote, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, only the Government Accountability Office, which serves as Congress's independent watchdog, could challenge the president’s efforts to withhold foreign aid funding. The panel found that groups that receive government funding — in this instance, a number of global health nonprofits — do not have cause to challenge Mr. Trump’s funding cuts.

The decision lifted a lower court’s order that had required the administration to continue processing foreign aid payments with funds Congress had budgeted.

In finding that the Trump administration had unlawfully delayed money Congress appropriated, a lower court previously required the government to make available all the foreign assistance funds Congress allocated for fiscal year 2024.

That included nearly $4 billion to spend on global health activities until September, and more than $6 billion for H.I.V./AIDS programs through 2028. The decision on Wednesday noted that the administration had “paid out substantially all the amounts owed on existing contracts” as required by the lower court ruling.

Barring further action from the courts, the ruling gave the Trump administration leeway to slash the funds, cut the agencies that administer foreign assistance programs and terminate entire aid programs that Congress had funded.

On numerous occasions this year, the Government Accountability Office has found that the Trump administration illegally impounded funds authorized by Congress, including money meant for public infrastructure and early child education. By June, the legislative watchdog also had more than 40 additional investigations underway, with some of the impoundment inquiries focused on the government’s handling of foreign aid, according to documents previously viewed by The Times.

Under the law, the accountability office has the power to sue to force the release of impounded funds, but it has not done so thus far, letting lawsuits launched by outside groups play out. The agency’s leader, Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, previously described a legal challenge as a last resort.

Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, the president of the Global Health Council, one of the groups involved in the lawsuit, said the organization would continue to fight to make the funding available again.

“While today’s decision is very disappointing, Global Health Council will continue our efforts to protect the global health sector and the critical work being done around the world,” she said in a statement.

Wednesday’s ruling was the latest in a series of decisions by appeals courts that have in recent weeks overturned efforts by lower court judges to curb sweeping actions by Mr. Trump.

On his first day in office, President Trump announced a review of the country’s foreign aid policies. At the same time, he froze foreign development assistance and humanitarian aid while top aides, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, began dismantling the United States Agency for International Development, the main U.S. aid agency, and carried out a campaign to end funding for global projects.

Days later, the Trump administration also placed a moratorium on new funding for projects administered by the State Department or U.S.A.I.D. Both agencies followed by suspending or terminating thousands of grants and denying invoices.

A number of foreign aid nonprofits that had for years depended on federal funding filed lawsuits early this year, arguing that President Trump had overstepped his authority and usurped Congress’s power over spending.

Lower court judges in several cases agreed, finding that in unilaterally shutting down various funding streams, the Trump administration violated the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. In March, Judge Amir H. Ali of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia blocked the cuts involving foreign aid and ordered the Trump administration to keep paying out funds Congress had set aside.

Judge Karen L. Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, who wrote Wednesday’s majority opinion, said the federal law lays out a clear process for challenging impoundment, requiring the head of the G.A.O. to sue on Congress’s behalf. She wrote that the grant recipients who had brought the early lawsuits in February could not, therefore, rely on the claim that Mr. Trump had exceeded his authority.

Lawsuits challenging the president, she wrote, “cannot be recast as constitutional claims through the mere invocation of the separation of powers.”

Judge Gregory G. Katsas, a Trump appointee, voted along with Judge Henderson.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wrote that courts can and should still scrutinize instances in which a president appeared to have unlawfully overridden Congress. She said that applied even though Congress has tasked the head of the G.A.O. with bringing claims under the impoundment act.

“The court’s holding that the grantees have no constitutional cause of action is as startling as it is erroneous,” she wrote. “The majority holds that when the president refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells.”

Tony Romm contributed reporting.

Mr. Trump’s announcement, which he made from the Kennedy Center, is his first since he purged the renowned concert venue of its Biden-appointed board members, fired the center’s president and made himself chairman.

It revealed his growing influence over the center and its programs as well as his veto power over the list of honorees. He had personally approved each of the recipients, he said, and rejected several other suggested artists because they were “wokesters.”

But while some of this year’s recipients have expressed support for Mr. Trump, the list doesn’t read like a blatantly political roster.

George Strait, country king

Mr. Strait, who was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006, is credited with helping to bring country music back to a more traditional sound, at a time when the genre was gravitating toward pop influence. Mr. Strait, a Texan, looks as well as sounds the part of a country music legend, having preferred a signature urban cowboy style since his first breakout hits in the 1980s. In the decades since, he has enjoyed remarkable success, racking up 60 No. 1 hit songs on the country charts — the most of any artist in any genre.

Gloria Gaynor, disco queen

Ms. Gaynor, who was inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame in 2005, is one of the most recognizable voices of the disco movement that peaked in the United States during the 1970s. Her popularity, however, has far outlasted that era, thanks to the lasting commercial success of her biggest hit, “I Will Survive” — which also seems to be a personal favorite of Mr. Trump’s.

“Unbelievable song,” Mr. Trump quipped during his announcement, adding that “it’s one of those few that get better every time you hear it.” The song is so recognizable and popular that it has occasionally been repurposed as an anti-Trump anthem, including in 2017, when celebrities recorded themselves singing it in anticipation of Mr. Trump’s first inauguration.

Kiss, hard rock and heavy makeup

Kiss, known beyond its fan base for its members’ face paint, elaborate costumes and stage performances that feature theatrics and pyrotechnics, has had its style alternatively described as hard rock, heavy metal, glam rock and glam metal. Regardless of classification, the group, which formed in the 1970s, had a huge influence on bands that followed, helping to popularize grandiose live performances. Kiss, which continues to enjoy significant commercial success and crossover appeal, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.

Michael Crawford, the original Phantom

Mr. Crawford might not be a household name in the United States, but the decorated British stage actor has originated and popularized a series of iconic roles in musical theater. He was the original Phantom in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Phantom of the Opera” when it premiered in London, and won a Tony Award for the role after it moved to Broadway. Long before that, he sang the role of Cornelius Hackl in the 1969 film version of “Hello, Dolly!” starring Barbra Streisand.

“I think he’s one of the greatest talents I’ve ever actually seen,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Crawford on Wednesday.

Sylvester Stallone, action hero

For many moviegoers, Mr. Stallone’s visage is synonymous with title roles he popularized in two franchises that produced multiple films and more than $1 billion in revenue: Rocky, about a hapless Philadelphia boxer who becomes the heavyweight champion, and Rambo, about an Army special forces veteran of the Vietnam War who fights bad guys, including corrupt cops.

In addition to his film credentials, Mr. Stallone is a stalwart supporter of Mr. Trump, whom he called “the second George Washington” shortly after his election in November. Mr. Trump has also designated Mr. Stallone one of three “special ambassadors” to Hollywood, tasked with bringing film production that has been taking place overseas to the United States.

Mr. Farage confirmed the meeting, saying in a statement: “Good to catch up with my old friend JD Vance this morning. Everything we discussed remains confidential.”

Earlier, the official said, Mr. Vance met Robert Jenrick, a Conservative lawmaker who is viewed a rising force on the right flank of the Conservative Party. But he did not meet the party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, an omission that both sides chalked up to logistical hurdles.

“The vice president met with a number of people during his trip to the United Kingdom,” Mr. Vance’s press secretary, Taylor Van Kirk, said in a statement. “He specifically tried to see Kemi Badenoch — a friend of his — but a meeting was not possible due to their scheduling conflicts.”

The vice president’s office also declined to disclose what Mr. Vance and Mr. Farage talked about. But the two share common ground on issues like free-speech rights, which both have claimed are under threat in Britain.

Mr. Jenrick, who endorsed President Trump before the American election, has likewise raised alarms over what he has described as an erosion of free expression under Britain’s Labour government.

“The left’s determination to shut down debate around immigration has created a chilling environment for free speech,” Mr. Jenrick said recently, in language that hews closely to Mr. Vance’s views.

In meeting Mr. Farage and Mr. Jenrick in the Cotswolds, a picturesque region west of London, the vice president got a glimpse of the intense battle for the right that is now raging in British politics. It was also a chance for two rivals to vie for validation from a potential heir to Mr. Trump’s MAGA movement.

“It’s difficult to see Vance’s failure to meet with Badenoch as any other than a calculated snub to her and a vote of confidence in Jenrick,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.

Mr. Jenrick, Professor Bale said, “couldn’t make it more obvious that he wants her job if he tried and is well on the road to becoming a MAGA-friendly — indeed, MAGA-style — right-wing culture warrior.”

Mr. Jenrick has fashioned himself as an immigration hard-liner and is viewed by political analysts as a potential challenger to Ms. Badenoch as Tory leader. She has struggled to stabilize the Conservative Party’s poll ratings since its devastating defeat to Labour in a general election last summer.

In a recent column in The Mail on Sunday, Mr. Jenrick said he supported those who protest outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. Last summer, these hotels became targets for violent attacks after a British son of Rwandan migrants killed three young girls in a stabbing rampage.

“I care more for my daughters’ safety than the rights of foreign criminals,” Mr. Jenrick wrote, drawing a mocking reply from Mr. Farage, who claims the Conservatives are to blame for a wave of illegal immigration.

“Your party let 100,000 of them into the UK,” Mr. Farage posted on social media, referring to asylum seekers, many of whom cross the English Channel in rickety boats. “No wonder you’re frightened for the safety of your daughters, Robert.”

During a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office in February, Mr. Vance alluded to the arrest of people for posting inflammatory material on platforms like Facebook or X, saying it threatened “American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens.”

On this visit, Mr. Vance has softened his tone. That may reflect a desire not to spoil Mr. Trump’s planned state visit in September, as well as the fact that Mr. Vance was being hosted by Mr. Lammy, a minister in Mr. Starmer’s government, at a government-owned estate, Chevening, in Kent.

In addition to his political meetings, the vice president has been immersed in planning for Mr. Trump’s meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia later this week. On Wednesday afternoon, he joined a video conference call with Mr. Trump, European leaders and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

After Mr. Vance leaves the Cotswolds, he plans to travel to Scotland, following Mr. Trump, who visited his golf courses there last month. There were other echoes of the boss on Mr. Vance’s social schedule.

He invited Thomas Skinner, a pillow salesman who appeared on the British version of Mr. Trump’s reality show, “The Apprentice,” to a barbecue on Tuesday evening. Mr. Skinner posted a picture of himself and the vice president, writing, “Cracking night in the beautiful English countryside with JD, his friends and family. Once in a lifetime. Bosh.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/13/multimedia/13Trump-news-promo-245am-pltc/13Trump-news-promo-245am-pltc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:25.221033

According to court documents, the family was detained during a routine ICE check-in and later transported to an airport for deportation.
The complaint states that the mother was not informed that her attorney was attempting to contact her, nor that her husband was seeking custody of their U.S. citizen daughter.
""The media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told Newsweek.

The complaint contends that the deportation occurred without adequate notice, legal counsel, or arrangements for the child's ongoing medical care.

Why It Matters

Immigration authorities have been under heightened scrutiny amid allegations of misconduct, with the agency at the center of the national debate over immigration policy. That spotlight has widened since President Donald Trump ordered a ramp-up in arrests to fulfill his pledge of mass deportations, prompting renewed questions about the legality and human impact of ICE's enforcement practices.

What To Know

Though they are U.S. citizens and were born in Louisiana, the boy and his 7-year-old sister were deported to Honduras along with their 25-year-old mother, who is a Honduran citizen, on April 25, according to a federal lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The filing uses pseudonyms for the family, referring to the brother and sister as ""Romeo"" and ""Ruby"" and their mother as ""Rosario.""

Before their deportations, Romeo, now 5, was receiving ""life-saving"" treatment at a New Orleans children's hospital for his ""rare and aggressive form"" of cancer, following his diagnosis at age 2, a complaint says.

""It has been scary and overwhelming,"" Rosario said in a press release on July 31.

""As a direct consequence of ICE's unlawful conduct, Romeo was deprived of much-needed continuity in his treatment, and he has faced substantial health risks due to his inability to access emergency specialized care and the routine critical oncological care that was available to him in the United States,"" the family's attorneys wrote in court documents.

According to court documents, the family was detained during a routine ICE check-in and later transported to an airport for deportation. The complaint states that the mother was not informed that her attorney was attempting to contact her, nor that her husband was seeking custody of their U.S. citizen daughter.

Court filings also allege that the family was held in a van for approximately five hours without communication and later returned to a hotel, still without the ability to contact anyone outside their immediate environment. The complaint asserts that the deportations were executed without providing the family an opportunity to arrange for the care of the children, including the young boy undergoing treatment for advanced kidney cancer.

The lawsuit is being brought by the National Immigration Project, Gibson Dunn, Most & Associates, and Ware Immigration on behalf of Romeo's family and a second family who, according to the filing, were deported by ICE under similar circumstances on April 25.

The second family is identified in court documents as including ""Julia,"" a 30-year-old mother from Honduras, and her two daughters, ""Jade,"" age 2, a U.S. citizen born in Baton Rouge, and ""Janelle,"" age 11, a Honduran citizen. All names in the filing are pseudonyms.

The lawsuit alleges that ICE did not give Rosario or Julia the opportunity to decide whether their children would accompany them to Honduras or remain in the United States with other family members.

""The media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, told Newsweek.

""This is false and irresponsible. Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates. The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras,"" she said.

""Further, when there is an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement. ICE ALWAYS prioritizes the health, safety, and well-being of all detainees in its care,"" she added.

The lawsuit, J.L.V. v. Acuna, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, names Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE and ICE Director Todd Lyons, as well as New Orleans ICE Field Office Director Brian Acuna, Assistant Field Office Director Scott Ladwig, and the office's former director, Mellissa Harper, as defendants.

The lawsuit requests the immediate return of the family to the United States, as well as recognition of their legal rights and compensation for damages.

Media reports note some discrepancies in the boy's age. While several outlets have referred to him as 5, court documents list him as 4 years old at the time of deportation.

What People Are Saying

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: ""DHS takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected. Parents, who are here illegally, can take control of their departure. Through the CBP Home App—the Trump Administration is giving parents illegally in the country a chance to take full control of their departure and self-deport, with the potential ability to return the legal, right way and come back to live the American dream. It is free and available for all mobile devices.""

National Immigration Project attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones told McClatchy News: ""ICE put these families through a series of incredibly traumatizing experiences, taking actions that are completely shocking from a human perspective and illegal even by ICE's own standards.""

Rosario said in a press release: ""After so many years in the United States, it has been devastating to be sent to Honduras. Life in Honduras is incredibly hard. I don't have the resources to care for my children the way they need. Since returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I've been struggling with my own health issues too. I was diagnosed with high anxiety and prescribed medication for stress. It's not the same as living in your own country. It's been painful every step of the way.""

Sirine Shebaya, Executive Director of the National Immigration Project, said in a press release: ""ICE's actions in this case are not only unlawful, they are cruel and show a complete disregard for family values and the well-being of children.""

Court documents read: ""Romeo needs regular specialized care and follow-up treatment to this day.""

After leaving the military, Barco served 15 years in prison for attempted murder, according to Stout and Barco’s attorney.
Barco’s advocates and attorneys say they fear he will be deported to Venezuela or Cuba, where he has family ties.","AURORA, Colo. (KDVR) — A Colorado combat war veteran who is being held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Aurora is anxiously waiting to see if he will be deported to a country where his attorneys say he could be tortured.

That combat veteran came to this country legally when he was four years old and later served in the military, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. How much longer 39-year-old Jose Barco must stay at the ICE detention facility in Aurora is now in the hands of an immigration judge.

That judge will decide whether Barco will be deported or have his removal deferred, according to Barco’s attorney. That attorney and an advocate spoke after Barco’s hearing at the detention center.

“This is a punishment that could result in his indefinite detention, torture and potential loss of his life,” Advocate Anna Stout said.

Barco came to the United States legally with his parents from Venezuela when he was four years old. He later joined the military and was stationed in Colorado Springs, and served two tours in Iraq, where he was injured in combat. He applied for citizenship status while deployed in 2006, but his representatives said his paperwork was lost.

His representatives said his family fled Cuba and went to Venezuela after his father was exiled before coming to the United States as political refugees. Barco has no ties in Venezuela or Cuba, which his advocates say further puts him at an elevated risk if he were to be removed to either country, according to Stout.

“The crux of this case is the fact that we shouldn’t be here today. This should not be a US veteran in removal proceedings because he should have been made a us citizen as this country promised him when he went to war for us and when he fought for us and bled for us,” Stout said.

After leaving the military, Barco served 15 years in prison for attempted murder, according to Stout and Barco’s attorney.

ICE arrested him immediately after he was paroled. Barco’s advocates and attorneys say they fear he will be deported to Venezuela or Cuba, where he has family ties.

“It’s unimaginable. He is being judged off one of his worst days instead of a lot of good things he had in the United States as far as serving the country,” Barco’s wife, Tia Barco, said.

His attorneys are asking that his deportation be deferred under a treaty designed to prevent torture. They say they fear he would be tortured because of his military service.

Attorneys say a better place might be a facility in Mexico, where he could get treatment for his PTSD and his past suicidal ideations. But the goal is to have him released in the U.S. until his future is more stable and secure.

A judge could rule on this case any day now, according to his attorney.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/08/96489C5DCE2AE6D2BA7B1CD1C6C4D91C.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-14 05:56:47.295079

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush’s solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government’s lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.",https://molawyersmedia.com/files/2025/08/Thomas-Cullen.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 09:57:31.726032

So far in 2025, ICE has arrested at least 1,032 people in Washington. July’s tally marked a slight decline from June, when the agency reported 275 arrests — the highest monthly total this year. From January through May, monthly totals ranged from 84 to 137.

The state’s trends mirror national figures showing fewer arrests in July but more deportations. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported an average of 84 more removals per day in July compared to June.

ICE also “encountered” at least 909 people in Washington in July, up from 818 in June. The agency defines an encounter as any instance in which it considers taking enforcement action against a person.

In recent weeks, organizers cancelled two major local events celebrating Hispanic and Latino culture, citing “safety concerns” and a recent uptick in ICE raids.

Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars.
The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.","WHITEFISH, MT – A man who was held in a federal detention facility after Whitefish police pulled him over for an allegedly faulty taillight in April has filed a lawsuit alleging racial profiling and a violation of his constitutional rights against the city of Whitefish, Whitefish Police Chief Bridger Kelch, and Officer Michael Hingiss, who conducted the traffic stop.

Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.

Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.

In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”

According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.

Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.

“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.

Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”

“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”

According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”

The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.

During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.

Every year, it encourages community members to document incidents of abuse inflicted by local, state, and federal law enforcement not only along the U.S.-Mexico border but in the interior of Mexico.

The campaign runs for two months and includes setting up tables near ports of entry, as well as in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with typically high immigrant populations, from Albuquerque to Del Rio, Texas.

BNHR plans to present its findings in October.

In this week’s episode of Border Report Live, correspondent Julian Resendiz speaks with BNHR Executive Director Fernando Garcia about the abuse documentation campaign and what changes the group could see this time around. The group says they’ve already gotten first-hand accounts of abusive behavior from President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Every year, it encourages community members to document incidents of abuse inflicted by local, state, and federal law enforcement not only along the U.S.-Mexico border but in the interior of Mexico.

The campaign runs for two months and includes setting up tables near ports of entry, as well as in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with typically high immigrant populations, from Albuquerque to Del Rio, Texas.

BNHR plans to present its findings in October.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.

It’s time to talk about women’s economics with attitude. It’s time to laugh at what is often absurd and call out what is dangerous. By focusing on voices not typically part of mainstream man-to-man economic discourse, Women Unscrewing Screwnomics will bring you news of hopeful and practical changes and celebrate an economy waged as life—not as war.

Remember the old days, when here in America, you were innocent until proven guilty? Right now, a presumption of war is entering every corner of our land of the free, from trade wars to bloody wars in Ukraine to Gaza, and political wars between Texas vs. California and Illinois about illegal threats of gerrymandering.

Reserve forces of the U.S. Army, 800 National Guardsmen, and (for some reason) 120 FBI agents, are being newly assigned by El Presidente to patrolling our national capital. He cites crime as his motive, which has dropped by a third in recent (Biden) years.

He’s done this kind of deployment already in Los Angeles for the last 60 days and predicts other cities are on his list: Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York City—all places that just happen to vote blue and elect Democrats.

Governor “Newscum”—yes, that’s what our nation’s top executive at his Aug. 11 news conference, called the top executive of our biggest state economy, the fourth biggest economy in the world—just requested on Aug. 6 that the federal government “provide the total cost to taxpayers for this unlawful deployment of 5,000 soldiers.”

Early on, the Pentagon testified to Congress that it would spend, oh, just about $134 million for the LA deployment.

I’m just a mom—one of those “people that people come out of,” as Pete Hegseth’s pastor recently described us women—but it seems to me that this estimate low-balls the price of fixing three meals a day with groceries these days, as well as transporting and lodging 5,000 hungry young men.

A federal court is currently hearing arguments in the case of Newsom v. Trump, with the state’s attorneys presenting evidence that the LA deployment was unlawful. An amicus brief has been filed on behalf of a bipartisan group of 25 former governors, who alone once had the sole authority to deploy their state’s National Guard.

So, is this the “political theater” that Newsom claims? If it is, its cost is something Congress, the so-called People’s House, with control of the nation’s purse, should take into account. If it isn’t, they are still responsible for how our money is spent. This Congress in particular should be accountable for government efficiency—or as DOGE might put it, waste and abuse.

California’s economy is expected to contract later this year, thanks to cruel immigration raids and global tariffs affecting construction, hospitality and agriculture, according to a UCLA forecast. These are industries our whole nation depends on. Did I mention those grocery prices?

Deportations, mass arrests and the cost of detention are estimated to cost California alone $275 billion, along with lost tax revenue of another $23 billion. In 2022, so-called “illegals” alone paid $8.5 billion in state and local taxes. If they could work lawfully, that figure would rise significantly.

“Working lawfully” brings to my mind our nation’s first concentration camp, playfully named Alligator Alcatraz. It’s placed on an old airstrip in the Florida Everglades and is a sad example of federal/state cooperation.

The federal government will reportedly send prisoners, but the state and FEMA and the U.S. Park Service built it and collaborate to run it. So, what genius among this clique of spite thought it “efficient” to air-condition tents parked where humid summer temperatures range in the 90s? What is that cost?

We only have a reported annual budget of $450 million a year to hold its current 600 migrants. That’s about $7,500 a year for each prisoner, half the lowest U.S. prison system’s annual cost—so excuse me for doubting official numbers again.

This compares with sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell’s recent new country-club minimum security accommodations at federal prison Camp Bryan. It’s located on 37 acres in Texas that looks like a golf course and costs approximately $55,172.30 per prisoner per year.

Of the 600 migrants in Florida’s Alcatraz, two-thirds of them are without any criminal record, a Miami Herald investigation found. Florida’s current regime projects it will grow in future to hold 3,000 people. So, is it fair to assume we’ll be spending at least $1.25 billion annually on this one facility in future? Not for at least two weeks, it seems, as a judge just ordered construction there stop, while she considers environmental damage concerns.

Reportedly “substandard” and “inadequate” food is shipped into the place by tractor trailers, and now some prisoners are reportedly refusing to eat, due to worms and such. Multiple lawsuits have been filed concerning prisoner conditions like unconstitutional “cruel and unusual punishment” and their lack of access to their lawyers. There’s another federal lawsuit filed by environmental group that argues the state and its governor, Ron DeSantis, “has bulldozed over federal rules for assessing environmental harm within Big Cypress National Preserve.” where Alligator Alcatraz is located.

Oh, but then the earth does appear to be getting warmer. Alligator Alcatraz’s Everglade utilities, like power for running water, sewers and air conditioning, are provided by mobile equipment. I’m going to predict we’ll need to buy much bigger mobile power utilities and air conditioners soon, just to avoid killing people in our tents in our national park prison there. But maybe that’s this regime’s goal?

Which raises another cost of our cruelties. If you are as sick about this as I am, it’s hard to admit these cruelties are “ours,” so long as we’re paying with our tax dollars. What are the costs of the multiple lawsuits challenging our Justice Department for their administration’s unlawful behavior? Is this really what we want our government to be defending?

We know that the so-called Department of Homeland Security had a hole in its pocket leaking more money than it had—or possibly a hole in the head of its chief executive, the puppy killing, horse-riding Dakota cowboy, wearing a Rolex. She needed and got an historic appropriation of $165 billion in H.1, the Republican budget bill, and now expects to pay ICE and Border Patrol agents a $10,000 yearly bonus, thanks to this raise from a Republican-led Congress.

More prisons, more ICE officials, and more money for more lawsuits is needed to defend ICE-y Homeland cruelties.

After the midterms, this new ICE bonus expense will be partially paid by those who can least afford it: Medicaid patients and food stamp shoppers.

Do I need to remind you that women and mothers are a big portion of these folks? And that your local hospital and grocery store will feel the hit too? The rest of this big, not-so-beautiful bill will be financed by our growing national federal debt and a dollar that is losing value.

Thankfully, Lawfare reports that there are now 321 active cases challenging Trump administration actions. The New York Times is now tracking the lawsuits against this regime. Lawsuits have been a rising trend since Reagan, but the number of lawsuits in this administration’s first six months promises to set a new and unsettling record.

“Hundreds [of suits] have been filed by state attorneys and media organizations, physicians and nonprofits, migrants, international students, law firms and unions, concerning immigration, tariffs, birthright citizenship, funding cuts and the Alien Enemies Act, DOGE, Firings, Climate, Funding Cuts, Trans Rights, Access to federal property, and others,” according to The New York Times.

As a general rule, the U.S. legal system holds “The American Rule,” which says each party in a lawsuit typically pays their own attorney’s fees regardless of who wins. This intends to promise access to the law by ensuring everyone’s ability to pursue claims without fear of incurring significant costs from the opposing side. But what does it mean when you’re facing off with the richest and most powerful class that has bought our politicians?

What does it mean when I am rooting for “The American Rule’s” side that is suing my own government?",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229579545.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:06.989398

""Time and again, this administration has shown their disdain for foreign assistance and a disregard for people's lives in the United States and around the world.","A federal appeals court handed President Trump a victory on Wednesday. The court ruled that the administration can continue to freeze or terminate billions of dollars that Congress had earmarked for foreign aid spending.

In a 2-to-1 vote, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the plaintiffs in the case, a group of international aid groups, did not have the legal standing to bring a lawsuit.

Theforeign aid freeze was an action the President took on his very first day in office in January.

The money in question includes nearly $4 billion for global health programs through September and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs through 2028.

President Trump has called foreign aid spending on programs that tackle disease outbreaks and poverty overseas ""wasteful.""The administration dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development which oversaw and managed about $30 billion annually in global health and development programs.

A group of international aid groups that were recipients of foreign aid grants sued the administration on February 10, and in March U.S. district judge Amir Ali issued a preliminary injunction against the funding freeze, saying that the administration had unlawfully frozen funds that were allocated by Congress.

Wednesday's ruling reversed the lower court's preliminary injunction, but the panel of judges did not rule on whether the terminations of funds appropriated by Congress were constitutional.

""The grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,"" wrote Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, an appointee of George H.W. Bush. She was joined by Judge Gregory G. Katsas, a Trump appointee.

Judge Florence Pan, who was appointed by Joe Biden, wrote the dissenting opinion.

""The court's holding that the grantees have no constitutional cause of action is as startling as it is erroneous,"" Pan wrote. ""The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells.""

In a statement, Mitchell Warren, the executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) – one of the aid groups in the lawsuit challenging the freeze – condemned the ruling.

""Time and again, this administration has shown their disdain for foreign assistance and a disregard for people's lives in the United States and around the world. More broadly, this decision, which we will appeal to the extent possible, further erodes Congress's role and responsibility as an equal branch of government, and the majority opinion makes the court complicit,"" Warren said.

Takeover—and Break the Law | The New Republic,Robert McCoy,,,,,https://newrepublic.com/post/199064/trump-determined-extend-dc-takeover-and-break-law,"Three days into his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., Trump said he plans to extend the crackdown beyond its month-long limit—with or without congressional approval.
The man at the head of President Trump’s cruel, indiscriminate immigration crackdown also has perplexingly bad taste in condiments, according to his wife.
Sudden federal takeovers of America’s cities will apparently be the new normal under the Trump administration.
“He’s gonna do more of them,” one Trump administration official told Rolling Stone, referring to wielding the military against the nation’s metropolises.
Prior to entering the fold of the Trump administration, Antoni worked as the Heritage Foundation’s chief economist and helped develop Project 2025.","Three days into his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., Trump said he plans to extend the crackdown beyond its month-long limit—with or without congressional approval.

The president on Wednesday was asked if he considers the 30-day timeframe during which he’s allowed, under the Home Rule Act, to control D.C.’s police before needing Congress’s OK as sufficient to address his imagined crime spike.

Before today, his administration’s answer to this question was seemingly yes; a White House official has said the operation is “expected to last 30 days.”

Now Trump is looking to extend it.

The president indicated Wednesday that his plan A is to put a “crime bill” before Congress “very quickly.” The bill, he said, will “pertain, initially, to D.C.” and ask “for extensions on that—long-term extensions, because you can’t have 30 days.” Trump noted that he expects unanimous Republican support for this (though, as Semafor reports, Senate Democrats seem able and committed to block an extension).

But Trump also expressed his willingness to bypass Congress to draw out the takeover. “Well, if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,” he said, adding that while he expects all Republicans to fall in line, “if I have to [call a national emergency], I will.”

Trump has flogged national emergency power more than any other recent president, exhibiting, per libertarian legal scholar Ilya Somin, “a dangerous pattern of invoking spurious emergencies to undermine the Constitution, threatening liberty and circumventing Congress.” So far during his second term, he’s declared a dozen such national emergencies—and is apparently ready to add to that list in order to impose his will, unchecked, on the American people.

The man at the head of President Trump’s cruel, indiscriminate immigration crackdown also has perplexingly bad taste in condiments, according to his wife.

Katie Miller, herself a former Trump aide, hosted Vice President JD Vance on her new self-titled podcast aimed toward right-wing women. The conversation turned to a classic icebreaker question.

“If you could only eat one condiment for the rest of your life what would it be?” Miller asked Vance.

“One condiment?” Vance asked.

“Yeah.”

“Does barbecue sauce count?”

“Yeah.”

“Ok. Barbecue sauce.”

“Not mayonnaise?” Miller asked, entirely unprompted.

“No,” Vance said, with a look of slight repulsion. “Mayonnaise is like … in low doses it’s good, but it’s kind of … like I had a buddy who used to eat french fries with mayonnaise. I thought that was disgusting.”

“It’s the only thing my husband eats,” Miller said plainly.

“With french fries, or like period?”

“Period.”

“OK, wow. Didn’t realize.”

“Yeah he’s only a mayonnaise guy.”

“Ok, I learned something new about Stephen I didn’t know.”

“Yeah it’s … whatever,” Miller replied, while Vance offered up a canned chuckle.

If this is the administration’s attempt to humanize Miller, Vance, and the various other Trump cronies who are carrying out this brutal, culturally based anti-immigration campaign, it isn’t working. And it should come as no surprise that someone who looks and acts as cartoonishly evil as Miller has his fries with a side of mayonnaise. That is disgusting.

Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise went on Fox Business to display his wild, willful ignorance regarding “public broadcasting.”

Scalise, who represents Louisiana, helped lead GOP efforts to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which will put hundreds of free, local stations and shows in jeopardy. His response? His constituents should just pay for it.

“Getting rid of the USAID, public broadcasting—look, if you wanna go watch public broadcasting you can pay for it,” Scalise told Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo. “You know, people that wanna watch your show, and a lotta people do, they can pay good advertising dollars because it’s a popular show. If nobody’s watching your program—they’re too many options today in cable programming to have taxpayers funding to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars. We got rid of that wasteful spending, and it’s just the beginning.”

This is not how public broadcasting works, or any publicly funded service for that matter. American citizens already are paying for public broadcasting, and they were receiving worthwhile content in return, from emergency weather alerts to educational content like Ken Burns documentaries and Sesame Street. And even if they weren’t, Scalise’s argument would likely leave mostly poor Americans in rural areas he wants to take public broadcasting from paying even more.

This isn’t about waste, fraud, and abuse. It’s about Republicans and their yearslong war against Corporation for Public Broadcasting–funded institutions like PBS and NPR. For years, the networks have been targeted by conservatives, who frame them as deeply ideological propaganda rather than basic media. Only time will tell how their own constituents will be impacted.

In 1991, Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy for the first time. He is said to have posed as his own publicist in a phone interview. He judged a “Look of the Year” modeling event, whose contestants reportedly included teenage girls as young as 14. His friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was still in bloom.

And the Soviet Union was on its last legs: 1991 was the year it would dissolve. It was also the last year the Russian city now known as St. Petersburg would be called Leningrad.

It was this time to which the president’s mind apparently strayed on Wednesday morning, when he accidentally referred to St. Petersburg by its former name in a social media post.

Trump had taken to Truth Social to disparage the media for covering criticisms of his impending summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The choice to hold the meeting in Alaska had drawn critics, among them Trump’s onetime national security adviser John Bolton, who told CNN: “The only better place for Putin than Alaska would be if the summit were being held in Moscow. So the initial setup, I think, is a great victory for Putin.”

The president reprimanded the press for reporting on this, and for “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people” like Bolton.

“Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin,” Trump said. So unfair, he wrote, that, “if I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!”

It’s unclear what “freeing” those cities would mean, even in the context of this hyperbolic hypothetical.

Anyway, many observers were quick to note the “Leningrad” slip—which, to be sure, was still not as egregious as a gaffe, also regarding the upcoming summit, that the president had made two days earlier, when he incorrectly stated twice that it was taking place in Russia. (If the president’s Wednesday post was a 34-year throwback to 1991, his Monday remarks turned back the clock over a century and a half, to when Alaska was still Russian territory.)

Also in Wednesday morning’s Truth Social post, Trump wrote, “The Fake News is working overtime (No tax on overtime!)”—offering a written example of his (usually verbal) tendency to “weave,” as the 79-year-old president likes to call his free-association-style rambling.

Sudden federal takeovers of America’s cities will apparently be the new normal under the Trump administration.

Several government officials, including one senior administration official, told Rolling Stone Wednesday that it is now a priority to normalize military deployments to cities across the country.

Trump deployed 800 National Guard members to Washington Monday, federalizing the capital’s police department to combat what he described as a crime-riddled hellscape. To justify the government infringement, the country’s most powerful Republican pointed to rising crime rates, immigrant populations, and homelessness—though the figures he used were from 2023, before violent crime plummeted across the nation.

“He’s gonna do more of them,” one Trump administration official told Rolling Stone, referring to wielding the military against the nation’s metropolises. “He promised he would do this and now he’s following through on those promises.”

During a press conference Monday announcing the imminent takeover, Trump warned that several of America’s liberal bastions could experience the same fate.

“We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem. And then, of course, you have Baltimore and Oakland. You don’t even mention them anymore, they’re so far gone,” Trump said, before promising that Washington would be cleaned up “very quick.”

When asked explicitly if other cities were next on his list, Trump said, “We’re just going to see what happens. We’re going to have tremendous success with what we’re doing.

“Other cities are hopefully watching this … and maybe they’ll self-clean up and maybe they’ll self-do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all the things that caused the problem,” he continued.“We’re going to look at New York in a little while. Let’s do this together.”

Other members of the administration quickly picked up on the rhetoric. Speaking with Fox Business on Tuesday, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin claimed that the White House’s efforts to forcibly clean up what she described as a “plague of crime” could be a “blueprint” for more federal takeovers across the country.

Speaking with Fox News that same day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth refused to acknowledge a time limit on Trump’s capital takeover.

The timeline of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump’s friendship is not adding up.

Despite Trump’s doing everything within his power to distance himself from the pedophilic financier, interviews conducted prior to Epstein’s death suggest that the pair were close long after Trump claimed to have thrown Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago for being a “creep.” A new timeline compiled by CNN reveals just how long the two men were entwined.

Their friendship spanned three decades, but in a 2019 interview, Epstein described Trump as his “closest friend for 10 years.” That would have been 15 years after they had a falling out over a bidding war on a Palm Springs oceanfront mansion, and 11 years after Epstein was first convicted on child sex offenses.

Three other individuals who knew the men have also described them as best buds. They include Maria Farmer, a visual artist hired by Epstein who provided the first criminal complaint of sex abuse to law enforcement; Stacey Williams, a model who referred to Trump as Epstein’s “wing man” after the Manhattan real estate mogul allegedly groped her; and Jack O’Donnell, the former president and chief operating officer of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, who recalled scolding Trump in the late 1980s after he arrived at the gambling floor with Epstein and three underage girls.

Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing by law enforcement with regard to the Epstein case, and has insisted that he had “no idea” that Epstein was abusing underage girls.

The White House claimed on July 23 that Trump and Epstein’s relationship ended after Trump kicked Epstein out of his Palm Springs resort for “being a creep.” But days later, Trump offered a different version of events to a crowd of reporters aboard Air Force One, revealing that he knew Epstein “stole” girls in his employ at Mar-a-Lago, and that Virginia Giuffre—one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers—was among them.

His remarks partially corroborated Giuffre’s account of being abducted in 2000 by Epstein’s longtime associate and girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, at Mar-a-Lago, where Giuffre worked at the time as a pool attendant.

The admission shocked Giuffre’s family, who have since questioned what else Trump may have remained tight-lipped about regarding his long friendship with the sex trafficker.

President Trump’s vaguely positive views on marijuana use and legalization have opened up yet another schism within the MAGA movement, as some hard-liners are reverting back to war on drugs–adjacent rhetoric to express their opposition to perhaps the most popular plant in America.

Last Friday it was reported that Trump told donors at an event that he is considering reclassifying marijuana from its current Schedule I level. It was the first time he’d made any real mention of the substance since he was on the campaign trail in September, where he also expressed support for rescheduling. Moving weed away from Schedule I would essentially make it easier to buy, sell, possess, and tax. It’s worth noting that Kim Rivers, CEO of the massive marijuana company Trulieve, was in attendance.

This news quickly sowed trouble on the right, as both the “western civilization is eroding” guys and the more traditional “just say no” crowd shared their grievances with marijuana.

“Our society thrived when everyone was smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey,” wrote Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh, completely ignoring the countless, well-documented, negative impacts (violence and death) of those two American vices. “We became the most powerful nation in the world with liquor and nicotine. No country of potheads has ever thrived, or ever achieved anything at all. Every city that legalized it became an even bigger shithole basically overnight. The entire history of western civilization tells us that marijuana is far, far worse for society.”

Far-right conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec called people smoking weed outside a “huge factor” in violent crime in Washington, D.C. “States with legal weed you can just smell it all over in public,” he continued. “Can’t take kids anywhere.”

“Not that I trust CNN’s reporting, but on the off chance this is true, I’d encourage the White House to nix it,” conservative Daily Wire podcaster Michael Knowles wrote on X. “Liberalizing the law around Haitian oregano gives big Kim Kardashian energy—not the sort of thing people voted for in November!”

Not everyone on the MAGA right shares the same antiquated, Nancy Reagan–level mythmaking around marijuana.

“You know who doesn’t want marijuana moved from Schedule I -> III? Big Pharma— they lose $$ on pain pills & sleeping meds. Big Alcohol—lower revenue. Big Prison—fewer inmates & lower revenue,” wrote Rogan O’Handley, a.k.a. DC Draino, one of the MAGA influencers who got one of those phony “Epstein Files Phase One” binders months ago. “You know who wants it rescheduled? Veterans with PTSD & sleeping issues who don’t want to keep taking pills. Rescheduling marijuana doesn’t legalize it, but it does allow for more medical research.” The weed for veterans angle is very popular within the movement’s pro-rescheduling wing.

This news underscores the evolving politics of marijuana on the right. To some Trump loyalists it’s a symbol of indolence, a sign of trashiness. To others it’s a drug safer than opioids and alcohol that is long overdue for a societal update. Their fearless leader has waffled hard on the issue for years now.

Far-right provocateur Laura Loomer has, in recent weeks, further solidified her status as a de facto personnel director in Trump’s White House. Over a dozen recent firings have been attributable to her pressure campaigns, and the self-described pro–white nationalist even created a tip line to help purge hundreds of supposedly disloyal Trump administration staff.

But her latest target, per Politico Playbook, is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—or, more realistically, Kennedy’s deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, who was formerly the press secretary for Kennedy’s 2024 presidential campaign.

“I’m not naive enough to think that the president is going to get rid of RFK,” Loomer told Politico, but she said “there are concerns about some of the staffing decisions over at [the Department of Health and Human Services].”

She also claimed, citing “sources in HHS,” that “there’s a clear intention by Stefanie Spear to utilize her position to try to lay the groundwork for a 2028 RFK presidential run.” An unnamed Trump administration official told Politico they “would not be surprised” if Kennedy is contemplating such a bid but said it’s not considered “a real threat.”

Politico’s report comes days after Loomer’s successful campaign against top Food and Drug Administration official Vinay Prasad unraveled before her eyes.

Prasad was ousted after Loomer alleged he was a “progressive leftist saboteur” due to his past criticisms of Trump and support for progressive politicians. His return was a victory for RFK Jr., who’d opposed his removal. Loomer called it “egregious” and pledged to ramp up her “exposés of officials within HHS and FDA.”

Loomer has, for months, railed publicly against Kennedy and Spear, as she has against other Trump officials she deems suspect.

In May, she wrote on X that there’s a “vetting crisis” under RFK Jr., pointing to Spear’s past environmental activism and role in founding the environmental news site EcoWatch. Days later, Loomer called Kennedy “Marxist,” and accused him of appointing “full throttled Marxists and Trump haters to work under him at HHS,” such as Spear.

Since then, she’s repeatedly cast aspersions on Kennedy’s deputy chief of staff as a “Marxist” and “National Security Threat.”

Last month, she said Kennedy “is one of the worst Trump Cabinet picks,” and, presaging her claims published in Politico Wednesday, ominously added, “People will fully understand why in 2028.”

The Trump administration appears to be inching away from the responsibility of issuing a monthly jobs report.

Speaking with reporters at a White House press briefing Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt failed to promise that the economic updates would continue, instead downgrading their existence to a “hope” while further undermining the credibility of the data the reports are built upon.

“Will the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to put out monthly jobs reports?” asked a reporter.

“Well, look, what I’ll tell you about the Bureau of Labor Statistics—I believe that is the plan and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust,” Leavitt said. “As you know, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made massive revisions after the last several points reports that they have put out.

“And there has certainly been a decline in the quality and reliability of data coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and there’s been an increase in revisions,” Leavitt continued. “And this president and the administration is finally tackling this problem that so many have talked about. The president is actually doing something about it.”

Donald Trump’s new nominee for BLS commissioner, E.J. Antoni, told Fox Business Tuesday that “BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports” and instead only rely on quarterly data. Prior to entering the fold of the Trump administration, Antoni worked as the Heritage Foundation’s chief economist and helped develop Project 2025.

Trump abruptly fired BLS’s last commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, hours after the release of the last jobs report, claiming that the Biden-era appointee’s work analyzing the granular data of America’s economy was “faked” and could not be trusted.

Revisions to the monthly jobs report are far from out of the ordinary. Instead, it’s fairly normal for the reports to tell a different picture month-to-month, as more data is collected over time from late-submitting survey participants. The report has been published on a monthly basis since 1916, but there hasn’t been an issue with it until Trump 2.0.

At the core of Trump’s gripe with the July report was its revision of figures from the preceding months, which moved the three-month growth average to 35,000. A lag like that hasn’t emerged since 2010, and it made Trump’s first six months in office—and his controversial tariff overhaul—look particularly bad. The report’s downsizing also suggested that while some sectors, such as health care and social assistance, gained jobs, the vast majority of the market lost employment.

The absence of a monthly report would be yet another infringement on transparency and accountability between the federal government and the people it’s supposed to represent.

“We need to look at the means and the methods of how the United States is acquiring this very important data,” Leavitt said Tuesday. “The goal, of course, is to provide honest and good data for the American people to make very important economic decisions on.”

“I don’t have a very good poker face,” Judge Cullen told the department lawyer, Elizabeth Hedges, as she stepped up to the lectern to address him.
Because all 15 federal judges in Maryland were named as defendants, Judge Cullen, who normally sits in Roanoke, Va., was asked to cross state lines to preside over the matter.
In his arguments to Judge Cullen, Mr. Clement said the suit was a fundamental violation of the separation of powers laid out in the U.S. Constitution.
“This is an extraordinary standing order, and so we find ourselves in this position,” she said.","A federal judge signaled on Wednesday that he had doubts about an extraordinary lawsuit the Trump administration filed against the entire federal bench in Maryland, challenging a standing order intended to briefly slow down the government’s ability to deport undocumented immigrants.

During a hearing in Federal District Court in Baltimore, the judge, Thomas T. Cullen, said he had some reservations about the suit, making his remarks even before a lawyer for the Justice Department had the chance to offer any arguments on behalf of the administration.

“I don’t have a very good poker face,” Judge Cullen told the department lawyer, Elizabeth Hedges, as she stepped up to the lectern to address him. “And you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism.”

It was clear from the outset of the hearing just how unusual the case was, which amounted to the administration’s latest attack on the judiciary. Because all 15 federal judges in Maryland were named as defendants, Judge Cullen, who normally sits in Roanoke, Va., was asked to cross state lines to preside over the matter. The judges themselves were excused from being in the courtroom and some in fact were on the bench in other proceedings as the hearing unfolded.

Moreover, the judges managed to get Paul Clement, a former solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases in front of the Supreme Court, to represent them. Out of the gate, Mr. Clement emphasized the bizarre nature of the government’s efforts.

“This is, to state the obvious,” he told Judge Cullen, “not an ordinary lawsuit.”

The administration filed the suit in June, about a month after the chief federal judge in Maryland, George L. Russell III, issued the standing order saying that immigrants who sought to contest their removal from the country by filing what is known as a habeas petition would automatically be granted a two-day reprieve from being expelled by the government.

The order was put in place as a way to give judges time to figure out the complicated legal issues in a flurry of fast-paced cases being filed in Maryland contesting the White House’s aggressive deportation policies. The most prominent was a lawsuit challenging the removal of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was wrongfully returned to his homeland in March.

The suit came during a moment of excruciating tension between the administration and federal judges across the country, who in recent months have issued an avalanche of injunctions against several different parts of President Trump’s policy agenda. But the spectacle of the White House suing an entire district court in the name of the United States of America underscored just how rancorous relations between the two branches had become.

In his arguments to Judge Cullen, Mr. Clement said the suit was a fundamental violation of the separation of powers laid out in the U.S. Constitution. While federal agencies or specific government officials might be able to bring legal claims against the courts, he said, the executive branch as a whole could not do so.

After all, he reasoned, if the government could sue an entire district court, where would it end? Could the White House sue a federal appeals court that issued an order it did not like? Or could it sue the Supreme Court?

What the government should have done, Mr. Clement told Judge Cullen, was either to have challenged the district’s standing order in front of the state judicial council, which acts as an administrative body for the court, or to have appealed it in one of the individual cases in which it was actually imposed.

Mr. Clement also warned of the “nightmare scenarios” that could emerge if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward. He said there would be all kinds of thorny legal problems if, say, White House officials had to be deposed about why they had brought the lawsuit or the judges themselves were made to testify under oath about why they had issued the standing order.

Speaking for the Justice Department, Ms. Hedges sought to play down such concerns. As a preliminary matter, she said that the Trump administration had no plans to sue any other courts, acknowledging that the Maryland suit was something that was not likely to “occur more than once in a generation.”

Still, Ms. Hedges stood behind the administration’s claims that the two-day pause in deportation cases inhibited the White House’s ability to enforce federal immigration law. She also argued that because the order was imposed automatically, it failed to meet the normal legal thresholds needed to impose injunctions on the government.

“This is an extraordinary standing order, and so we find ourselves in this position,” she said.

Judge Cullen told both sides that he intended to hand down a decision in the case by Labor Day, acknowledging that it would most likely be appealed and make its way to higher courts.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/13/us/politics/dc-judges/dc-judges-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:15.978041

28-to-1 votes are lonely.” So far, Murphy isn’t slamming his colleagues for embracing bipartisan negotiations, and his peers aren’t directly criticizing his approach.
Nine days later, Senate Republicans banded together to pass that bill.
“The bills themselves are good, bipartisan bills,” said Murphy.
“And you know,” Murphy continued, “he’s going to use the money in this budget to treat immigrants like animals.”","“Every single day, there’s new evidence that our democracy is falling, and you’ve got to take stands. You have to take fights,” Murphy explained. “I just worry — every time that we go along with these appropriations bills, we’re putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of his campaign to destroy our democracy.”

As the top Democrat on the appropriations panel that funds the Department of Homeland Security, Murphy occupies a role that has historically demanded across-the-aisle collaboration. But in recent weeks, he opposed all spending measures advanced during Senate Appropriations Committee markups for which he was present, challenged his Republican counterpart on the DHS funding bill and voted “no” on the Senate’s first bipartisan funding package of the year.

“I’m nothing if not consistent. I don’t like the position I’m in,” Murphy said. “It’s lonely. 28-to-1 votes are lonely.”

So far, Murphy isn’t slamming his colleagues for embracing bipartisan negotiations, and his peers aren’t directly criticizing his approach. But they aren’t exactly praising him either.

“He has the right to his opinion,” said the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, Patty Murray of Washington. “And I just have the opinion that the more we can do to get bills done, the better chance we have of getting better things for our country.”

Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, one of Murphy’s friends and another senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said Democrats have a duty to at least attempt to strike a cross-party compromise on federal spending ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.

“I’m not his spokesperson,” said Schatz, who is in line to be the chamber’s Democratic whip in the next Congress. “So all I can say is: We’ve been demanding a bipartisan process. So when there’s a step in that direction, I think it’s our obligation to try to be constructive.”

While Murphy has never been a moderate, he has grown rapidly into a liberal firebrand in recent years. Once best known on Capitol Hill for his advocacy for gun control and his foreign policy expertise, he’s now a frequent anti-Trump voice on cable news shows and has waded into controversial social topics like the nation’s “male identity” crisis.

But Murphy’s latest political stand against Trump comes as his name is floated for a bigger-stage battle against Republicans — this time as a presidential contender in 2028.

If the 52-year-old senator seeks the Democratic nomination in three years, his protest of government funding bills could help differentiate him as a candidate who fought the Trump administration with more than just verbal criticism.

“It does fit, right? These are strategies that would make sense if he’s interested in a national platform and to run for office like president,” said Hans Noel, a Georgetown University professor who studies presidential nominations.

“There’s some appeal to a lot of voters — of fighting — especially at the national stage, where he doesn’t have to worry about winning over allies for legislative progress,” Noel continued. “Murphy has been somebody who’s been talking on a national stage for a long time. It’s not completely new. But he’s somebody who’s got that kind of appeal.”

This past week, Murphy spent his birthday at an event with progressives in Arizona, where he talked broadly about the need for Democrats to balance opposition with real policy commitments: “We can’t just be against Donald Trump. We’ve got to give people a vision of something different.”

Since Trump’s election last November, Murphy has grown a beard, announced the end of his 17-year marriage and sparked rumors about romantic ties to a prominent Democratic strategist. In April, he hosted a town hall back in rural North Carolina — more than 500 miles from his blue home state. Then this summer, he launched a PAC aimed at taking on Trump and Republicans in Congress.

Murphy hasn’t always resisted negotiations with Republicans. In 2022, after a gunman left 21 people dead inside a Texas elementary school, he undertook weeks of painstaking talks that resulted in the first significant federal gun-control legislation in two decades. It was the culmination of a nearly decade-long fight for Murphy, who represented Sandy Hook Elementary School in the House at the time of that devastating 2012 shooting.

His next foray into bipartisan talks did not have a happy ending. Last year he scrupulously crafted the high-profile bipartisan border deal with Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, in an attempt to enact Congress’ first major immigration overhaul in more than three decades. Then Trump chilled Republican support for the bill.

To Murphy, it signaled that Republicans couldn’t be trusted to be good-faith actors in negotiations to fund the government: “I think that drama was early proof that they’re never going to cross him,” he said of Republicans’ loyalty to Trump.

This belief was further cemented when Murphy’s GOP colleagues cleared Trump’s $9 billion rescission request last month targeting public broadcasting and foreign aid.

“They can say that they’re going to honor the words on the page,” Murphy said. Yet if Trump “decides to ignore the law,” he continued, “I just don’t think that my Republican colleagues are going to really fight to protect it.”

Democratic leadership’s interest in engaging in bipartisan funding negotiations, from which Murphy is abstaining, is a relatively new development. Just a month ago, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer penned a lengthy “dear colleague” letter insinuating that his members should cut off cross-party talks if Republicans accepted the White House’s rescissions package.

Nine days later, Senate Republicans banded together to pass that bill. And five days after that, Schumer stood with his House counterpart, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, to announce that Democrats still “want to pursue a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations process.”

It has left Murphy as the lone Democratic appropriator continually opposing the funding bills his colleagues are trying to advance, even as he readily admits it’s not the substance of the spending measures he’s against.

“The bills themselves are good, bipartisan bills,” said Murphy. “It’s just — I don’t believe that anything in there is actually going to be implemented.”

This is the case Murphy said he wants to get through to Sen. Katie Britt, the Alabama Republican who chairs the Homeland Security appropriations panel opposite Murphy. The two lawmakers were seen last month in a heated exchange in the well of the Senate floor after passage of the clawback request. Britt described the conversation, captured by C-SPAN cameras, as “a spirited dialogue,” vowing: “I’ll continue to work in good faith, as I always have.”

Murphy, however, said negotiations on the DHS funding bill will be meaningless if Trump and Republicans are going to undermine the spending directives when the measure becomes law. “We had an animated discussion,” Murphy said of his talk with Britt. “Obviously it’s hard to write a bill when the administration is going to stab you in the back as soon as you write it, especially in a space as difficult as immigration and DHS.”

He pointed to specific examples of how Trump has already undermined appropriators, including the president’s efforts to fund the controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center in Florida by diverting money Congress appropriated for “humane” alternatives to detainment.

“And you know,” Murphy continued, “he’s going to use the money in this budget to treat immigrants like animals.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F32%2F7c%2F0b7affef43898bd342f60d0c3c96%2Fu-s-congress-36768.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 20:56:21.511241

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, a Donald Trump appointee from the Western District of Virginia who was assigned to the case by the Fourth Circuit, took the bench at Baltimore federal court amid an unprecedented suit against his colleagues.

The Justice Department filed the suit on June 24, naming all 15 federal judges on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland as defendants, to challenge Chief U.S. District Judge George Russell III’s block on any active removal efforts tied to a habeas petition for 48 business hours.

Paul Clement, of Clement Murphy and representing the judges, maintained that the injunctions provide a chance for judges to consider the petition before an immigrant is removed — as was the case for Kilmar Abrego Garcia — but the Justice Department argued the so-called “automatic injunctions” are an unlawful overreach of judicial authority.

Clement argued if Cullen adopted the Justice Department’s positions, it could open the door for similar suits against circuit courts, like the Fourth Circuit, further upending the ""judicial order.""

Cullen pushed the theory even further, saying the executive branch could even sue the Supreme Court.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Hedges defended the decision to bring the suit in Maryland, describing Russell's order as the unprecedented action rather than its suit, and denounced concerns that any “floodgates” would open for suits against circuit courts and the Supreme Court.

In its briefs, the Justice Department cited two cases — Stern v. U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and Whitehouse v. U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — as examples providing a roadmap for the administration’s challenge against the Maryland bench and Russell’s standing order.

Cullen acknowledged that the suits were able to avoid judicial immunity, but added that the case’s titles were “considerably more modest” when compared to this case, titled United States of America v. Russell.

“This is taking it up about six notches,” Cullen said.

Cullen pressed Hedges why the administration does not bring an interlocutory appeal challenging the application of a standing order in an individual immigration case to the Fourth Circuit, as per the usual procedure.

Hedges argued that the administration would face certain challenges bringing such appeals, and the time spent litigating each individual case in court was an undue burden on the government.

Cullen replied that the administration has been able to seek swift relief from appellate courts and the Supreme Court by bringing previously rare appeals for temporary restraining orders, like in J.G.G v. Trump.

On the merits, Hedges slammed the standing order as clearly violating the clear requirements needed for granting preliminary relief, particularly an assessment of any irreparable harm that would otherwise occur without relief.

Clement rejected that assertion, arguing that the standing order maintained the status quo and effectively provided an administrative stay. In practice, a temporary pause “doesn’t make a material difference,” as judges can still deny a habeas petition upon taking up the case.

The judges have maintained that the suit should be dismissed as Trump has failed to show why sovereign immunity or judicial immunity should not apply in the case.

In a Monday filing, the judges slammed the lawsuit as “not just novel, but deeply flawed,” noting that if the administration could clear the immunity hurdle, it would still fail on the merits.

“Every court has the inherent authority to issue administrative orders to ensure that it can do its job,” the judges wrote. “The exercise of that inherent authority here — a modest, two-business-day hold to allow the court to open a case and assess its jurisdiction — is eminently reasonable, entirely lawful, and far less of an imposition on the executive than comparable appellate-court stays.”

The suit has raised separation-of-power concerns among court observers amid the administration’s campaign to seemingly punish federal judges it views as obstructing its far-right agenda, in particular its mass deportation efforts. One of the named defendants, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, presided over Abrego Garcia’s case and has drawn particular ire from the administration.

Last month, the Justice Department filed a misconduct complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington after he expressed concern that the Trump administration would not comply with court orders at a closed-door session of the Judicial Conference in March.

Cullen indicated he would issue a ruling before Labor Day on Sept. 1.

A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can slash up to roughly $2 billion in foreign aid payments that it halted earlier this year, delivering a victory to the Trump administration months after President Donald Trump sought to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled 2-1 to vacate a lower court’s preliminary injunction handed down earlier this year. The lower court judge had required the Trump administration to resume its payments on nearly $1.98 billion in owed funds for USAID projects previously approved by Congress, after the Trump administration abruptly froze them earlier this year. The issue has been held up in federal court for months.

Writing for the majority, Judge Karen L. Henderson, a President George H.W. Bush appointee, said that the plaintiffs lacked the proper cause of action to sue the Trump administration over its decision to withhold the funds, or what is known as impoundment.

SCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS

The plaintiffs, Henderson said, ""may not bring a freestanding constitutional claim if the underlying alleged violation and claimed authority are statutory.""

""Nor do the grantees have a cause of action under the APA because APA review is precluded by the Impoundment Control Act (ICA),"" she added, though she noted the U.S. Comptroller General could technically sue under that law.

The 2-1 majority also ruled that the plaintiffs failed to show Trump had acted ""plainly"" in excess of his executive branch authorities.

Judge Henderson was joined in the majority opinion by Judge Greg Katsas, a Trump appointee.

It was not immediately clear whether the plaintiffs in the case would seek to have their case reviewed en banc— or by the full panel for the Democrat-majority U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C.— though doing so could afford them some near-term relief, if the full appeals court sided with the federal judge who had issued the preliminary injunction earlier this year.

Regardless, the ruling is a major victory for President Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on his first day in office in January to block nearly all foreign aid spending as part of his administration’s broader crackdown on waste, fraud, and abuse.

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO PAY 'UNLAWFULLY' RESTRICTED USAID FUNDS

Critics, meanwhile, have argued that the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. investment and presence around the world risks economic harm, reputational damage and new security risks at home and abroad.

Trump’s executive order sparked a flurry of federal lawsuits, and eventually made its way to the Supreme Court in February. Justices on the high court denied the Trump administration’s request in February to continue its freeze on USAID payments, ruling 5-4 that an earlier Feb. 26 payment deadline had already expired, and remanded the case back to the district court to clarify additional payment details.

Four conservative justices on the bench excoriated the slim majority ruling earlier this year.

Justice Samuel Alito issued a scathing, eight-page dissent in February blasting the narrow court majority's ruling as an ""unfortunate misstep,"" and one he argued ""rewards an act of judicial hubris"" by the lower court judge, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali.

LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS

""Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise,"" Alito wrote in the dissent, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

""I am stunned,"" he added.

TRUMP TEMPORARILY THWARTED IN DOGE MISSION TO END USAID

Still, the Trump administration's efforts have sparked the ire of foreign aid groups and other recipients of the assistance, who argue that the quick dismantling of them risked ""immediate and irreparable harm.""

They have also raised concerns that slashing the funds could create new obstacles for U.S. businesses looking to open or expand into foreign markets.

Scott Greytak, a director at the group U.S. Transparency International, previously told Fox News Digital in a statement that cutting such a large amount of U.S. foreign aid carries significant economic and security risks— especially in countries with higher risks of corruption, could ""open the door for increased cross-border corruption, fraud, and other crimes,"" he said.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/donald-trump-fist-pump-copy.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:20.168461

The judge also barred the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from sharing Medicaid data with DHS, saying that Washington and the multistate coalition were likely to succeed on their claim that the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action.

The preliminary injunction will remain in place either until after HHS and DHS complete a reasoned decision-making process that complies with the Administrative Procedure Act, or until litigation concludes.

“Protecting people’s private health information is vitally important,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “And everyone should be able to seek medical care without fear of what the federal government may do with that information.”

On July 1, Washington joined a multistate coalition led by California to sue the Trump administration, arguing that the mass transfer of Medicaid data violates the law and asking the court to block any new transfer or use of this data for immigration enforcement purposes. The lawsuit highlighted that the administration’s illegal actions are creating fear and confusion, leading eligible noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid. This leaves states and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency health care services.

Washington’s Medicaid program is operated as a part of the broader Apple Health suite of health benefits programs. Washington residents signed up for Apple Health understanding that their information would be confidential and not shared for reasons unrelated to the provision of health care.

Apple Health includes Apple Health Expansion, which provides full-scope medical services to Washington residents regardless of their immigration status. There are more than 1.9 million Apple Health clients in Washington, including about 49,000 whose immigration status makes them ineligible for some federally funded programs. Apple Health covers a range of health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, primary and preventative care, long-term services and supports, and behavioral health.

Brown joined the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont in filing the lawsuit.

Does that combination basically negate the sanctuary city status in Washington, D.C.?
“I think D.C. under federal control is not going to be a sanctuary city.
But Washington isn’t the only sanctuary city in the hot seat.
In the event that President Trump actually wants to help local law enforcement, Hodges offered some advice.","The Trump administration and the aviation companies working for it have been purposely hiding the tail numbers on immigration flights to avoid public scrutiny and accountability, CNN reports. This move comes as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown ratchets up in frequency and aggression, as deportation flights are up 15 percent from last year.

A plane removing a tail number is the equivalent of a car removing a license plate. With the tail number, civilians, journalists, and immigration organizations alike can keep an eye on which deportation flights are leaving, and to where. It also helps loved ones track their deported family members.

The flights are run by multiple private charter companies and at least one commercial airline, each of which have lucrative contracts with ICE.

Flightradar24, one of the websites that covers immigration, noticed in March that those subcontractors requested that their tail numbers be hidden from public flight-tracking sites and records, making them extremely difficult to follow. The bulk of these flights are domestic, moving detainees from facility to facility.

“Flights operated on behalf of the United States government are often unidentified at the government’s request. As subcontractors to the United States government, we ask that you direct your questions to them,” said a spokesperson from Avelo Airlines, a company that has dedicated three of its planes to ICE deportations.

“This is vital information to be able to understand how ICE is conducting its enforcement and deportation activities,” ACLU National Prison Project senior counsel Eunice Cho told CNN. “Sometimes this is the only information that the public has with respect to where ICE is placing people because of a general lack of transparency around detention and deportation under this particular administration.”

The Department of Homeland Security has yet to comment.

“Does the fact that there’s National Guard now there—it’s a sanctuary city, like sanctuary cities across the country—but it’s unique in that it has federal control, and now you have the National Guard on the ground side by side with ICE. Does that combination basically negate the sanctuary city status in Washington, D.C.? At least for these 30 days, in terms of what you can do there, Tom?” asked host Martha MacCallum.

“Yes,” Homan said, plainly. “I think D.C. under federal control is not going to be a sanctuary city.

“We’re working with the police hand in hand, and when we encounter a criminal illegal alien, they will be turned over to ICE,” the former acting director of ICE continued. “And that’s the way it should be.

“I’m not saying every illegal alien in D.C. is a criminal. But many are,” Homan said. “There is no sanctuary for these people in the city of D.C.”

Washington’s City Council unanimously approved the Sanctuary Values Amendment Act in 2019, and Mayor Muriel Bowser signed the act into law that same year. But Bowser has worked to undo that legacy since Trump returned to the White House, attempting to repeal Washington’s sanctuary status law in a 300-page budget bill. In June, the D.C. City Council erased the language in the budget that would have killed the sanctuary law in the board’s effort to retain the designation.

But Washington isn’t the only sanctuary city in the hot seat. In late May, the Department of Homeland Security released a list of some 35 regions, including 13 states, that it considered to be “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The states included California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, in addition to the nation’s capital.

President Trump’s federal takeover of D.C. “doesn’t make a lot of sense” to D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, he told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing on Wednesday. The interview highlights how the ongoing militarization of the nation’s capital is not only an authoritarian power grab but also a theatrical farce.

Hodges—who was attacked while defending the Capitol building on January 6, 2021—noted that the troops Trump has stationed in D.C. are not exactly cut out for the job.

The National Guardsmen patrolling the city’s streets are not “in their lane,” said Hodges, citing his six-year stint as a member of the Virginia National Guard. “I can tell you that this is not what they’re trained to do,” Hodges said. “Soldiers are trained to fight and win wars. We’re not in a war out here in D.C. There’s crime out here, but it’s not a war-torn hellscape like Trump has said. The troops are not trained to do law enforcement.”

As for the officers from various federal agencies now policing Washington, he said, “I don’t think this is really their specialization either. So many of these federal officers are investigators. They’re supposed to be behind a desk, you know, working that way.” Rather than helping local police in the harsher areas of the city, Hodges said, “you’re going to see [the federal agents] standing around in Chinatown or on the [National] Mall or walking around Georgetown.” (Social media footage from the first few days of Trump’s takeover shows them doing just that.)

In the event that President Trump actually wants to help local law enforcement, Hodges offered some advice. For one, he said, the president could “actually allow D.C. to spend its own money.” D.C., after all, is currently still “in the hole” by about $1 billion due to Republican cuts to the city’s budget. Further, Hodges suggested, the Federal Emergency Management Agency could undo its recent 44 percent cut in assistance to the city’s security funding.

“So there are things that they can do to help us out that they’re not doing, and I would love to know why,” he said.

There’s apparently much more of the nonsense Hodges describes to come. Trump on Wednesday announced plans to extend the D.C. occupation beyond 30 days, at which point—though he will require congressional approval under the Home Rule Act—he’s vowed to do so even without Congress’s green light. And the capital is apparently just a testing ground, as the president suggests he’ll bring similar crackdowns to cities across the country.

President Trump was accidentally caught in one of his favorite lies: that he finished the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, one of the marquee promises of his first term.

“The Biden administration was auctioning off border wall materials, but we’re hearing now that … the auctioneer’s selling those materials back,” a reporter asked Trump while he took questions Wednesday at the Kennedy Center. “Are you finishing building the wall?”

“Well, I’ve built hundreds of miles of wall, and I was getting very close. I actually finished the wall, but then I added another 200 miles because when you do the original wall that I said I was gonna build—which I got built—and I got it to the specifications of the Border Patrol and ICE,” the president answered meanderingly. “They wanted steel, they wanted concrete inside, they wanted rebar inside that, they wanted it to have wires, the walls are wired for, you know, all of the internet stuff and security things.”

The president’s answer doesn’t make much sense. He said verbatim that he finished building the wall, but added on an extra 200 miles for the hell of it. How do you add 200 miles to a finished border wall without altering the border itself, which Trump never achieved?

He’s lying to avoid admitting that he failed at something. In reality, Trump only added 500 miles of border wall to a 2,000-mile border, and most of those wall pieces were for repair or reinforcement. And it wasn’t even a wall—it was a 30-foot fence.

“There’s new reporting that the Russians have hacked into computer systems that manage U.S. federal court documents. I wonder if you’ve seen this report, and do you plan to bring it up with Putin when you see him later in the week?” asked one reporter.

“I guess I could. Are you surprised? Are you surprised? They hack in, that’s what they do,” Trump said. “They’re good at it, we’re good at it, we’re actually better at it.”

The New York Times reported Tuesday that a Russian entity had accessed the court case document system, as well as “recently compromised sealed records,” as part of a yearslong effort.

“Some of the searches included mid-level criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,” the Times reported.

But the president’s shocking reaction to the attack also undercuts Republican efforts to reframe the 2016 Trump-Russia scandal against Clinton and former President Barack Obama: If he doesn’t care about Russian meddling under the nose of his administration, why would he care so deeply about reframing the narrative around the foreign power’s intervention nine years ago?

Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday in Alaska to discuss a potential resolution to the war in Ukraine. It will be the first time that the Russian leader has stepped foot on U.S. soil in over a decade.

But more than 200 pages of Loomer’s transcribed deposition in her defamation lawsuit against Maher shed light on the influencer’s beliefs and prerogatives—and illustrate her as a raving conspiracist rather than a fine-tuned firing machine.

In sprawling answers to completely unrelated questions, Loomer rants about George Stephanopolous, her lack of boyfriends, and her inability to get a White House press credential, in an interview that quickly flies off the handle.

In one particularly wild exchange, Loomer practically roasted Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene as someone who puts “roast beef in her pants.”

“Because I know she likes to eat at Arby’s,” Loomer said, further clarifying that she believes Greene puts the meat sandwiches in her pants and that she believed Greene would agree with that statement.

“Are you making a derogatory comment about her sex life by talking about Arby’s in her pants?” the counsel asked.

“No. I’m talking about Arby’s, the sandwiches. I’m talking about Arby’s. I would—I’m a very direct person,” Loomer said. “If I was making a derogatory comment, I would have said it.”

Three days into his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., Trump said he plans to extend the crackdown beyond its month-long limit—with or without congressional approval.

The president on Wednesday was asked if he considers the 30-day timeframe during which he’s allowed, under the Home Rule Act, to control D.C.’s police before needing Congress’s OK as sufficient to address his imagined crime spike.

Before today, his administration’s answer to this question was seemingly yes; a White House official has said the operation is “expected to last 30 days.”

Now Trump is looking to extend it.

The president indicated Wednesday that his plan A is to put a “crime bill” before Congress “very quickly.” The bill, he said, will “pertain, initially, to D.C.” and ask “for extensions on that—long-term extensions, because you can’t have 30 days.” Trump noted that he expects unanimous Republican support for this (though, as Semafor reports, Senate Democrats seem able and committed to block an extension).

But Trump also expressed his willingness to bypass Congress to draw out the takeover. “Well, if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress,” he said, adding that while he expects all Republicans to fall in line, “if I have to [call a national emergency], I will.”

Trump has flogged national emergency power more than any other recent president, exhibiting, per libertarian legal scholar Ilya Somin, “a dangerous pattern of invoking spurious emergencies to undermine the Constitution, threatening liberty and circumventing Congress.” So far during his second term, he’s declared a dozen such national emergencies—and is apparently ready to add to that list in order to impose his will, unchecked, on the American people.

If this is the administration’s attempt to humanize Miller, Vance, and the various other Trump cronies who are carrying out this brutal, culturally based anti-immigration campaign, it isn’t working. And it should come as no surprise that someone who looks and acts as cartoonishly evil as Miller has his fries with a side of mayonnaise. That is disgusting.

“Getting rid of the USAID, public broadcasting—look, if you wanna go watch public broadcasting you can pay for it,” Scalise told Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo. “You know, people that wanna watch your show, and a lotta people do, they can pay good advertising dollars because it’s a popular show. If nobody’s watching your program—they’re too many options today in cable programming to have taxpayers funding to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars. We got rid of that wasteful spending, and it’s just the beginning.”

This is not how public broadcasting works, or any publicly funded service for that matter. American citizens already are paying for public broadcasting, and they were receiving worthwhile content in return, from emergency weather alerts to educational content like Ken Burns documentaries and Sesame Street. And even if they weren’t, Scalise’s argument would likely leave mostly poor Americans in rural areas he wants to take public broadcasting from paying even more.

This isn’t about waste, fraud, and abuse. It’s about Republicans and their yearslong war against Corporation for Public Broadcasting–funded institutions like PBS and NPR. For years, the networks have been targeted by conservatives, who frame them as deeply ideological propaganda rather than basic media. Only time will tell how their own constituents will be impacted.

In 1991, Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy for the first time. He is said to have posed as his own publicist in a phone interview. He judged a “Look of the Year” modeling event, whose contestants reportedly included teenage girls as young as 14. His friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was still in bloom.

And the Soviet Union was on its last legs: 1991 was the year it would dissolve. It was also the last year the Russian city now known as St. Petersburg would be called Leningrad.

It was this time to which the president’s mind apparently strayed on Wednesday morning, when he accidentally referred to St. Petersburg by its former name in a social media post.

Trump had taken to Truth Social to disparage the media for covering criticisms of his impending summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The choice to hold the meeting in Alaska had drawn critics, among them Trump’s onetime national security adviser John Bolton, who told CNN: “The only better place for Putin than Alaska would be if the summit were being held in Moscow. So the initial setup, I think, is a great victory for Putin.”

The president reprimanded the press for reporting on this, and for “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people” like Bolton.

“Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin,” Trump said. So unfair, he wrote, that, “if I got Moscow and Leningrad free, as part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!”

It’s unclear what “freeing” those cities would mean, even in the context of this hyperbolic hypothetical.

Anyway, many observers were quick to note the “Leningrad” slip—which, to be sure, was still not as egregious as a gaffe, also regarding the upcoming summit, that the president had made two days earlier, when he incorrectly stated twice that it was taking place in Russia. (If the president’s Wednesday post was a 34-year throwback to 1991, his Monday remarks turned back the clock over a century and a half, to when Alaska was still Russian territory.)",https://images.newrepublic.com/33ad946d63ced978b7bc5e73e43aa9a74450b789.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-08-13 21:57:26.974859

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained at least six people in Oakland on Tuesday, Aug. 12, at a home on 79th Avenue near Hillside Street. Among the detainees are a 17-year-old and someone with a severe disability, according to Nikolas De Bremaeker, immigrants’ rights managing attorney at Centro Legal.

De Bremaeker said he met with the detainees Tuesday after a call was received through the Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline (ACILEP).

“I pressed with ICE the illegality of detention of a child under these circumstances, and they will either release or move to a child detention center tonight,” De Bremaeker told The Oaklandside in an email.

The detainees are being held at the San Francisco ICE Field Office, according to De Bremaeker.

“A child is supposed to be held in a facility appropriate for children with certain requirements, as dictated by the Flores Settlement,” he said, referring to a 1997 settlement that establishes rules and regulations for the treatment of children in U.S. federal custody.

Centro Legal is one of the organizations working with ACILEP, a county program launched in February in response to the Trump Administration’s targeted immigration enforcement. ACILEP connects people with legal aid and helps verify reported ICE sightings in Alameda County.

In June, the Oakland Police Department confirmed to The Oaklandside that ICE agents have conducted targeted enforcement in the city for specific individuals, but didn’t provide further information.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the arrests prior to publication.

This is the first confirmed ICE sighting in Oakland that came through the hotline, according to Centro Legal’s program manager, Angel Ibarra.

“It was thanks to the calls we received from the community and family that we were able to verify the activity and connect them with Niko [De Bremaeker] for legal support,” said Ibarra via email.

California is the state with the largest population of people residing in the U.S. without legal authorization, with estimates ranging from 2.3 million to 2.6 million according to the American Immigration Council and the Pew Research Center. Texas and Florida have the second and third largest populations, at 2.1 million and 1.2 million respectively. In the first five months of the second Trump administration, Texas accounted for 26,341 ICE arrests, roughly a quarter of the total nationwide for that period, while Florida logged 12,982 arrests, and there were 8,460 in California, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of data obtained from the UC Berkeley-based Deportation Data Project. In terms of ICE arrests per one million residents, California ranked 27th in the nation, according to the LA Times analysis.

According to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis of the records obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE arrests in the San Francisco “area of responsibility” (which includes Kern County and north in California in addition to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam) increased 70% in the first months of President Donald Trump’s second term when compared to final six months of the Biden administration, for a total of 1,730 arrests. In December 2024, approximately 10% of the people ICE arrested in the San Francisco area of responsibility had no criminal convictions. The proportion has been steadily increasing in 2025, according to the SF Chronicle analysis, with 40% of ICE arrests in May in the area involving people with no criminal conviction.

De Bremaeker reminded community members of their constitutional rights under the 4th and 5th Amendments.

“It is unclear why this home raid happened, but a resident opened the door. I want to remind all to use your constitutional right to remain silent. Do not open your door,” De Bremaeker said. “ICE can’t come into your home unless they have a signed court/judge warrant or you let them in.”

Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license.","This article was produced in partnership with Gulf States Newsroom.

Alexander Sanchez had only been in the United States for two months when police officers pulled him over one morning in December near a major intersection in Kenner, about 10 miles outside of New Orleans.

It was a routine stop — the Kenner Police officers who pulled him over said Sanchez had run a red light — but it ended with Sanchez in a federal immigration detention center.

According to the police report, when an officer asked Sanchez for his driver’s license and his car’s registration and insurance information, Sanchez – who was undocumented and could not obtain a driver’s license in Louisiana – handed him a Honduran passport.

Speaking through an interpreter in a phone interview in June, Sanchez said he told the officer, “No tengo permitido” — I’m not permitted.

Sanchez was booked into the Kenner jail for driving without a license and the traffic signal violation. He said he spent three days in jail and then he was taken to federal immigration detention in rural Louisiana.

Hours after his arrest, Kenner, officers filled out a second arrest report for Sanchez based on a procedural request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — called an immigration detainer. Detainers are used to request that local law enforcement either let ICE know when they’re going to release detainees who may be subject to deportation or to hold them for 48 hours beyond when they would otherwise be released to facilitate their transfer to immigration detention.

Sanchez would be held for months inside a notorious former state prison in Winnfield — now used for immigration detainees — with a history of alleged human rights abuses. (Sanchez is no longer in immigration detention, he asked that his current location not be disclosed. He is identified by his middle name and second last name for the same reason.)

Sanchez’ case is hardly unique in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans with a large Hispanic population.

Gulf States Newsroom and Verite News analyzed Kenner Police Department arrest records for the first five months of this year and found that traffic arrests from stops and crashes in that city are serving as a gateway to immigration detention — and possible deportation — for many.

President Donald Trump came into office this year promising a nationwide crackdown undocumented immigrants. Among the tools his administration has used more extensively are detainer requests, which were up more than 60 percent in the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to federal data reported by the Deportation Data Project.

But in Kenner, the increase has been even more dramatic. ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the 20 detainers issued through Kenner PD during the same period in 2024.

The vast majority of people booked on immigration detainers after being arrested by Kenner police from January through May were born in Honduras, according to the data shared by the Deportation Data Project.

According to Kenner arrest records, at least 75 of them, more than half, were initially booked for traffic-related offenses following a stop or collision.

The most common traffic offense linked to an immigration detainer was driving without a license — under state law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Louisiana licenses — often accompanied by other traffic-related charges.

More than half of the people whom Kenner PD arrested for unlicensed driving between January and May 2025 became subjects of immigration detainer requests, like the one issued for Sanchez.

Asked for comment on Sanchez’s case, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “defers to KPD.”

Rachel Taber, a member of New Orleans-based immigrants rights group Union Migranté, said she has been consulting with people whose loved ones have ended up detained and in some cases deported after traffic stops in Kenner. She stressed that the arrests can traumatize families who may be separated over a traffic offense.

“The penalty doesn’t fit the crime,” Taber said. “A minor traffic infraction does not merit … never being able to hug your kids again.”

As of Tuesday (Aug. 12) it was not clear how many of the people for whom detainers were issued had more serious criminal records. (Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom have requested all criminal background check information obtained by Kenner law enforcement.)

ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the same period in 2024.

As more local departments, encouraged by Trump, are partnering with ICE, similar patterns are emerging throughout the country. In June, The Washington Post reported on how expanding partnerships between ICE and police agencies around the country have deployed traffic arrests as part of the machinery of immigration enforcement.

Though Louisiana law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE in the past, no such formal partnerships were in place at the beginning of this year, when Trump took office. This year, however, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and his conservative allies in the state legislature have strongly pushed for their adoption. And in March, Kenner PD became one of the first Louisiana departments to ink a new agreement with the federal agency, although as of last month, that program had not been fully implemented, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in an interview.

To Conley, ICE’s increased reliance on local law enforcement, and its use of detainers, shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the emphasis on local-federal partnerships from both Trump and Landry, who has pushed local agencies in Louisiana to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.

“I think it was the perfect storm, with a governor coming in that’s very law-and-order, and then you have the president coming in that ran on immigration reform and border security. So I don’t think it’s a coincidence now that we had these spikes,” he said.

Conley said traffic enforcement is the “number one” concern for Kenner constituents. Driving without a license is a particular concern because of the risk that unlicensed and uninsured drivers may cause an accident, and the other drivers involved may “never get made whole,” Conley said.

Michele Waslin, assistant director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said that scenario is why some states have expanded eligibility for driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.

“Obviously, people are driving without licenses. You’re not stopping them from driving,” Waslin said. “We want them to be licensed and insured … so in the case that there is an accident, what you described won’t happen.”

Waslin, who has studied the intersection of driver’s license policy and immigration enforcement, said laws blocking undocumented immigrants from accessing licenses “very clearly intersect with agreements with state and local police to identify people for deportation.”

Conley said his agency is not enforcing immigration law, but making arrests based on criminal laws.

“They’re in our lockup based on a lawful criminal arrest. If [Homeland Security Investigations] calls and puts a detainer on them, I’m going to honor the detainer,” Conley said, referring to a branch of ICE that investigates immigration violations.

‘You’re going to get brought to jail’

Sanchez fled Honduras after receiving death threats, according to his immigration attorney, Jeremy Jong. In October, he settled in the New Orleans metro area, near his aunt, Judith Cruz.

On the morning Sanchez was arrested, he was driving to Cruz’s house in St. Rose, which borders Kenner, to take her to church, Cruz said in an interview.

Sanchez couldn’t get a driver’s license because Louisiana requires applicants for driver’s licenses to show proof that they are in the country legally.

Driving without a license is considered a misdemeanor in Louisiana. According to a Kenner city ordinance, the penalty for driving without a license is up to $500 in fines and no more than 60 days behind bars, The state penalty is more stringent , with possible fines and a maximum of six months behind bars.

Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license. In Kenner, however, it’s required. For undocumented immigrants like Sanchez, an arrest can lead to an ICE detainer request, then a lengthy stay in immigration detention and possible deportation.

Conley said police in Kenner have long been required to arrest anyone suspected of driving without a license. In an interview in May, the police chief said his department has been “transparent” about its policy.

“Here in the city of Kenner, it’s very well known that if you’re operating a vehicle and you’ve never been issued a license, you’re going to get brought to jail,” he said.

Kenner PD is a potential outlier. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom asked 10 law enforcement agencies in the region, including the Louisiana State Police, about their policies and practices for encounters with unlicensed drivers. Of the seven that responded, only one other agency – St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office – has a mandatory arrest policy on suspicion of driving without a license.

Through a translator, Cruz said she knows many immigrants in her community who have been arrested by Kenner Police and booked into the city’s local jail for traffic violations. She said some of them, like her nephew, ended up in the hands of immigration agents.

She said mothers who need to provide for their children and cannot always get a ride will take the risk of driving without a license in order to get to and from work.

“Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you’re taking your life in your hands,” Cruz said. “It’s just very painful to think about all the children that could be left home without their families.”

There are two main ways that ICE learns of people in local jails who may have violated federal immigration law. When someone is booked into jail, that person’s information is often electronically shared with multiple federal agencies, according to Lindsay Williams, a public information officer for ICE.

If agents at ICE find the person is suspected of immigration violations, they’ll contact the ICE office responsible for the region where the arrest was made, and that office will issue a detainer, Williams said. Local or state agencies can also inform ICE agents in their area about people in custody. Williams said officials in the New Orleans ICE office learn about arrests by Kenner PD through both methods.

The records obtained by the newsrooms do not shed light on why authorities requested an immigration detainer for each individual in Kenner.

A boom in federal-local immigration enforcement partnerships under Trump

The jump in detainers issued to Kenner PD aligns with a national increase in ICE’s use of these requests that may be attributed to pressure from the Trump administration to ramp up immigration arrests in order to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations.

In the early days of his second term Trump urged homeland security officials to secure more agreements with local agencies to collaborate on immigration enforcement. These partnerships – called 287(g) agreements – deputize local officials to perform some ICE duties.

“If you want to increase the number of deportations, if you want large numbers, then you’re going to use these partnerships more and more,” Waslin said.

In Louisiana, Landry, an immigration hardliner and Trump ally, began laying the groundwork for increased state and local participation in immigration enforcement in 2024. During that year’s legislative session, Landry worked with Republican lawmakers on a civil law that prohibits law enforcement agencies from following so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation with ICE. This June, Landry signed a new piece of legislation with sharper teeth into law, making it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for local officials to refuse to comply with immigration detainer requests.

As of mid-August, ICE has 897 active partnerships with agencies around the country for the 287(g) program, according to the agency – compared to 135 in December near the end of the Biden Administration. In Louisiana, which had no participants enrolled in the program at the end of last year, 17 agencies, including Kenner PD, have signed up.

While the department is not yet fully accredited in the program, Williams, the ICE representative, said Kenner PD’s existing relationship with the agency was a “main contributing factor” to securing the partnership.

“The relationship is a stellar example of state and local cooperation with ICE for upholding public safety and has been for many years across multiple presidential administrations,” Williams said in an email.

Once accredited, Kenner PD will operate under what is called a “jail enforcement model,” which authorizes police officers to investigate immigration statuses of people booked into the city’s jail, place them into immigration proceedings and issue immigration detainers themselves.

‘A failure to yield upended her life’

In some cases in Kenner, people were involved in traffic crashes other people had a hand in — only to be arrested and later booked by immigration agents, Kenner PD records show.

In an incident on March 7, a woman spoke to police as the victim of an alleged hit-and-run, according to a probable cause statement in arrest reports.

Police arrested her for driving without a license, and she was booked on an ICE detainer the next day. Conley said people involved in an accident will be asked if they have a driver’s license and will “be held to the law.”

In Kenner, records do show arrests of some people who were accused of crimes with serious penalties and then booked on immigration detainers. For example, between January and May, 2025, Kenner police took at least three people into custody who were suspected of sex-related crimes and then booked on detainers.

Nationally, the share of people arrested by immigration officers who also have past criminal convictions has fallen when compared to the previous presidential administration, one recent analysis showed.

Jong, an attorney at immigrants rights organization Al Otro Lado, said he’s had a few clients who have been detained after being arrested for traffic offenses in Kenner.

He still thinks about a client, a woman from El Salvador, who was arrested by Kenner police officers for allegedly failing to obey a traffic sign back in 2017. Jong said the woman’s family was “ruined” by her deportation.

“A failure to yield upended her life and split up this family,” Jong said. “Her husband was torn up.”

Jong said knowing the possible consequences for arrests of immigrants in Kenner, he doesn’t understand the department’s policy of arresting people who are unable to obtain driver’s licenses in the state for not having them.

“There’s so much discretion for a police department to determine what laws you’re gonna put people in jail for,” Jong said. “It does seem like they are making the conscious decision to do something that is gonna lead to many of their residents getting deported.”

In an email, Conley said the responsibility lies with the individual who isn’t licensed, and that Kenner is “diverse and inclusive.”

Sanchez was detained for five months at Winn Correctional Center. He said near the end of his time there, he experienced headaches daily and became paranoid – fearful of the danger he said he escaped in Honduras.

He said he thinks fondly about his time in Louisiana before he was arrested because he felt safe.

“Things were going pretty well for me,” he said. “I wasn’t in danger.”

He said he tries not to think about his time in immigration detention.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84debb5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F24%2F871f4ab14d4aa1043c3d34f2cea7%2F20250811-czb-kenner-02-2000x1334.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:48.750762

ICE recruitment efforts have also targeted active local law enforcement officers.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Tuesday that the agency has received over 100,000 applications in less than two weeks. The statement was released only a day after The New York Times reported that immigrant detainees in ICE custody had reached a ""modern record"" high of 60,000 people.

President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) on July 4, which appropriated nearly $75 billion to increase ICE's capacity to detain immigrants and conduct immigration-related arrests—making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country. With this funding, the Trump administration plans to reach its stated goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants a year and reach an unprecedented quota of 3,000 immigrant arrests per day.

To keep up with these demands, ICE has launched an aggressive recruitment campaign—bankrolled by the nearly $30 billion from the OBBBA appropriated for hiring—and seeks to add 10,000 officers to the agency's more than 20,000 law enforcement and support personnel by 2029. To meet this end, Uncle Sam has been repurposed by ICE to recruit ""patriotic Americans"" to apply. The agency has also sweetened the deal by offering high starting salaries—some can reach $90,000—a maximum $50,000 signing bonus over three years, up to $60,000 in federal student loan repayments, and retirement benefits.

Last week, the agency also announced it was ending the age limitations for applicants—previously set between 21 and 37 or 40 years old, depending on the position—and began reaching out to retired federal law enforcement agents. The ICE recruitment website has a specific page dedicated to those who wish to ""return to mission,"" encouraging retirees to apply for ICE openings and ""secure our communities and uphold our laws"" during a ""pivotal moment in our country's history."" Selected retired federal law enforcement officers may also receive a salary from ICE while still collecting their pension.

Some speculate that the change to age limits and other policies means that ICE is having a hard time finding qualified applicants. But Tom Homan, the White House border czar, defended the move. ""There are a lot of roles at ICE for people who are over 40,"" he told Time magazine. ""Just because someone comes in and they're 55—maybe they can't carry a badge and a gun, they can certainly do administrative duty, they can do targeting on the intelligence team.""

John Sandweg, acting director of ICE under the Obama administration, told Time that recruiting from retired federal law enforcement was a ""pretty creative solution"" to quickly fill thousands of openings and get boots on the ground. Retired law enforcement officers won't need as much training as fresh recruits, who take much longer to hire, undergo a background check, receive security clearances, and get trained at Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers with limited capacity.

ICE recruitment efforts have also targeted active local law enforcement officers. At the end of July, ICE sent recruitment emails to Florida law enforcement seeking ""officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty,"" reports CNN. The recruitment effort angered local sheriffs who previously agreed to partner with ICE on deportation efforts and are unable to match the hiring benefits offered by the agency.

Despite the heavy-handed recruitment efforts, Sandweg told Time that it will likely take ""three years before you see a significant increase of ICE agents on the street.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/08/8-13-25-v1-a.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 18:56:58.715230

Dan Goldman (NY-10), one week after he and two congressional colleagues, Rep. Espaillat and Rep. Velázquez, were turned away.

Lawmakers have been trying to enter MDC to see the conditions in which around 100 immigrants are being held.

Goldman says that last week, Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials promised to accommodate a tour of the facility if given advanced notice of a visit, so he gave notice on Friday, August 8th.

Despite the advanced notice, he wasn't allowed in.

Under Section 527(a) of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, members of Congress are given the authority to inspect any facility being used by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain or house immigrants -- without any prior notice needed.

""I want to understand why they are not letting me in,"" Goldman said.

In July, Goldman and 11 other members of Congress filed a suit against the Trump administration over its refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan.

""A federal judge found that DHS was holding immigration detainees in illegal and unconstitutional conditions at 26 Federal Plaza and ordered DHS to immediately improve those inhumane conditions,"" Goldman said in a statement. ""For months, DHS denied allegations of dreadful conditions and prevented me from accessing the 26 Federal Plaza detention facility to inspect the conditions. Now we know that DHS has been lying to the American people for months.""

Last month, videos obtained by Eyewitness News purported to show the conditions inside the facility at 26 Federal Plaza.

Videos shared by a detainee with a local civic group appeared to show over a dozen people inside the room, with several detainees laying on the cement floor on thermal blankets. It also showed two toilets that were separated from the rest of the men by only a waist-high wall.

Goldman pointed out that the denial of access came less than 24 hours after a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to improve conditions at a separate ICE detention facility at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, where Goldman has also been trying to enter the facility to expose inhumane conditions.

""BOP is now helping DHS stash immigrants in their jails and preventing members of Congress from conducting oversight,"" Goldman said. ""The American people deserve a government that tells the truth, follows the law, and does not cover up abuse.""

Rural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.
Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.
The administration’s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.
The Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.","If the Trump administration succeeds in barring undocumented immigrants from federally funded “public benefit” programs, vulnerable children and families across California would suffer greatly, losing access to emergency shelters, vital healthcare, early education and life-saving nutritional support, according to state and local officials who filed their opposition to the changes in federal court.

The new restrictions would harm undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens — including the U.S.-born children of immigrants and people suffering from mental illness and homelessness who lack documentation — and put intense stress on the state’s emergency healthcare system, the officials said.

Head Start, which provides tens of thousands of children in the state with early education, healthcare and nutritional support, may have to shutter some of its programs if the new rules barring immigrants withstand a lawsuit filed by California and other liberal-led states, officials said.

In a declaration filed as part of that litigation, Maria Guadalupe Jaime-Milehan, deputy director of the child care and developmental division of the California Department of Social Services, wrote that the restrictions would have an immediate “chilling effect” on immigrant and mixed-status families seeking support, but also cause broader “ripple effects” — especially in rural California communities that rely on such programs as “a critical safety net” for vulnerable residents, but also as major employers.

“Children would lose educational, nutritional, and healthcare services. Parents or guardians may be forced to cut spending on other critical needs to fill the gaps, and some may even be forced out of work so they can care for their children,” Jaime-Milehan said.

Rural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.

Tony Thurmond, California’s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the “chilling effect” from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to “seek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.”

Thurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states’ lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s new rules. Six other officials from California also submitted declarations.

The lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies — including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture — that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants.

The announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would “uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.”

Trump’s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain “life or safety” programs — including those now being targeted for new restrictions.

The order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to “prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.”

California and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law.

“We’re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we’re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said.

In addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues.

The declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out.

Beth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness — including undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens.

“Individuals experiencing homelessness periodically lack identity and other documents that would be needed to verify their citizenship or immigration status due to frequent moves and greater risk of theft of their belongings,” she wrote.

Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.

“But if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,” Chawla wrote. “This will exacerbate their health conditions.”

Greta S. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county’s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county’s children have at least one foreign-born parent — among the highest rates anywhere in the country.

The administration’s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.

“The cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara’s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,” Hansen wrote.

The Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.

In response to the states’ motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it.

They wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies “merely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,” and “restore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.”

GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.
GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.
“For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage.
Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable.","A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to give the operator of the immigrant detention center in Tacoma another chance to make its case for paying detainees as little as $1 per day.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request from The GEO Group, the for-profit company that runs the facility, to reconsider its decision from earlier this year, siding with lower courts that found GEO violated state minimum wage law.

The decision affirms that the Florida-based GEO Group will need to pay more than $23 million that a jury and federal judge previously awarded. The next step in the company’s fight could be the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, brought by detainees and the state of Washington, has been ongoing since 2017.

GEO Group has run the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma since 2005. Its current contract with the federal government, signed in 2015, awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade. The facility holds people detained by federal immigration enforcement on civil violations as they await potential deportation or release back into the United States.

The company used to run a voluntary work program for detainees. For years, hundreds at the Tacoma detention center were paid $1 per day, the minimum federal pay required in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. When necessary to attract workers, pay would go up to $5.

The program allowed GEO to avoid hiring 85 full-time employees, according to court filings. The detainees would cook and serve food, wash dishes, do laundry and clean the facility.

GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.

The company had argued federal contractors couldn’t be forced to pay Washington’s minimum wage under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that federal law takes precedence over state law.

GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.

A U.S. District Court jury in 2021 found GEO Group violated Washington’s minimum wage statute, and awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages. A federal judge ordered the company to pay the state an additional $5.9 million in penalties. The work program has been suspended since then.

Between 2010 and 2018, GEO made around $20 million per year running the 1,575-bed detention center.

Washington’s state Supreme Court also sided with the detainees and the state, finding in 2023 that the detained workers should be considered employees.

On this go-around, GEO asked the original three-judge 9th Circuit panel either to rehear the case or send it to the full appeals court in what is known as a rehearing en banc. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice also urged the court to reconsider. The court denied the requests Wednesday.

Dissenting from the decision, Judge Patrick Bumatay, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote that “the effect of this decision will be widespread.”

“Our court provides a ‘roadmap’ for States seeking to undermine federal policies with which they disagree,” Bumatay wrote. “Our court’s message is clear: So long as States focus their regulation on federal government contractors — rather than on the federal government itself — the States may frustrate the performance of any federal government activities they wish.”

Chief Judge Mary Murguia, who President Barack Obama appointed, disagreed. She wrote that Bumatay equating the federal government and its contractors is “contrary to long-settled black letter law.”

“Adoption of his position would allow any government contractor to refuse to pay state-mandated minimum wage to its employees,” she continued. “For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage. No one in this case, not even GEO, has suggested that this is the law.”

The facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington, has a history of allegations of human rights violations. It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with Trump’s return to office.

The Legislature has long had the detention center in its sights. Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable.

Washington has also been ensconced in years of legal back-and-forth with GEO over state laws calling for greater oversight of the facility. Another court case tackling that issue is currently awaiting a ruling from the 9th Circuit.

A total of 372 organizations have coalesced to oppose the administration’s decision to make more federally funded health and human service programs off-limits to immigrants with some form of permission to be in the country.

The groups say the administration wrongly promotes the expanded restrictions as part of its efforts to target illegal immigration. The policy actually “directly targets lawfully present immigrants” by turning early learning centers, community health centers and mental health and addiction treatment programs “into immigration checkpoints” where providers would have to check a person’s immigration status, according to the groups.

“Undocumented immigrants already are not eligible for most federally funded programs. This is another case where the administration is lying to the public,” said Adriana Cadena, director of the Protecting Immigration Families coalition, which led the organizations’ opposition to restrictions to be implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As a result, the restrictions will harm millions, the groups stated in official comments filed in response to the administration's expanded restrictions, published in the Federal Register July 14.

The deadline for public comment on the new restrictions was set for 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.

One in 4 children in the U.S. are in a family with at least one immigrant parent. In 2023, 86% of those children were born in the U.S., making them U.S. citizens, according to Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank. (President Donald Trump also wants to change such birthright citizenship.)

Even if a U.S. citizen child is entitled to use a program, the Trump administration's restrictions are likely to cause confusion and misunderstanding, Cadena said, because of the many children who are in families whose members have different types of immigration status.

""This is going to have long-term consequences we cannot begin to grasp,"" she said.

In response to an NBC News request for comment, the White House sent a link to a July 10 news release by HHS announcing the new restrictions. The administration said in the release that it was ensuring that public benefits were not “diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.”

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., stated in the July 10 release. “Today’s action changes that — it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.”

Expanding the programs restricted to 'qualified' immigrants

The 1996 Personal Responsibility Reconciliation Act restricted the eligibility for federal public benefits to certain “qualified” immigrants, according to KFF, a health policy group.

Qualified immigrants have been defined as those lawfully present in the U.S. and do not include people with Temporary Protected Status, those who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and others, KFF reported.

The HHS has added 13 more programs to the list of programs open only to qualified immigrants.

Those newly added by the administration include Head Start, some of the funding for community health centers, family planning services, child welfare prevention, kinship guardian assistance, substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery and mental health services and the Community Services Block Grant, the groups said. The federal government has said the list is not comprehensive and more programs could be added later.

The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that ""reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive.""

Restrictions on the HHS programs announced in July were to be effective immediately. Groups said little guidance has been given to providers regarding their implementation, creating confusion and having a chilling effect on people who are eligible for the programs and benefits as well as on the nonprofits, local governments and others who provide them.

Several states have sued over the changes, which they said would also affect programs such as Meals on Wheels, domestic violence shelters, housing assistance and more. A lawsuit also was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of parent groups challenging Trump’s policies on Head Start.

The administration provided a 30-day comment period for the new restrictions.

""We do not necessarily expect that there is a real interest from the administration to seek comment on public policy that will impact millions of people,"" Cadena said.

""This is all about the Trump administration's governmentwide attack on immigrant families, and to dismantle the safety net system that many Americans rely on,"" she said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250813-miami-headstart-program-education-ac-448p-878f3c.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 19:56:54.102805

Stripping away half of that workforce during the height of hurricane season, he said, puts every coastal state at risk.
Shifting more than 100 key FEMA employees to ICE to carry out your mass deportation initiative puts Americans at risk.
We are in the height of hurricane season, where a major storm is a true all-hands-on-deck moment.
I strongly urge you to immediately reverse this decision and bring these key employees back to FEMA before it’s too late.","Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) today sent a letter to Trump’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanding she reverse her decision to reassign half of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) human resources and security employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for 90 days – in the middle of peak hurricane season.

Pallone called the move “short-sighted” and “extremely dangerous,” warning it would gut FEMA’s ability to respond to hurricanes and other disasters during the most critical months of the year for coastal states like New Jersey.

“A mass detail during hurricane season is unheard of precisely because past leadership recognized that doing so would kneecap FEMA’s ability to keep Americans safe,” Pallone wrote. “…The Trump Administration fired and pushed into early retirement one-third of FEMA’s workforce, crippling its ability to respond to back-to-back disasters. FEMA’s workforce is now stretched perilously thin managing numerous ongoing disasters.”

Pallone’s letter cites the recent devastating floods in Texas as well as ongoing recovery issues in North Carolina and other major flooding events across the country. He warned that removing more than 100 key FEMA employees now will slow or block the delivery of lifesaving aid in the aftermath of storms.

The Trump Administration’s reassignment of FEMA staff is also part of a broader shift in federal priorities under Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) which dramatically expands ICE funding, enabling a mass deportation initiative, while slashing key social safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Pallone noted that Republicans in Congress passed the OBBB with over $30 billion specifically to expand ICE staffing, making the poaching of FEMA staff unnecessary for immigration enforcement.

“When it comes to disaster response, our nation should not shoot from the hip,” Pallone wrote. “Emergency management isn’t just FEMA’s job, it’s America’s promise to our citizens.”

Pallone emphasized that FEMA’s human resources and security teams are essential to disaster operations – rapidly hiring recovery workers, securing contracts, conducting background checks, and protecting field operations. Stripping away half of that workforce during the height of hurricane season, he said, puts every coastal state at risk.

With experts forecasting an above-average hurricane season, including the likelihood of multiple major storms, Pallone urged Noem to “bring these key employees back to FEMA before it’s too late.”

The full letter is available here and below:

Secretary Noem:

I urge you to immediately reverse your decision to detail half of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) human resources and security staff to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Making this decision in the middle of peak hurricane season is yet another example of dangerous decisions you and FEMA’s Acting Director David Richardson have demonstrated and put the health and safety of my constituents on the Jersey Shore at risk.

Reassigning more than 100 key FEMA employees to ICE for 90 days during the months of August, September, and October is not only short-sighted, but also extremely dangerous. A mass detail during hurricane season is unheard of precisely because past leadership recognized that doing so would kneecap FEMA’s ability to keep Americans safe. I was already concerned about the agency’s capacity to respond to hurricanes impacting the Jersey Shore after learning that FEMA got rid of 2,000 employees.

Based on the evidence, FEMA is understaffed, poorly managed and woefully unprepared for what forecasters claim will be an above-average hurricane season. The Trump Administration fired and pushed into early retirement one-third of FEMA’s workforce crippling its ability to respond to back-to-back disasters. FEMA’s workforce is now stretched perilously thin managing numerous ongoing disasters. This includes the recent devastating Texas floods, which left Americans without promised services, and ongoing recovery issues in North Carolina and other major flooding events across the country.

Shifting more than 100 key FEMA employees to ICE to carry out your mass deportation initiative puts Americans at risk. In response to a major disaster, FEMA depends on their human resources and security teams to surge assistance into impacted communities with hundreds of local hires, recovery contracts, background investigations, and field operations security. Poaching employees from FEMA is also unnecessary given that Republicans in Congress passed the One Big Ugly Bill that supercharges ICE with over $30 billion for the sole purpose of hiring additional agents that they do not even need.

When it comes to disaster response, our nation should not shoot from the hip. Asking communities and states to face extreme weather alone is wrong. Emergency management isn’t just FEMA’s job; it’s America’s promise to our citizens.

Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration.
The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.
Trump administration sees 'big win' Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.
“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote.","WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court’s ruling that had required the Trump administration to spend foreign aid dollars approved by Congress.

But instead of addressing the central argument of the lawsuit — that a president cannot refuse to spend money approved by lawmakers, who hold the power of the purse — the Circuit Court in a potentially significant decision said the organizations that filed the case didn’t have the authority to do so.

Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in her 33-page opinion that only the comptroller general, who leads the Government Accountability Office, has the power to bring lawsuits when a president impounds, or refuses to spend, congressionally approved funds. The GAO is an independent, non-partisan watchdog agency that works for Congress.

“Because the grantees lack a cause of action, we need not address on the merits whether the government violated the Constitution by infringing on the Congress’s spending power through alleged violations of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the ICA and the Anti-Deficiency Act,” Henderson wrote. The ICA is the Impoundment Control Act, which is the legal mechanism through which the president can delay or withhold funds.

Henderson was nominated to the Circuit Court in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, a few years after President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.

Henderson wrote that she and Judge Gregory G. Katsas, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, concluded “the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction” for several reasons.

Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration. The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.

Henderson wrote that “within weeks, the State Department and USAID suspended or terminated thousands of grant awards.”

‘It is our responsibility to check the president’

Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, issued a 46-page dissenting opinion, arguing the ruling from her two colleagues was “procedurally and substantively flawed.”

“It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority,” Pan wrote. “We fail to do that here.”

Pan wrote she disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Trump withholding certain foreign aid funding was “a mere violation of the Impoundment Control Act that should be addressed by the Comptroller General.”

“In this case, the President’s violation of the Impoundment Control Act is a sideshow,” Pan wrote. “That statute provided a mechanism for the President to lawfully attempt to impound the funds, and his failure to follow its prescribed procedures is evidence that he was, in fact, refusing to obligate the funds in defiance of Congress.”

Public media funding targeted

The Trump administration has used the Impoundment Control Act one time this year, when it requested Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.

The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full request in mid-June.

Senate Republicans approved the bill in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

House GOP lawmakers then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature just before a 45-day clock ran out.

Trump administration sees 'big win'

Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.

“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote. “We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.”

Vought wrote the ruling was a “Big win!”

An OMB spokesperson wrote in a statement the ruling represented a victory for the White House.

“Radical left dark-money groups have been using the court system to seize control of U.S. foreign policy,” the spokesperson wrote. “Today’s decision stops these private groups from maliciously interfering with the President’s ability to spend responsibly and administer foreign aid in a lawful manner and in alignment with his America First policies.”

Lauren Bateman, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the suit, wrote in a statement that the court's ruling represented ""a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles.

""We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration's unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance. In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the Administration’s unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world’s most vulnerable people.""",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/trumpjan202025_0.jpg?h=a580faff&itok=qIC4g4WA,N,,2025-08-13 17:56:40.760457

Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia questioned the DOJ over the lawsuit, which alleges that the Maryland district court overstepped its authority by imposing a standing order that automatically pauses deportation cases for two days when they are first filed.

Cullen, a Trump appointee, told DOJ attorneys early on in the hearing he was wary of their position.

""One of the things about me is that I don’t have a very good poker face, and you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,"" Cullen said.

TRUMP DHS SUES ENTIRE BENCH OF FEDERAL JUDGES IN MARYLAND DISTRICT COURT OVER AUTOMATIC INJUNCTIONS

The Virginia federal judge is presiding over the case in Baltimore because the Maryland judges recused themselves. Cullen said he would issue a decision by Labor Day on whether he would block the standing order.

DOJ attorney Elizabeth Hedges argued during the hearing that the Maryland court's order had the effect of ""tampering with the [U.S.] attorney general’s discretion"" over immigration enforcement matters.

The order requires clerks to immediately enter administrative injunctions that last two business days in cases brought by alleged illegal immigrants who are challenging their detentions or removals. The injunctions have the effect of temporarily barring the Department of Homeland Security from deporting or changing the legal status of an immigrant until a judge has time to review the case.

Hedges argued that the judges automatically enter the orders in these cases even if the court lacks jurisdiction in some of them.

The lawsuit, brought in June, comes as the Trump administration has taken an aggressive public posture against individual federal judges who have blocked enforcement of many of the president's executive actions, including in areas of immigration, education and federal agency cuts.

President Donald Trump has complained his agenda has been hamstrung and has called for the impeachment of certain judges whose orders he disagrees with. But the Supreme Court has, in many cases, overrode judges and allowed Trump to temporarily implement his executive actions while the lawsuits proceed in the lower courts.

Attorney Paul Clement, arguing on behalf of the Maryland judges, said during the hearing that there were ""less confrontational"" alternatives to resolving differences with the courts than suing every member of a district court.

Clement, a renowned conservative lawyer who served as former President George Bush's solicitor general, defended the standing order, calling it a ""modest effort to preserve the judiciary's ability to perform its constitutionally assigned role.""

'LAWLESS AND INSANE': TRUMP ADMIN READIES FOR FIGHT AFTER JUDGES BLOCK ABREGO GARCIA REMOVAL FOR NOW

Chief Judge George Russell of Maryland said he issued the standing order as a scheduling convenience to make sure the ""status quo"" is preserved when a deportation case is filed. He cited a ""recent influx"" of cases involving detained immigrants that were being filed after normal court hours, including on weekends and holidays.

The lawsuit represents a test of the independence of the judiciary branch. Clement said it was ""fundamentally incompatible"" with the separation of powers.

""We just don’t have a tradition of suits that are executive versus judiciary, executive versus Congress, Congress versus the executive,"" Clement said, adding that ""we don’t really expect one branch to sue another to try to vindicate its institutional interests.""

The lawsuit also comes as Trump's mass deportation agenda has encountered some roadblocks as immigrants raise court challenges and appeals to their removals.

The group said they left with more questions after being denied the opportunity to speak with detainees and being told that ICE officials would get back to them with answers.

""We leave here with more questions than we came in with, and it was that way the last time we were here,"" Mfume said. ""They've promised to get back to us on at least 20, 25 issues that have come up.""

""We just want answers, we want the truth, the facts, and we want to find a way to make sure that's public and transparent,"" he added.

According to Van Hollen, the group was told they could not talk to detainees at the ICE facility under Maryland law. However, the senator said the state law that the agency referred to does not prohibit members of Congress from talking with detainees.

""Clearly, they don't want us talking to the people who are detained here today or in the future,"" he said.

""As a senior member of a House oversight committee and as the ranking member of the government operations committee, we have clear congressional jurisdiction over ICE,"" Mfume said.

Following the visit from lawmakers on Wednesday, Van Hollen argued that the Baltimore holding facility serves as a detention center, claiming that there are reports of people being held for eight days.

Under ICE policy, holding facilities are designed to keep detainees for up to 12 hours.

""If you look at the people in these rooms, they are clearly being detained,"" Van Hollen said.

The agency previously responded to those allegations in a statement saying, ""ICE Baltimore operates a holding room, not a detention facility, and therefore is not subject to the standards outlined in the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards.""

Van Hollen also mentioned that, according to ICE data, nearly 84% detainees fall under a category of ""no threat level,"" conflicting with the Trump administration's claim that ICE would be going after the ""worst of the worst.""

""They said they were going after the worst of the worst,"" Van Hollen said. ""That would be warranted, and that would be totally appropriate if that were true.""

The lawmakers said they are hoping to get answers after leaving ICE leaders with a list of questions.

WJZ has reached out to ICE for comment.

Claims of inhumane conditions

In June, the Amica Center and National Immigration Project filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two women who were being held at the Baltimore ICE facility.

According to the lawsuit, the women were held for long periods in ""inhumane"" holding rooms, which allegedly violate ICE policies.

The lawsuit claimed ICE detainees can only be held for 12 hours in holding facilities. However, during a hearing in July, the Department of Justice argued that the lawsuit was incorrect.

Other immigration advocates have also raised concerns about conditions at the Baltimore ICE facility.

In March, the Amica Center and the nonprofit CASA held a rally where attendees criticized the size of the holding rooms, the lack of medical staff, and the lack of a food service contract.

ICE responded in a statement, saying its Health Service Corps is on site to provide necessary medical services.

""In the event of a medical emergency, detainees are promptly transported to nearby hospitals to receive immediate and appropriate care,"" the agency said.

U.S. Rep. Sarah Elfreth, during her tour, described the detainment rooms as tight.

""If there were 40 people in one of those rooms, you wouldn't be able to sit down all at the same time,"" she said.

Mfume questions how those with medical and sanitary needs are being treated,

""Some of our concerns are, what happens with women who have sanitary needs? What happens to people who have daily medications that were not on them when they're apprehended, and what happens to those who come in not being classified by nationality?"" Mfume said.

Initial ICE visit denied

In July, the lawmakers claimed their initial plans to visit the facility in July were ""unlawfully denied.""

""This does not bode well here in Baltimore or anywhere if members of the United States Congress, who are duly authorized to come in and to inspect, visit, or walk through a federal facility, are not allowed in,"" said Mfume, who is a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

In response, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted on social media, saying the lawmakers should have scheduled a tour at least one week in advance.

""Congressman, if you need a photo op with the violent criminal illegal aliens you are protecting, schedule a TOUR,"" the DHS posted on X.

US lawmakers sue over access to ICE facilities

In late July, 12 Democratic Congressmembers filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming there was an effort to limit access to detention centers that hold immigrants.

U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md) was among the leaders who joined the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, leaders alleged that the Trump administration is blocking their attempts to enter ICE detention centers and delaying plans to inspect the facilities.

""I hope that what happened here in Baltimore, by being able to gain access to a federal facility, starts now to happen all over the country,"" Mfume said Wednesday. ""If indeed we are to be the example, so be it. We just have to have transparency.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/14/03f35d30-a09b-436f-84a0-cc8cb079e326/thumbnail/1200x630/5bd1c7ae47c97c102497537e7f89bb2d/ice-facility.png,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:33.476388

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being “deported” and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.
Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, Rosario “explicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children’s deportation and had never provided consent for such action.
Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.","Despite being American citizens, three children — a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 kidney cancer, his 7-year-old sister and a 2-year-old girl — were swept up along with their families by immigration authorities in Louisiana and quickly sent to Honduras, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the families.

The suit alleges that despite the government’s own directives, the parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.” The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S.

Instead, the families were “illegally deported without even a semblance of due process,” the lawsuit states.

Romeo, as the now 5-year-old is identified in the lawsuit, was diagnosed with a “rare and aggressive form of kidney cancer,” at age 2. He immediately began receiving ongoing “critical, life-saving medical treatment” in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms.

“The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit said.

The suit was filed on behalf of the two mothers and their children in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The plaintiffs’ names in the lawsuit are pseudonyms to protect their identities and safety, attorneys said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States.

“This is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,” Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being “deported” and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.

“Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.”

McLaughlin said that when there is “an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.”

NBC News has previously reported on U.S. citizen children being sent with their deported immigrant parents to other countries, including a 10-year-old girl recovering from a rare brain tumor sent to Mexico.

Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children and their passports, according to the lawsuit.

Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states. Rosario came to the U.S. in 2013 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor. She gave birth to her first child, Ruby, in 2018 in New Orleans, and her second child, Romeo, in 2020.

In the lawsuit, Rosario claims she didn’t know an immigration case against her was playing out while she was in the U.S. She said she only found out she had a removal order dating back 10 years after she was taken into ICE custody during a traffic stop in February.

The mother of two was given an ankle monitor and had check-ins with ICE both at her home and at their local office, the suit states.

On April 24, Rosario showed up at her immigration check-in with her attorney and children, along with their passports, per ICE’s instructions. At the appointment, Rosario and her children were taken to a back room without their attorney and told they would be deported, according to the lawsuit.

ICE allegedly asked Rosario to sign a document without telling her what it was and Rosario refused. Agents allegedly dismissed her pleas to speak with her attorney about Romeo’s condition.

Her attorney then learned that the family had been transferred to a facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, three hours away. The attorney filed a stay of removal for Rosario’s family that included evidence of Romeo’s Stage 4 cancer diagnosis.

The family was boarded on a plane the next day.

According to the lawsuit, Rosario “explicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children’s deportation and had never provided consent for such action. Indeed, given Romeo’s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.”

Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states.

Julia first arrived at the U.S. border in 2019 fleeing Honduras, after her daughter Janelle was kidnapped there, according to the details in the lawsuit. After applying for asylum, they were forced to wait in Mexico at the time under Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. They said in the lawsuit they were kidnapped in Mexico before they were able to return to the U.S. in August 2021.

Her daughter Jade was born in Louisiana in 2023.

Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.

On April 22, Julia, who was now pregnant, attended a check-in with her daughters as her partner waited outside. She said she was told her family was being transferred to Alexandria and that a judge would determine their fate in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Her partner alleges he was told his family was transferred hours later and he was not given time to speak to Julia.

Later that night, Julia was told she would be deported along with her children.

Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia’s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. citizen.

While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras.

“When Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,” the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress.

“At no point was Julia provided an opportunity to arrange for care of her U.S. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.”

DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” The agency said parents “can take control of their departure” by self-deporting.

Julia and her children were sent to Honduras on April 25 on the same plane as Rosario’s family.

Rosario said in a statement that in Honduras she lacks the resources to care for her children the way they need.

“Since returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I’ve been struggling with my own health issues too,” she said.

Julia said in a statement she thought she and her children were going to a regular appointment, but she was lied to. “I never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras,” she said.

“Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard,” she said. “We were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-ice-officer-vl-506p-9f45d8.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 17:57:30.406094

President Donald Trump said he may declare a national emergency to maintain control of Washington, D.C.'s police force if Congress doesn't work with him to extend the current federalization plan.

Trump made the statement during a press conference at the Kennedy Center in Washington, arguing he can maintain control over the Metropolitan Police Department indefinitely if he declares a national emergency. Under the current structure, the federal government took control over the MPD for a 30-day period on Monday.

""Your federalization of the police has a 30-day limit unless Congress acts to extend it. Are you talking to Congress about extending it, or do you believe 30 days is sufficient?"" asked Daily Signal White House reporter Elizabeth Troutman Mitchell.

""Well, if it's a national emergency, we can do it without Congress. But we expect to be before Congress very quickly. And again, we think the Democrats will not do anything to stop crime, but we think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously. So we're going to need a crime bill. That we're going to be putting in, and it's going to pertain initially to DC. We're going to use it as a very positive example.""

TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS—BUT SOME WELCOME IT

Trump announced his D.C. crime and homelessness crackdown last week, calling in the National Guard and federal law enforcement in addition to federalizing the MPD.

Law enforcement has arrested more than 100 people since Aug. 7, which includes 43 who were arrested Tuesday, a White House official told Fox Digital Wednesday morning. The arrests are part of Trump’s March executive order, which established the Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force, ahead of Trump's Monday announcement federalizing the D.C. police department.

""President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital. ""In less than one week, over 100 violent criminals have already been arrested and taken off of the streets in Washington, D.C. President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital.""

The White House says those living in homeless encampments in the nation's capital will have two choices in the coming days: accept treatment at a homeless shelter, or go to jail. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivered the message during a Tuesday press conference.

""Seventy homeless encampments have been removed by the U.S. Park Police,"" Leavitt said, adding that the Metropolitan Police Department would be joining the Park Police in the effort. ""There are only two homeless encampments remaining in D.C. federal parks under the National Park Service's jurisdiction, and the removal of those two remaining camps is scheduled for this week.""

Democracy Forward and Massachusetts Law Reform Institute filed the suit in the District of Massachusetts on Monday, challenging the end of the CBP One app, a online appointment system and subsequent parole program for people seeking to legally immigrate to the United States.

The complaint states that the government’s decision to end CBP One earlier this year resulted in immigrants ”living in the United States legally to being deemed 'illegal aliens’ overnight.“ Immigrants who came in through that app system lost legal status and are technically undocumented. The suit seeks to reverse that decision for parolees already in the United States, restoring the parole they had been granted.

“We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs, their homes, and their access to food, health care, and they even now face the threat of detention or deportation back to dangerous conditions,” said Ciro Valiente, spokesperson for Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts.

Plaintiffs said the decision by the Trump administration is a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, and that the government can only end parole early on a case-by-case basis, not en masse like what happened with the CBP One cancellation.

Launched in 2020, the CBP One program was initially for commercial trucking companies to schedule cargo inspections. The app was expanded in 2023 to allow migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry on the southern border. Immigrants seeking entry without appointments would typically be turned away. Over two years, nearly a million people scheduled appointments.

The three individual plaintiffs include a Haitian woman living in Massachusetts and the Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts, which said it has at least 473 parolees in Massachusetts, and nearly 5,000 in its organization nationwide. The other plaintiffs are a Cuban woman living in Texas and a woman living in Ohio, originally from Venezuela. The plaintiffs are seeking class certification so the court’s decision would apply nationwide.

The Massachusetts individual plaintiff, anonymized as “Olivia Doe,” is a Haitian who arrived through the app, and had a border patrol inspection before being allowed into the U.S. Her parole was supposed to continue until Nov. 30, 2026, and she also has a pending asylum hearing for December 2027. Her work permit has been revoked, along with her legal status.

It is unclear how many other immigrants arrived in Massachusetts through the app-based program and are in the same situation. The thousands of people nationwide with the legal status received an April email from the Department of Homeland Security, which said: “It is time for you to leave the United States.” The email includes no reasoning for the termination of people’s status.

“They complied with all of the instructions. They’ve done everything that they were supposed to do,” said Heather Arroyo, senior immigration attorney at MLRI. “This was just arbitrarily stripped from them.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/544d8fb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4967x2608+0+542/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F57%2F82%2F21ce480446109c0b264c8eac42c1%2Fap25140549081410.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 15:56:54.362767

Last week, FAIR’s marquee 2025 report estimating the illegal alien population in the U.S. was updated to include, at the end, a state-by-state breakdown based on new data. FAIR’s study was the first to account for the Census Bureau bombshell showing millions more illegal aliens live in the U.S. than previously thought. It is now clear from this update that the 2021-2024 wave of illegal immigration had its strongest impacts in places far from the border and least equipped to handle them.

Estimating each state’s illegal alien population in 2025 meant challenging previous assumptions because, as the report details, illegal immigration itself drastically changed over the past few years. For example, a border wall, high prices, and a slow economy made traditional gateway California a much less attractive destination for illegal aliens than in past decades. Permissive policies drew illegal aliens from across the entire world, rather than mostly from nearby countries like Mexico, and these new arrivals were less drawn to established illegal alien communities.

At the same time, the Biden administration was flying illegal aliens directly into cities in the interior of the U.S. at taxpayer expense. Administration actions like the abuse of immigration parole authority made it easier for illegal aliens to work outside well-established destinations. The result was that newly arrived illegal aliens had far more options, and many unsuspecting cities and towns across the U.S. suddenly found themselves overwhelmed.

Because of these changes, entirely new methodology was needed to estimate the illegal alien population by state. FAIR weighted how fast the foreign-born population grew from 2021-2025 in each state when estimating their current illegal alien populations. This also required separating Biden administration-era illegal aliens from earlier arrivals in our data because the places they ended up in the U.S. were vastly different. These new state population estimates are not directly comparable with earlier years because of the new methodology. However, this is only because our estimates have improved as the proverbial dust settles from the disastrous 2021-2024 illegal migration wave.

While “sanctuary cities” took in many of the most recent arrivals, our estimates show surprisingly high populations in areas far outside these bastions of non-cooperation. Florida, for example, has strong state pro-enforcement policies and requires local governments to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Unfortunately for Floridians, it was also the largest entry point for flights carrying inadmissible illegal aliens allowed in by the Biden administration. This has caused its illegal alien population to swell compared to traditional gateways like New York and California.

Last Thursday, President Trump announced that the Department of Commerce is starting work on a new census that would not count illegal aliens present in the United States.

The announcement states that the census would be based on data from the 2024 election. Conducted every 10 years, the next census had been scheduled for 2030.

The rapid growth of the illegal alien population in the U.S. threatens to significantly affect congressional representation in the House of Representatives, which also determines Electoral College apportionment for presidential elections. After four years of failed anti-borders policies, the total illegal alien population is now estimated to be at least 18.6 million, enough to account for roughly 24 House seats. And because the number of House seats is fixed by law at 435, when one state gains a seat, another state loses that seat. Following the 2020 census–after which more than 10 million illegal aliens poured into the country under the Biden administration–New York, Illinois, and California all lost one House seat each, while Florida gained one seat and Texas two.

The move from President Trump is the latest measure in a battle that started during his first administration. In 2019, the first Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, only to be blocked by the Supreme Court, which called the attempt “contrived.” In a 2020 memorandum, President Trump then determined that “[f]or the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act.” That memo was revoked by President Joe Biden immediately after he took office in 2021.

Congress has already taken steps to ensure that only U.S. citizens are counted for the purposes of apportionment. On January 7, Congressman Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) reintroduced H.R. 151, the Equal Representation Act. That FAIR-supported bill would add a citizenship question to the census starting in 2030 and amend existing law to ensure that noncitizens are not counted towards congressional or Electoral College apportionment. According to Congressman Edwards: “America will be paying the consequences of the previous administration’s open border policies for decades to come. Mass illegal immigration has already diluted the voice of American citizens in the U.S. House and Electoral College. The Equal Representation Act will reverse these problems by asking a very simple question on the U.S. Census, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States?’ Americans deserve fair and equal representation, something that will not be possible until we eliminate the influence of noncitizens in our elections.”

Critics meanwhile, have signaled that such changes would immediately face pushback. Following President Trump’s announcement, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Voting Rights Project Director Sophia Lin Lakin warned that, “We won’t hesitate to go back to court to protect representation for all communities.” The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights also published a factsheet last month on the Equal Representation Act, claiming that citizenship questions on the census would “frighten large numbers of people away from participating in the census entirely.” According to the Leadership Conference, illegal aliens not participating in the census would result in the “misallocation of trillions of dollars in vital federal and state funding for the next decade, unfairly depriving communities throughout the country of needed resources.”

Without commonsense reform, the next census, and resulting congressional and Electoral College reapportionment, could be seriously distorted. Voters have given the Trump administration and 119th Congress a clear mandate to enforce our immigration laws and reverse the effects of harmful open-borders policies. Americans deserve to have their voices fully represented in our nation’s capital, not diluted by individuals who chose to enter the country illegally.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/census-1020.jpg.webp?itok=36l4RYyp,N,,2025-08-13 15:56:58.749163

Trump has also created militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a major shift that has thrust the army into immigration enforcement like never before.

The cases in both California and Washington mainly hinge on Posse Comitatus Act, which passed in 1878 and largely prevents the military from enforcing domestic laws. Experts say that in both cases there are clear limitations to the law’s enforcement.

Here is what to know about the law.

Posse Comitatus Act stops military from enforcing US law

The Posse Comitatus Act is a criminal statute that prevents the military from enforcing domestic law. It also prevents the military from investigating local crimes, overriding local law enforcement or compelling certain behavior.

Posse Comitatus can be bypassed by a congressional vote or in order to defend the Constitution. The Insurrection Act of 1807 can also trigger the suspension of the Posse Comitatus Act and allows the president to deploy the military domestically in cases of invasion or rebellion.

There is an exception for the U.S. Coast Guard, which has some law enforcement responsibility. The military is also allowed to share intelligence and certain resources if there is an overlap with civilian law enforcement jurisdiction, according to the Library of Congress.

Law was enacted after Reconstruction era

The law was enacted in 1878 following the post-Civil War era known as Reconstruction. Pro-segregationist representatives in Congress wanted to keep the military from blocking the enforcement of Jim Crow laws that allowed racial segregation.

But the spirit of the law also has roots going all the way back to the Revolutionary War, when the founders of the United States were scarred by the British monarchy’s absolute military control, said William C. Banks, a professor at the Syracuse University College of Law.

“We have a tradition in the United States, which is more a norm than a law, that we want law enforcement to be conducted by civilians, not the military,” Banks said.

That ethos — ingrained in National Guard personnel starting in basic training — becomes especially powerful in the case of the Posse Comitatus Act, because the law has hardly been tested before now, said Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.

“There is no authoritative precedent on exactly where these lines are, and so that’s why over the years the military’s own interpretation has been so important,” Vladeck said.

Law applies to ‘federalized’ troops

The Posse Comitatus Act typically doesn’t apply to the National Guard because members of the Guard report to the governor, not the federal government.

But when Guard personnel are “federalized” they are bound by the act until they are returned to state control, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

The state of California said in a federal lawsuit that the Trump administration violated the act when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles following June protests over immigration raids.

The Trump administration has argued that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply because the president used a provision known as Title 10 to federalize the troops. It allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Attorneys for the federal government also argue that the troops are not enforcing domestic laws and are only acting to protect federal property and agents.

In Washington, by contrast, the president is already in charge of the National Guard and can legally deploy troops for 30 days without congressional approval.

Vladeck said that both deployments over the past three months suggest that the Trump administration “appears to be trying to dance around the Posse Comitatus Act” rather than disregard it altogether.

“There is a lot in the water about the Trump administration being lawless. What is striking is actually how much the administration is trying to wrap itself in the law,” Vladeck said.

Law depends on executive branch policing itself

Beyond the legal exceptions written into the law, there is a practical question of how to enforce it, said Joseph Nunn, counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.

Because the Posse Comitatus Act is a criminal statute, not a civil one, the U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for prosecution in criminal court, Nunn said.

“It’s premised on the executive branch policing itself,” he said. That leaves unclear legal standing for whether a state government like California’s has a right to sue in civil court in the first place.

The ruling in the California case will likely be a narrow interpretation based on the circumstances of the Guard’s deployment in Los Angeles, Vladeck said. But he said it could still dictate how the administration uses the Guard in other cities like Chicago and New York, where Trump has threatened to federalize troops next.

Last year, the State Department published 103 pages on Israel’s “significant human rights issues.” The new report is just nine pages long.
The report on Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip was just one of 200 hollowed-out reports on human rights that the State Department released Tuesday, which, as expected, whitewash the records of some of the world’s worst violators of human rights.
Experts said the report on Israel was among the most egregious, with its page count plummeting 91 percent from last year.

Last year, the State Department published 103 pages on Israel’s “significant human rights issues.” The new report is just nine pages long.

The congressionally mandated human rights reports, which are used to guide U.S. decisions on diplomacy and aid, have been turned into wholly political documents built to soft-pedal abuses by the administration’s allies and target countries with whom the Trump administration has clashed.

The report on Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip was just one of 200 hollowed-out reports on human rights that the State Department released Tuesday, which, as expected, whitewash the records of some of the world’s worst violators of human rights. Experts said the report on Israel was among the most egregious, with its page count plummeting 91 percent from last year.

While previous editions of the report on Israel — including reports from President Donald Trump’s first term — included significant material on abuses documented by the United Nations and human rights groups, such accounts were mostly omitted from the new report.

“The first Human Rights Report of Secretary Rubio’s tenure can be summarized in just a few more words than it appears to be written in: few truths, many half truths, and nothing like the truth,” said Josh Paul, who spent more than 11 years as the director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department bureau that oversees arms transfers to foreign nations before resigning in 2023 over U.S. military assistance to Israel. “Its coverage of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza appears to have been written by someone who has been blindfolded, earmuffed, had a sock stuffed in their mouth, and then censored.”

Last year’s report referenced “significant human rights issues” – language which is absent from the report released on Tuesday. The report also omits reference to the genocide case that Israel faces at the International Court of Justice over its war on Gaza. Also absent is mention of the International Criminal Court arrest warrants issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The section on war crimes and genocide only states: “Terrorist organizations Hamas and Hizballah continue to engage in the indiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians in violation of the law of armed conflict.”

“Although the Biden administration continued to provide essentially unconditional support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza, the 2023 Human Rights Report on Israel/Palestine documented a large number of Israel’s significant human rights violations,” said Annelle Sheline, who served as a foreign affairs officer in the Office of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor until last year and previously worked on annual country human rights reports. “In contrast, for 2024 — a year characterized by Israel killing likely hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in an indiscriminate campaign of bombing and starvation, in direct violation of U.S. law — the Human Rights Report documents almost none of Israel’s human rights abuses, focusing instead almost exclusively on abuses committed by Hamas.”

The brief section on press freedom in the new report also offers a whitewash of the slaughter of Palestinian journalists. It reads: “NGOs and journalists reported authorities restricted press coverage and limited certain forms of expression, especially in the context of criticism against the war or sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.”

That is a watered-down version of an already cautious chronicle in last year’s report, which stated: “NGOs and Palestinian journalists reported authorities restricted press coverage and limited certain forms of expression, particularly for Palestinians. These included restricting Palestinian journalists’ movement in Israel, as well as using violence, arrests, intimidation, imprisonment, and closure of media outlets on security grounds, according to the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedoms.” The report released in 2024 also cited figures from the Committee to Protect Journalists on the number of reporters and other media workers killed.

Paul, the former State Department official, noted that the new report “suggests that scores of journalists have been killed ‘due to the Israel-Hamas conflict’ — rather than, as is the case, ‘by Israel’ — while also reporting with a straight face Israel’s claim that ‘a number of individuals who posed as journalists … were members of or had direct ties to Hamas and other terrorists in Gaza.’”

On Sunday, Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif was killed alongside several other colleagues in a targeted Israeli attack on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City. The Al Jazeera Media Network condemned the killings as “yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom.”

The section on torture in this year’s report on Israel focuses on the physical, psychological, and sexual abuse of Israeli hostages by Hamas. Regarding torture of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, the report says, “Shin Bet (the Israel Security Agency) and police used violent interrogation methods that it referred to as ‘exceptional measures,’ but the Ministry of Justice did not provide information regarding the frequency of interrogations or the specific interrogation methods used.” Last year’s report referred to “reports of systemic torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment of Palestinian detainees in prison facilities after October 7.”

“This contrast demonstrates most clearly that from the perspective of the Trump administration, if a U.S. partner abuses human rights, Washington does not care,” said Sheline, who also resigned, in March 2024, to protest the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza. “This will have implications far beyond the actions of Israel’s murderous regime, contributing to all U.S. security partners knowing they can abuse their populations with impunity.”

Officially called “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,” the annual documents are required by law to be “a full and complete report regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights” in nearly 200 countries and territories worldwide. They are used “by the U.S. Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches as a resource for shaping policy and guiding decisions, informing diplomatic engagements, and determining the allocation of foreign aid and security sector assistance,” according to the State Department.

“The Human Rights Reports have been among the U.S. Government’s most-read documents,” said Charles Blaha, a 32-year State Department official and now senior adviser to DAWN, a nonprofit organization that promotes democracy and human rights in the Middle East and North Africa. “This year, the Israel, West Bank, and Gaza Reports’ significant omissions render them functionally useless for Congress and the public as nothing more than a pro-Israel document.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25047476708100-e1755109916769.jpeg?fit=4390%2C2195&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-13 15:57:02.980325

Jon Ossoff’s office (D-Georgia) has revealed rampant human rights violations committed against immigrants in detention in the first six months of President Donald Trump’s second term, including dozens of incidents involving the mistreatment of children and pregnant women.

Of the 510 credible reports of human rights abuses uncovered by the investigation, Ossoff’s office identified 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in immigration detention, 14 reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 reports of mistreatment of children.

During the senator’s monthslong investigation, which began in January, Ossoff’s staff “interviewed and received credible reports of abuse from dozens of witnesses and sources, including correctional staff, law enforcement officials, attorneys, detainees and their family members, doctors, and nurses.”

They spoke with 46 people in detention and conducted numerous site visits, although “obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called the report “garbage” and denied the allegations of abuse. Ossoff said DHS’s response is “absurd.”

“For DHS to immediately issue a blanket denial without any due-diligence or investigations of these credible reports of human rights abuses in U.S. facilities, is absurd,” Ossoff said. “It suggests they don’t take seriously their obligation to investigate credible reports of human rights abuses in their facilities.”

The senator’s investigation reported on several incidents that involved the mistreatment of children. In one case, a child, who is a U.S. citizen, was hospitalized three times while detained with her mother.

“[W]hen the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report says. “A CBP guard reportedly responded, ‘Just give the girl a cracker.’”

In another case, a family was arrested and detained on their way to an emergency medical appointment for their daughter who was recovering from brain surgery. The government also deported a 4-year-old who was receiving treatment for kidney cancer. In April, immigration officers abducted the child and his sister, who are both U.S. citizens, along with their mother when they arrived for an immigration appointment. Within 24 hours, they were deported to Honduras.

Ossoff’s office identified more than a dozen credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women detained by DHS. They have been denied adequate medical care and timely checkups, as well as sufficient meals and snacks, according to the investigation. One anonymous agency official reported “seeing pregnant women sleeping on floors in overcrowded intake cells.”

A partner of a pregnant woman in DHS custody relayed their horrific experience to Ossoff’s office. The woman bled for days before she was taken to the hospital, where “she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours.” DHS denied reports of pregnant women sleeping on the floor without providing evidence and insisted that detention of pregnant women is “rare.”

Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, told NBC News that she met with the woman, who was 23 years old and had been living in Georgia. The woman told Yoon that she had experienced and witnessed “terrible conditions,” including, NBC News reported, “overcrowding, people forced to sleep on the floor, inadequate access to nutrition and medical care, as well as abusive treatment by the guards, lack of information about their case and limited ability to contact their loved ones and legal support.”

The senator’s investigation also uncovered numerous allegations of physical and sexual abuse against immigrants. At the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas, staff slammed a man’s head in the ground and handcuffed him for stepping out of line in the dining hall, according to the man’s attorneys. At another lockup, staff reportedly forced at least seven people into “stress positions” to punish them for “laughing and conversing.”

There were at least two 911 calls from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California “referencing reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults,” and at least four emergency calls from the South Texas ICE Processing Center referenced sexual abuse.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush’s solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government’s lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee. His attorneys characterized the charge as an attempt to justify his erroneous deportation. Xinis recently prohibited the administration from taking Abrego Garcia into immediate immigration custody if he’s released from jail pending trial.

An unusual spectacle plays out in Baltimore today. The U.S. Justice Department will face off against all 15 federal judges in the state of Maryland. The DOJ has sued them, arguing they exceeded their authority. NPR's Carrie Johnson reports.

CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: A few months ago, as the Trump administration cracked down on immigration, the chief federal judge in Maryland imposed a 48-hour pause on certain cases filed by people who feared they might be next in line for deportation.

PHILIP PRO: It was a sensible step. It's something courts do all the time.

JOHNSON: That's Philip Pro. He's a retired federal judge from Nevada who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Judge Pro is not involved in this case, but he's speaking up to defend sitting federal judges who can't speak for themselves.

PRO: A two-business-day extension is such a reasonable and brief period that I don't think it could frustrate any executive powers. That's a crisis that's made by the executive with their timing.

JOHNSON: The Trump administration does not see it that way. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the entire federal district court bench in Maryland. Hans von Spakovsky's a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: Well, it's an unprecedented lawsuit, but then what the chief judge did there was unprecedented - issuing a standing order to automatically grant an injunction, which violates all kinds of rules and regulations.

JOHNSON: In court papers, the Justice Department says the Maryland court lacks jurisdiction over those kinds of immigration cases and that the judges sidestepped requirements set out by the Supreme Court.

VON SPAKOVSKY: And that requires actually hearing evidence to meet those standards.

JOHNSON: Both sides are due in court in Maryland today. A federal judge from out of state will oversee the dispute. The DOJ has won some support from immigration hawks and conservative interest groups, but a wide array of advocates are backing the Maryland judges. They include the Maryland State Bar Association, dozens of law firms and retired judges. To them, the case threatens judicial independence and amounts to threatening judges simply for doing their job.

The suit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia argues that the Department of Homeland Security’s new policy to limit or block lawmakers from visiting immigrant detention facilities is unlawful. The members cite an appropriations law in effect since 2019 that grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“This oversight informs potential legislation on the subject of immigration detention, ensures that administration officials are carrying out their responsibilities consistent with federal law, and ensures that funds appropriated to DHS and ICE are being used appropriately on the ground,” according to the suit.

DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

As the Trump administration aims to carry out mass deportations, one of the few tools Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have is oversight of immigration detention centers.

It’s already led to clashes between Democratic lawmakers and immigration officers after New Jersey Democrats protested the reopening of a detention center.

The lawmakers said that since June, they have tried to obtain information about conditions at DHS facilities “for the purpose of conducting real-time oversight of that facility” and each “of those attempted oversight visits has been blocked by” DHS.

For example, Colorado’s Jason Crow, who is part of the suit, said this month he was denied entry to an ICE facility to conduct oversight.

“​​As part of its campaign of mass deportation, the Trump-Vance administration has stretched the U.S. immigration detention system far beyond its capacity,” the suit said.

The suit cites the deaths of 11 people while in immigration custody in the past five months and the unlawful detainment of U.S. citizens, often without access to legal counsel.

“More people are being held by the United States in immigration detention than ever before, with many facilities housing more individuals than they were built to contain,” according to the suit. “Reports of mistreatment have been widespread and have included disturbing details of overcrowding, food shortages, lack of adequate medical care, and unsanitary conditions.”

The suit is being led by the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which is representing the House lawmakers, most of whom are in leadership roles or top Democrats on committees, such as Bennie Thompson of Mississippi on Homeland Security, Jamie Raskin of Maryland on Judiciary and Robert Garcia of California on Oversight and Government Reform.

The other Democrats include Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York; J.

A small town in rural Tennessee will soon be the site of a privately-run Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.

The town of Mason’s 600-bed prison has been sitting empty for nearly four years, but the West Tennessee Detention Facility will soon be filled with ICE detainees from across the mid-South. The mayor and aldermen narrowly approved the contract at a contentious townhall Tuesday night.

Before a crowd of chanting protestors, Mayor Eddie Noeman stressed the economic opportunities for cash-strapped Mason — and his own status as a first-generation immigrant from Egypt.

“Maybe I agree, disagree, but at the end of the day, I’m (looking) for the benefit of the town of Mason,” Noeman said.

A few Mason residents voiced their support for the contract and the jobs it could bring, but a majority spoke against reopening the facility.

“This particular detention center will be less than 20 minutes from my son’s high school. And when he graduates, this is not the job I want him to be able to have,” said resident Civil Miller-Watkins. “Tonight, you’re here to decide how much a Black and Brown body costs … All money is not good money.”

The detention center will be run by CoreCivic, a for-profit prison operator that is currently the subject of a federal civil rights investigation for chronic understaffing and “endemic” violence. The state of Tennessee has fined the company nearly $45 million since 2022 for its inability to staff prisons.

CoreCivic lobbyist Jerry Lankford said the reopening of the prison under ICE will create 240 jobs with an annual salary of $55,000.

“We’ve already had several hundred people submit applications or interest in these jobs,” Lankford said, speaking over shouts of protest from the crowd. “The government partners share a deep commitment to humane care. We are fully committed to that. Our top priority is the safety of the people in our care, our staff and the community.”

Mason resident Darryle Dowell said he worked for the prison when CoreCivic, then called the Corrections Corporation of America, was promising $20 an hour. He said he only received $10 an hour despite a promotion.

“I don’t see no prison,” Dowell said. “I see a concentration camp.”",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/Mason_ICE_AP_25224743518164.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 17:56:54.042967

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush's solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government’s lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration's case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee. His attorneys characterized the charge as an attempt to justify his erroneous deportation. Xinis recently prohibited the administration from taking Abrego Garcia into immediate immigration custody if he’s released from jail pending trial.

The divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel found a lower judge erred when he restored the flow of funds in March.

Two groups of grant recipients sued over allegations the cancellations infringe on the separation of powers since Congress had appropriated the money, but the panel ruled they can’t bring such a claim.

“The district court erred in granting that relief because the grantees lack a cause of action to press their claims. They may not bring a freestanding constitutional claim if the underlying alleged violation and claimed authority are statutory,” U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote for the majority.

An appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, Henderson was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, whom Trump appointed. They noted federal law still allows the Comptroller General to step in and sue.

U.S. Circuit Judge Florence Pan dissented. She was appointed by former President Biden.

“The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells,” Pan wrote.

Pan called the decision “as startling as it is erroneous,” writing that it latches onto a legal argument the administration hadn’t fully developed.

“My colleagues in the majority excuse the government’s forfeiture of what they perceive to be a key argument, and then rule in the President’s favor on that ground, thus departing from procedural norms that are designed to safeguard the court’s impartiality and independence,” Pan wrote.

Trump on his first day in office ordered the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to freeze foreign assistance payments, leading to a blitz of litigation that quickly reached the Supreme Court at an earlier stage of the case.

The Justice Department appealed again after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in March ruled the administration must make available foreign assistance that Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2024. Ali was nominated to the bench by Biden.

Ali’s order also required USAID pay out bills owed through Feb. 13 under existing contracts and grants, but that part of the injunction was not on appeal. Court records indicate substantially all of the owed payments are now complete.

“Today’s decision is a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles,” said Lauren Bateman, an attorney at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group that represents the grant recipients who are suing.

“We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration’s unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance,” she continued. “In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the Administration’s unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world’s most vulnerable people.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/AP25034609359130-e1744216200927.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-13 14:57:39.452866

Daouda Begnon II Kone was removed to Burkina Faso Aug. 5 pursuant to a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

During his immigration proceedings, the court found Kone was ineligible for immigration benefits and that he participated and assisted in the persecution of others during the Sept. 16, 2015, coup d’etat while he was a member of the Presidential Security Regiment under the regime of President Blaise Compaore.

Kone was convicted in Burkina Faso of complicity in an attack on state security, voluntary assault and battery, and murder. He was sentenced to serve seven years in prison, including five years suspended.

“The removal of Kone underscores the important work of ICE HSI agents in investigating those who apply for immigration benefits under false pretenses,” said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Detroit acting Special Agent in Charge Jared Murphey. “You cannot come to the U.S. and try to hide war crimes.”

“The dedicated officers of ERO Detroit are committed to removing this public safety threat and others like him from our communities across Michigan and Ohio,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Detroit acting Field Office Director Kevin Raycraft. “I encourage members of the public to report additional human rights violators to the ICE tipline at 866-DHS-2-ICE.”

The case was investigated by HSI New York and supported by the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center along with significant assistance from HSI and ERO Detroit’s Cincinnati sub-office.

Established in 2009, the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center furthers the government’s efforts to identify, locate and prosecute human rights abusers in the U.S., including those who are known or suspected to have participated in persecution, war crimes, genocide, torture, extrajudicial killings, female genital mutilation and the use or recruitment of child soldiers.

Bush, a Republican.","BALTIMORE — A judge on Wednesday expressed some skepticism about an unprecedented lawsuit in which the Trump administration sued all 15 Maryland-based federal judges over a standing order related to deportation cases.

The lawsuit is the latest escalation of the Trump administration's war on the judiciary, which has been marked by criticism of judges who have ruled against the government over President Donald Trump's bold and aggressive use of executive power.

At issue is a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that set rules for handling cases involving immigrants facing immediate risk of deportation. The order applies a temporary stay of deportation for two business days while the case is considered.

The Justice Department sued, saying Russell had no authority to issue such a blanket order that effectively acts as a broad injunction against government actions without any assessment of whether the individual immigrants have valid cases.

But U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who normally sits in Virginia and was assigned the case because Maryland judges cannot participate, questioned whether the Justice Department took the correct approach in filing a lawsuit.

""You probably picked up that I don’t have a very good poker face,” he said, addressing Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Hedges. “I have some skepticism,” he added.

There are other avenues the government has to challenge the order, he said, including by appealing in a case involving an individual immigrant in which the standing order is applied.

Noting that the Supreme Court in recent months has acted quickly on a flurry of cases involving the Trump administration, Cullen said the dispute may have been resolved by now if the government had filed a regular appeal.

""If recent precedent is any guide, you would already have a decision,"" he added.

Cullen did, however, appear more sympathetic to some of the government's arguments on the merits, noting that government lawyers made a ""fair point"" that even a two-day delay acts as a form of temporary injunction.

A former prosecutor, Cullen was appointed by Trump in 2020 with the backing of Virginia’s two Democratic senators. He said he plans to issue a ruling by Labor Day.

The standing order came in response to the flurry of actions taken by the Trump administration relating to immigration, including moves to deport people without due process. One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country before eventually being returned, arose in Maryland.

The order states that when an immigrant files a petition for habeas corpus in a federal court in Maryland, the government is temporarily prevented from deporting them until the claim can be adjudicated.

The automatic stay has been applied to at least 12 cases so far, the government says.

The standing order is intended in part to ""preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of this court over pending matters,"" Russell wrote.

Hedges argued Wednesday that the order imposes restrictions on the government that courts in most immigration cases have no power to impose.

""We are seeing a huge problem,"" she said.

Hedges added that the lawsuit was not undertaken lightly and similar actions would not become commonplace.

""This is not an assault on the separation of powers,"" she said.

In response to the lawsuit, the Maryland judges hired a legal team that includes Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush, a Republican.

Clement warned in court that if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward toward a trial, it would create a ""nightmare scenario"" in which judges could be deposed and internal judiciary documents could be reviewed by the government.

""All of that is avoided if you go the ordinary route,"" he added, referring to the government filing an appeal in one of the cases rather than suing judges.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250716-pam-bondi-vl-310p-3fb757.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 13:57:52.870208

Attacking democratic U.S. allies for so-called free speech violations while seeking to imprison law-abiding college students at home for peaceful expression against U.S. foreign policy exemplify this administration’s destructive and hypocritical approach to human rights. At the same time, expunging all mention of gender-based violence, LGBTQI+ persons, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups from these reports is a radical move out of step with the American people, international human rights norms, and decades of past practice, including the first Trump administration.”

“Such changes undermine the historic credibility of these reports and their purpose in informing key U.S. government decisions on issues such as security assistance, foreign aid, and whether to provide protection to people fleeing human rights abuses. They also undercut the courageous efforts of political activists, human rights defenders, and others seeking to improve conditions in their home countries,” Zeya concluded.

U.S. law enacted over four decades ago mandates that the State Department provide annual reports on “the observance of and respect for internationally recognized human rights” in every country around the world. It is widely agreed that “internationally recognized human rights” include those articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (which the U.S. had a key role in drafting and which draws on the core rights in the United States’ own founding documents) and treaties to which the U.S. is a party such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Nevertheless, the Trump administration’s most recent reports eliminate information on a wide range of these rights, including the right to peaceful assembly, the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of movement, the right to not be returned to a country where one would suffer torture or persecution, the right to non-discrimination (including for women, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous persons, LGBTQI+ people, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized groups), and the right to participate in one’s government. They also exclude information on key governance issues such as corruption. Such reporting has been included in these reports for many years under both Republican and Democratic administrations and its absence means that Congress and others will have far from the complete picture they need to make informed and responsible decisions about U.S. policy and its implementation. It will have particularly negative consequences for asylum seekers seeking to prove the risks they may face in their home countries.

The reports also noticeably skew the reporting on particular countries where the Trump administration has aligned political interests. For instance, in the reports on El Salvador and Hungary, the State Department concludes that there are no “credible reports of significant human rights issues.” At the same time these reports assert that there have been no changes in the human rights situation in both countries since 2023, when the reports on those same countries itemized a wide range of significant issues. Likewise, the reports on key U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia withhold or downplay accounts of abuses there, compared to recent years. Strikingly, the 2024 reports give Hungary a clean bill of health on human rights, while concluding that the human rights situations in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have worsened due to issues relating to alleged restrictions on freedom of expression and acts of antisemitism. While some of these concerns may be valid, they are given disproportionate attention relative to the many other serious abuses occurring elsewhere around the world.

The Trump administration is threatening to sue and withhold federal funds from more than 20 ""sanctuary"" states, cities and counties, because of their lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The new list, released Aug. 5 by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Public Affairs, includes three states and one city in New England: Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Boston, Massachusetts.

""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.""

Inclusion on the list comes with the explicit threat of lawsuits and federal funding halts. And border czar Tom Homan has previously promised to ""flood"" those jurisdictions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In February, he said he would be ""bringing hell"" to Boston.

Several federal judges have blocked the administration's previous efforts to punish some of those jurisdictions, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

Earlier this year, the White House published and then almost immediately withdrew a significantly longer list after many communities on the list said they were erroneously included. In many of the jurisdictions included on the new list, including Boston, local leaders have argued that allowing police to partner with ICE discourages crime victims and witnesses from coming forward regardless of their immigration status.

In announcing the new list, which also includes both New York City and the state of New York, Chicago and San Francisco, the White House highlighted how Louisville, Kentucky, had agreed to end sanctuary policies while facing threat of a lawsuit.

What is a 'sanctuary jurisdiction'?

There's no specific legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but Bondi's office said it considered things like failure to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, providing government benefits to undocumented immigrants, or refusing to share immigration information about jail detainees.

Federal courts are currently weighing several lawsuits brought by the Trump administration against jurisdictions on the sanctuary list. A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.

Is Boston a 'sanctuary city?'

Under the Trust Act, Boston city law enforcement officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE to carry out civil warrants. The 2014 law makes many characterize Boston as a sanctuary city, though Boston Mayor Michelle Wu's administration doesn't use the term. Boston police officers work with immigration officials only on criminal warrants.

“Whenever someone commits a crime, whenever there’s a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable,” Wu said during a March hearing in front of Congress. “If ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to obtain a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable.”

During that hearing, Wu touted the city's safety record and pushed back against ""the false narrative"" that all immigrants are criminals.

“The false narrative is that immigrants in general are criminals, or immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm, that is actually what is undermining safety in our communities,” Wu said.

Massachusetts was named on the original list of sanctuary states released in May, but it wasn't included this time. MA Gov. Maura Healey has said several times the Massachusetts isn't a sanctuary state.

Which communities have been described as immigrant 'sanctuaries'?

According to the Department of Justice, the following communities are offering ""sanctuary"" to immigrants who lack the legal right to be in this country.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said he was pelted with bottles and had a knife pulled on him while speaking to migrants in a camp in northern France.

The Conservative MP posted a video on social media discussing the incident with Daily Express journalist Zak Garner-Purkis who has accompanied him on his visit to France.

In the clip, Philp says: ""I found it pretty shocking - you said behind me somebody had pulled out some sort of machete and we left pretty quickly.""

Mr Garner-Purkis says the man was ""swinging it around in the air"", adding: ""It was clear he was doing it to send a message to the other people there - whether it was a case of 'don't speak'.""

In the video, the two men are recounting the incident while walking along the side of a road at which point objects can be seen being thrown at them.

Mr Garner-Purkis says ""they are throwing bottles at us"" and Philp says: ""Right, we've got to go.

Philp later posted a message on social media reading: ""Just had a knife pulled on us in the new Jungle camp by Dunkirk and then pelted with bottles while trying to speak to migrants.""

The shadow minister has said he has been visiting the north coast of France to ""find out more about what's happening on the ground with the illegal migration crisis"".

The number of people trying to get to the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats has been increasing for around eight years.

Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 170,000 people have arrived in small boats.

In 2022, 45,755 made the journey, in 2024 it was 37,000 and as of 11 August this year, 27,029 people have arrived in the UK.

In the first three months of the year, Afghans made up the top nationality of people arriving by small boat, followed by Syrians, Iranians, Vietnamese and Eritreans.

In a bid to reduce numbers making the crossing, the Labour government has taken steps to ""smash the gangs"" that organise crossings including spending £100m to fund 300 National Crime Agency officers to tackle people-smugglers.

It has also reached a 'one-in, one-out' agreement to send some arrivals back to France and in exchange, the UK will take in asylum seekers in France who have not tried to make the crossing.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the deal was a ""product of months of grown-up diplomacy"" which would ""deliver real results"".

The Conservatives have criticised the government for scrapping their Rwanda plan which aimed to send arrivals to the East African country where they would have had their asylum applications processed.

Earlier this week, Philp said: ""Labour tore up our deterrents before they were even in place, and the results are there in black and white.

""When I went to the Channel to see Labour's France returns deal in action, the truth was obvious. Within half an hour of arriving off the French coast, I watched two packed dinghies being escorted into UK waters. Every illegal migrant should be removed immediately upon arrival.""

A Labour source said: ""When Chris Philp became immigration minister in February 2020, only 2,400 people had crossed the Channel in small boats, and there were just 10 asylum hotels in operation.

""By the time he left that job 19 months later, 25,500 people had crossed the Channel and there were 149 asylum hotels in place. This crisis exploded under his watch, yet he now has the brass neck to act as though he is just learning about it for the first time.""

Louise Calvey, head of the Asylum Matters charity, has said the government's 'one-in, one-out' deal with France was ""yet another attack on the human right to seek sanctuary"".

""In reinforcing the criminalisation of people exercising their legal right to seek asylum, our government continues to ignore the Refugee Convention – which permits travel by irregular means to seek sanctuary – and punish people for using the only means available to them to reach safety.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/86a5/live/aa2be660-783c-11f0-aa29-15a69a839271.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 14:57:43.412719

“ICE’s tactic of snatching people in and around state courts was unjust and instilled fear in so many people.","By Ryan Schwach

A group of public defender organizations and immigration nonprofits are calling on a federal court to dismiss the Trump administration’s lawsuit challenging a New York State law that protects immigrants when they appear in court.

The organizations said in a brief filed in federal court on Monday that the state’s Protect Our Courts Act safeguards the rights of immigrants attending court hearings. They argued that eliminating it would only strengthen President Donald Trump's deportation efforts and further endanger local immigrant communities.

The Protect Our Courts Act protects immigrants from civil arrests in and around New York State courts and when traveling to and from state courthouses, absent a judicial warrant or court order.

The ongoing suit from Trump’s Department of Justice continues as Trump exerts federal authority in the nation’s capitol and threatens to expand it to cities like New York.

“Immigrants make up an important part of New York’s social fabric, and laws that ensure that they have full access to state services and functions advance public policy goals unrelated to immigration and benefit the entire state,” the brief, filed by the Legal Aid Society, Make the Road New York, Brooklyn Defender Services and a handful of other organizations said.

In June, the Trump administration announced its suit against POCA, as well as two Governor Andrew Cuomo-era executive orders which further prevent civil immigration arrests at other state facilities and deter government employees from sharing information with the federal government.

The federal lawsuit alleges that the laws create “intolerable obstacles,” to Trump’s heavy-handed federal immigration enforcement, which has recently targeted migrants attending mandatory and routine court hearings for arrest, including in New York.

Separately, the Trump DOJ has also targeted New York City over its sanctuary city laws on similar grounds. That lawsuit remains ongoing.

“Through these enactments, New York obstructs federal law enforcement and facilitates the evasion of federal law by dangerous criminals, notwithstanding federal agents’ statutory mandate to detain and remove illegal aliens,” the lawsuit reads.

While most of the enforcement has been carried out at federal courts like the one at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, deportation arrests have been made at state courts as well. The Trump administration appears to want to increase those arrests.

According to the data obtained by the Immigrant Defense Project through a Freedom of Information Law request, ICE officers have entered state courthouses more than 30 times this year, resulting in four arrests – all made with warrants.

During a budget hearing in February, Chief Administrative Judge Joseph Zayas said court brass had met with ICE officials to discuss their protocols and highlight the protections of the Protect Our Courts Act.

“I certainly appreciate that we have the Protect Our Courts Act, and that we were prescient enough to see the need for that,” Zayas at the time. “I understand that in some of the meetings that our folks have had with regional ICE officials, that they are aware of that act, as well.”

Zayas said that the protocols were communicated to judges and court employees.

“We’re prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure that the [Protect Our Courts Act] is followed,” he said.

During the hearing, Zayas said he was aware of attempts by ICE to enter courthouses, but to his knowledge, they had only done so with a judicial warrant, which is in line with state law.

“We haven’t had any indication that the ICE officers have done anything other than follow our procedure,” he said. “As soon as these folks come to our courthouse, they are directed to a designated judge who reviews the purported warrant or detainer to determine whether it is a judicial warrant.”

The Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit when it began in June.

The Legal Aid Society, along with the other organizations, are seeking to get the POCA suit – which is in the United States Northern District of New York – entirely dismissed.

“New York has a constitutional duty to ensure equal access to justice, and to benefits and services, for all New Yorkers — regardless of immigration status — and that principle was at the heart of both POCA and these executive orders,” said Meghna Philip, director of the special litigation unit at the Legal Aid Society. “The second Trump administration has openly targeted sanctuary jurisdictions. This lawsuit is another example of that political attack, and it should be dismissed.”

POCA came about in 2020 when the Trump administration increased arrests by ICE agents in state courts.

The bill’s text said that the trend had a “damaging impact on all New Yorkers, not just immigrant communities, as the operation of our judicial system and public safety are undermined.”

Monday’s brief said that the broader legal community supported POCA because “civil arrests in or near courthouses undermine the integrity of New York’s justice system.”

“These laws were enacted during the first Trump Administration in direct response to ICE’s predatory presence at New York state courthouses and other state facilities, which spread fear, and denied New Yorkers’ access to the courts, and to state programs, benefits, and services,” said Philip.

Immigration rights groups included in the brief said that protecting immigrants’ ability to access the courts is crucial to protecting their overall rights.

“In our state courts, the stakes are high – judges are determining whether to deprive community members of their liberty, separate them from their families, or strip them of their livelihoods,” said Executive Director of the Immigrant Defense Project Yasmine Farhang. “ICE’s tactic of snatching people in and around state courts was unjust and instilled fear in so many people. The Protect Our Courts Act changed the landscape for the better and we strongly join the call to urge this lawsuit be dismissed.”

Should the Trump administration win its suit, it would likely mean a further crackdown of immigrants within courthouses, which is already happening en masse in federal courthouses.

Last week, the NYCLU sued the Trump administration over its treatment of detained immigrants at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE has held people in a makeshift detention center.

The lawsuit claims detainees are held often for days on end without access to showers, clean clothes or an attorney.

Late Tuesday, a federal judge granted the NYCLU a temporary restraining order in the case, preventing ICE from holding people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order would also require ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats, provide access to medical care, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained, according to the NYCLU.

“Today’s order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project. ""We’ll continue to fight to ensure that peoples’ rights are upheld at 26 Federal Plaza and beyond.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b9ffe0f1137a680c2c08250/5ba02661cd8366eb6ec50772/689cb08fea3e815db0867270/1755099441693/POCA+1.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-08-13 12:59:06.611854

They’ve already passed laws restricting local cooperation with ICE, outlawing 287(g) in all counties.
Local officials can also do their part to reject 287(g) agreements, prioritizing community safety over deportation quotas.","This spring, a 19-year old university student named Ximena Arias-Cristobal was sent to an immigrant detention center in Dalton, Georgia for an alleged traffic violation. The traffic charges were eventually dropped, but it was too late. Authorities in Dalton had already called ICE under a federal program that turns police encounters into deportation pipelines.

With her final exams approaching and her family’s future depending on her academic success, Ximena was detained in a privately run detention center notorious for inhumane conditions and severe rights violations.

Unfortunately, her story is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a broader reality across the country as local police departments become extensions of federal immigration enforcement through what are called 287(g) agreements.

That refers to Section 287(g) of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The program authorizes ICE to train and deputize state and local law enforcement to carry out immigration duties, effectively turning police officers into ICE agents while conducting their routine police work.

287(g) perpetuates racial profiling and other civil and human rights abuses. But the Trump administration is leading a big push to expand the program. Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, there’s been a 566 percent increase in 287(g) agreements, with 765 new agreements signed nationwide as of mid August.

These agreements are generally limited to certain cities, counties, or state agencies. But states like Florida and Georgia have passed laws requiring all counties in their states to participate in 287(g). Florida Governor Ron DeSantis even pushed universities to sign agreements that turn college campuses into targets of mass deportation. Apparently no space is safe for immigrant communities.

This program is eroding public safety and trust in law enforcement. When people fear that dialing 911 could result in the deportation of themselves or a loved one, crimes go unreported, victims stay silent, and witnesses refuse to cooperate with criminal investigations.

A 2018 study by the Cato Institute found no evidence that these partnerships with ICE decreased crime rates. They simply made communities less safe for everyone.

Expanding 287(g) agreements normalizes racial profiling and discrimination. That led President Obama to scale back the program in 2012 after repeated instances of constitutional abuses in Maricopa County, Arizona, yet it’s been resurrected under Trump and is now growing exponentially.

And so are the abuses.

Jose Alvaro was buying baby formula when he was arrested in Lubbock, Texas after police pulled him over for a license plate issue and called ICE. Despite having no criminal record, Alvaro was kept in immigration detention, leaving his wife and three children alone.

Despite the administration’s claim that it’s focusing on deporting “criminals,” stories like Jose’s Ximena’s are no exception. In one recent study, 71.5 percent of the 57,000 immigrants in ICE custody had no criminal convictions.

It’s clear these agreements are making our communities less safe. But other states are fighting back. California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, New Jersey, and Colorado provide blueprints for resisting this program statewide. They’ve already passed laws restricting local cooperation with ICE, outlawing 287(g) in all counties.

Other state lawmakers must follow their lead and refuse to turn their communities into hunting grounds for vile immigration policies. Local officials can also do their part to reject 287(g) agreements, prioritizing community safety over deportation quotas.

We can also pressure universities and institutions to reject pressure to implement these agreements. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC.org) provides a toolkit to mobilize against expanding ICE authority and a map of agreements across the country.

The project was developed and led by retired financial executive and immigration advocate Tom Cartwright for nearly six years. Human Rights First will continue Tom’s critical work under a new name: the ICE Flight Monitor.

Between 2020 and 2025, Tom Cartwright tracked over 40,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flights, providing an unprecedented window into the hidden operations of the U.S. immigration enforcement system.

Cartwright’s journey is both unlikely and inspiring: a financial executive who, in retirement, transformed into a leading expert on immigration enforcement flights. Driven by a profound commitment to justice and accountability, he applied his data and analytical expertise from the financial sector to expose the vast, opaque scale of ICE flights. His volunteer work has become an indispensable tool, informing litigation, shaping congressional oversight, and galvanizing public awareness around immigration enforcement practices.

“Tom Cartwright has demonstrated extraordinary innovation and dedication in building this initiative from the ground up, and we are honored to carry his work forward,” said Uzra Zeya, CEO and President of Human Rights First. “His work brings essential transparency to U.S. government actions impacting thousands of lives and stands as a powerful example of citizen-driven accountability in defense of human rights and democracy.”

“It’s been my honor and privilege to virtually accompany and acknowledge the dignity of nearly 800,000 people deported—and millions moved between detention centers—under ICE Air’s covert and opaque process. This work has always been about bringing transparency to a system designed to operate in the shadows. I am so thankful that the dedicated team at Human Rights First will not only continue this work but expand and elevate it to a higher level,” said Tom Cartwright.

In the wake of the Southport killings, government officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech as to the identity and motives of the attacker,” the report said.
While the UK maintains it is striking a balance between protecting speech and keeping citizens safe, Vance claims the UK has got that balance wrong.","The Trump administration has published a report claiming that human rights in the United Kingdom “worsened” over the past year.

The annual report, part of the US State Department’s global survey of human rights and covers the 2024 calendar year, criticized what it said were “serious restrictions” on free speech and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.

Although other reports in the series claimed human rights also regressed in countries like France and Germany, the list of grievances in the UK was far longer, underscoring the supposed backsliding in the age of social media.

Specifically on freedom of speech in the UK, the US report said that “the government generally respected this right” but that “there were specific areas of concern, including involving restrictions on political speech deemed ‘hateful’ or ‘offensive.’”

A UK government spokesperson said that free speech is “vital for democracy,” and that “we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.”

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in February, Vice President JD Vance – who is currently on vacation in England’s rural Cotswolds – claimed that free speech across Europe is “in retreat” and singled out Britain as the country where the “basic liberties” of citizens had been caught “in the crosshairs.”

The report singled out the response by what was then the young government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the murder of three schoolgirls by Axel Rudakubana, the British son of Rwandan migrants, in the northern English town of Southport last year.

The murders – and misinformation about the identity of the perpetrator – sparked anti-immigration riots across the country, prompting some to set fire to a hotel used to house asylum seekers while people were inside.

In the wake of the Southport killings, government officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech as to the identity and motives of the attacker,” the report said.

Although the report implied nefariousness on the part of the British government, prosecutors applied existing laws, such as the Public Order Act 1986 and the Communications Act 2003, to punish speech deemed “indecent or grossly offensive.”

To stem the rioting, Starmer – a former director of public prosecutions – pledged that those involved would face the “full force of the law.” That summer, nearly 2,000 people were arrested and more than 1,000 people were charged.

Although the riots swiftly died down after the initial spasm of outrage, many on the British right criticized the government’s response as heavy-handed, designed to throttle conservative views.

“While many media observers deemed ‘two-tier’ enforcement of these laws following the Southport attacks an especially grievous example of government censorship, censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech,” the report said.

It cited the sentencing in July of Lee Joseph Dunn to eight weeks in prison for “posting a meme suggesting a link between migrants and knife crime.” Dunn pleaded guilty to sending messages that were “grossly offensive,” which prosecutors said risked “worsening community tensions.”

Dunn’s case was not unusual. In another high-profile instance, Lucy Connolly, a mother and former nanny, was sentenced to 31 months in prison after calling for mass deportation and urging hotels housing immigrants to be set on fire. “If that makes me racist so be it,” she posted on X at the time.

While the UK maintains it is striking a balance between protecting speech and keeping citizens safe, Vance claims the UK has got that balance wrong. During a meeting last week with UK Foreign Minister David Lammy, the vice president said he did not want other countries to “follow us down what I think was a very dark path under the Biden administration” by censoring conservative views.

Following Vance’s Munich speech, and his more recent interventions, many in Britain have accused him of hypocrisy and cited the Trump administration’s detention of students over pro-Palestinian speech and taking legal action against broadcasters for what it deems hostile news coverage.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/shutterstock-editorial-15417695c.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-13 12:58:36.712491

Unlike federal district court judges, immigration court judges operate under the direction of the attorney general’s office.","A federal judge in New York has ordered Donald Trump’s administration to improve conditions inside a makeshift detention center in downtown Manhattan, where detainees reported little access to food and water, sleeping on cement floors and not having anywhere to bathe for days or weeks at a time.

The order from District Judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday arrived just hours after Department of Justice lawyers admitted that immigrants inside the holding facility don’t have access to medication and aren’t allowed to meet with lawyers in person.

A lawsuit from civil rights groups includes several grim accounts from inside the facility on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, including allegations that a 20-year-old detainee was forced to wear blood-soaked clothing after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents didn’t provide her with a pad.

In court filings, detainees said they were fed inedible “slop” and were forced to sleep in cells surrounded by the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces in rooms with open toilets.

Other detainees reported spending as much as three weeks inside the facility without a chance to bathe or brush their teeth. Another man said he watched a detainee have a seizure for 30 minutes before medical help arrived.

Kaplan ordered ICE to improve detainees’ access to personal hygiene products and medical care, as well as free, unmonitored and confidential calls with lawyers within 24 hours after they are detained.

Cells must also be cleaned three times a day, according to the order.

The order also prohibits people from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person, which shrinks the capacity of the largest hold room to roughly a dozen or so people.

Tuesday’s order “sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” according to Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, among groups that sued the administration over conditions at the facility.

In a statement shared with The Independent, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the judge’s order and lawsuit “are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza.”

“The fact of the matter here is the Trump administration is carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history and is removing the worst of the worst from American communities,” she added. “Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. 26 Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.”

Homeland Security intends to appeal Kaplan’s order.

In court filings, Hugo Elias Sanchez Trillos described spending nearly three weeks inside that facility, with a three-day break in between when he was transferred to Nassau County jail.

“I was in the same clothes for 19 days, without ever having an opportunity to bathe,” he wrote.

The room “smelled terrible because no one had bathed,” according to Joselyn Chipantiza Sisalema. “There was no bathroom paper, and the guards would throw only a few paper napkins into our room,” she wrote.

Detainees were served food only twice a day, around 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., and “we got water only when the guards felt like it,” Sanchez Trillos wrote.

“The food was processed and awful; it was difficult to eat. It came inside plastic bags that were usually cold,” he said. “The guards would eat their own food in front of us, things like pizza and hamburgers. … We were so hungry and it felt [like] they were jeering at us.”

Videos from inside the facility show roughly two dozen people crammed in, lying on a cement floor with nothing but emergency blankets and thin sheets, steps away from a toilet separated only by a waist-high partition.

“Look how they have us like dogs in here,” the person filming the videos can be heard saying in Spanish.

Footage obtained by the New York Immigration Coalition provides outsiders with a first glimpse of the room, which federal officials have prevented members of Congress from observing.

In the clips, the men inside are seated on benches that line the walls or are lying on aluminum emergency blankets on the bare floor. Two toilets in the room, one of which appears to be covered by tinfoil, are blocked off by a small partition. No doors separate the toilets from the rest of the room.

Following Tuesday’s order, the “shadow 10th floor detention center must be shut down permanently,” coalition president Murad Awawdeh said in a statement.

Immigrants’ rights groups, lawyers and lawmakers have warned for weeks about deteriorating conditions inside the building, which also houses immigration courts. Federal law enforcement officers have been stationed in the building’s hallways since at least May 20 to make arrests moments after immigrants appear in court.

The “hold room” is not intended to hold people for longer than 12 hours, according to ICE’s internal guidance. In May and June, when arrests at immigration check-ins and courthouses began to skyrocket, immigrants were being held inside the room for 29 hours on average, according to a review from New York City news outlet The City. Within those two months, 81 people were detained there for four days or more at a time.

Detentions peaked on June 5, when 186 people were held there overnight, The City found.

Thousands of people across the country have faced arrest after showing up for court-ordered ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Unlike federal district court judges, immigration court judges operate under the direction of the attorney general’s office.

The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review has issued guidance to judges to grant motions from government lawyers to immediately dismiss immigrants’ cases, making them easy targets for arrest and removal.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/12/21/40/federal-plaza-detention.png?trim=18,0,64,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-08-13 12:58:42.760117

She was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and put into an unmarked black van by masked federal agents.

The arrest put a spotlight on the risks faced by a growing number of volunteers who work to document immigration enforcement actions across Southern California.

Trebach is a member of Unión del Barrio, an immigrant rights organization, one of several advocacy groups that conduct local patrols to respond to and document immigration enforcement operations in Southern California.

For the last several months, the registered nurse, alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, has volunteered her free time to help document masked federal immigration officials coming into and out of Terminal Island, which is being used as a staging area for immigration enforcement operations.

The Department of Homeland Security blamed Trebach for inciting her own arrest, saying in a statement that she “jumped in front of moving vehicles, causing [Border Patrol agents] to swerve out of the way.”

Trebach allegedly “continued to hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents. After vehicles evaded her, she again physically blocked and impeded CBP from completing their duties.”

Federal agents arrested her on suspicion of impeding and obstructing federal law enforcement. However, Trebach was released from the federal detention center in Los Angeles on Saturday night without criminal charges, according to National Nurses United, a union and professional association of registered nurses.

Immigrant advocates alleged Trebach was targeted for her political activism. On the morning of her arrest, Trebach’s supporters say, federal agents swerved their vehicle toward the group of advocates and Trebach dropped her sign, which possibly hit the vehicle.

Despite the risks, immigrant advocacy groups say they have seen a growing interest among community members to get on the front lines to document immigration arrests.

The Community Self Defense Coalition, an immigrant advocacy organization made up of about 80 subgroups across Los Angeles County, has been getting calls from concerned residents asking for resources for their neighbors and wanting guidance on how to create their own supportive network, including local patrols.

Advocates say the best way to get involved is to volunteer with a local group that can train and prepare you for patrols and documenting enforcement operations.

“We must do so, however, in a way that keeps us safe, that doesn’t jeopardize our security and our constitutional rights because the times in which we’re living are just a bit too aggressive,” said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights.

What are your rights when documenting immigration enforcement actions?

You have the 1st Amendment right to observe, take photographs and record video of immigration enforcement in public places, which includes streets and sidewalks, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, and Witness, a nonprofit that advocates for the documentation of human rights violations.

“Do so in a way that you know ensures both your safety and ensures that you also are not getting involved in the [enforcement] actions whereby you can be charged with interference,” Cabrera said.

Immigration enforcement officials can arrest you for interfering or obstructing an operation if they believe you are getting between a federal officer and the person they’re arresting.

In this environment, whether you’ve been alerted to an arrest taking place or have stumbled into one as a bystander, advocates say an operation can happen quickly and the situation can escalate.

If you decide to document, you should consider “how ICE prioritizes their own safety and their potential aggressive response to your presence,” according to Witness.

You also should consider how to document someone who is being detained.

Advocates have mixed feelings about recording or taking photos that identify a person being arrested.

Some recommend that you try to avoid exposing the arrested person’s identity, instead focusing on recording law enforcement officials.

However, other organizations, such as Instituto de Educacion Popular del Sur de California (IDEPSCA), will temporarily post a screenshot of those who have been arrested on its Instagram account to help identify the arrested person and notify their family.

How can you safely document an arrest?

If you encounter an arrest or enforcement operation, Manuel Vicente, director of radio station and immigrant rights group Radio Jornalera, suggests the following safety tips before you hit the record button or snap a photo:

Remain calm.

Keep a safe distance from immigration enforcement officers and the person who is being arrested.

Do not interfere with immigration enforcement operations.

Narrate factual context such as location, date, time, number of immigration officials, badge numbers, whether the officers are on foot or in vehicles, whether the officers are carrying any weapons.

If an immigration official tells you to back away, comply and record yourself doing so (for example, point the camera toward your feet to show you are moving backward).

Don’t post the video to social media. Instead, share it with a local advocacy group or rapid response network so they can verify the documented information.

Either during or after the incident, call your local rapid response network to notify and share any documentation with them.

New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry said they are in contact with Ms Shaw but did not comment further.","A woman from New Zealand who was detained by US immigration with her young son at the US-Canada border feared she was being kidnapped.

Sarah Shaw, 33, and her six year-old were detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on 24 July when she drove her two eldest children to Vancouver airport in British Columbia for a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents on a holiday.

However, the mother and son were detained when they tried to cross the border to re-enter the US, where she was staying for over three years and is working as a youth counsellor at a juvenile detention facility in Washington.

“They are confined in horrible, isolated conditions with extremely limited access to communicate with legal counsel and bordering abuse,” her friend Victoria Besancon, who is trying to raise money to secure her release, said.

She said Ms Shaw initially thought she was being kidnapped as they were bundled into a white van with no markings at the Canadian border.

""I remember her on the phone being absolutely panicked. She originally thought she was being kidnapped, she didn't even realise she was being detained originally,” Ms Besancon told RNZ.

""They were put into a giant white van, there were no markers on it, and not a lot was explained to them, so she was absolutely terrified.""

She claims Ms Shaw has not been given formal charge paperwork, has not been added to ICE’s detainee locator system, and has been denied the chance to present evidence of her legal status.

She said her friend has been forced to spend what little commissary funds she has on basic items such as toothbrushes and shampoo for her son.

""She is in a locked room with five bunk beds, she's allowed to walk around the facility from 8am to 8pm, but outside of that she is locked in a cell with other families.""

Aside from the staff, she and her son are the only English speakers, calling it “kind of like being in jail”.

Ms Shaw is among the many foreign nationals who have ended up in detention centres as part of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown on immigrants. Centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi have been dubbed Detention Alley.

Ms Shaw’s lawyer, Minda Thorward, told local media she had a temporary immigration document which made her eligible for re-entry into the US, but there was an “administrative error” with it.

The Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE), representing Ms Shaw, has demanded her release.

“The trauma this has already caused for her and her son may never be healed,” said Mike Yestramski, the union’s president, who also works as a psychiatric social worker at Western State hospital.

He said the union “vehemently opposes ICE practices” and Mr Trump’s immigration policies.

New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry said they are in contact with Ms Shaw but did not comment further.

In July, Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border tracked 207 deportation flights to several dozen countries, but 727 domestic “shuffle flights” of ICE detainees being moved within the US — the highest number since he began tracking flights in 2020, he said.
Today, the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based CSI Aviation is the largest private contractor for ICE Air.","Amid the hubbub of passengers and planes shuttling in and out of the international airport in Richmond, Virginia, each week there’s also a steady stream of flights bearing men and women in handcuffs.

Last week, CNN was there to see some of these passengers — detainees in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — being unloaded from unmarked white vans, lined up under the wing of a Boeing 737. One by one, some 50 detainees were told to board the aircraft.

According to data from immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border, Richmond is one of about 70 domestic hubs that the Trump administration has used as stoppage points for ICE flights that shuttle detainees in its custody between detention centers around the country, with the goal of eventually deporting them.

As President Donald Trump moves to remove as many as 1 million immigrants a year from the US, putting more detainees on more airplanes, and with more frequency, has become a key feature of carrying out that endeavor.

Though flights have been a part of US immigration operations for years, the speed and scale of the ICE program today is unprecedented. Since Trump’s inauguration, there have been more than 1,000 deportation flights to other countries, up 15% over the January to July period last year, according to Witness at the Border.

The flights are operated by a mix of private charter companies and at least one commercial airline, who are subcontractors to ICE, with a smaller portion carried out by military aircrafts.

But recently, experts have noticed a new trend.

Beginning in March, major companies operating the flights began requesting that their tail numbers — identifiers for planes akin to license plates on cars — be removed from public flight-tracking websites, according to Ian Petchenik of Flightradar24, one such website.

These websites provide real-time tracking of flights, displaying their positions, routes and other relevant data. They help consumers track flight delays, but are also a notable tool for public accountability.

The move to block tail numbers became possible after the Federal Aviation Administration last year broadened its rules to allow companies the ability to request their information be removed by filling out a form online.

This means that even as more flights are carrying ICE detainees, they have become much harder to track, raising accountability concerns.

“This is vital information to be able to understand how ICE is conducting its enforcement and deportation activities,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel for the ACLU National Prison Project. “Sometimes this is the only information that the public has with respect to where ICE is placing people because of a general lack of transparency around detention and deportation under this particular administration.”

These changes have made it far harder for relatives of those detained and transported by ICE to find their loved ones, according to Guadalupe Gonzalez, a spokesperson for La Resistencia, an immigration advocacy group. “Families can’t track where their loved ones are being sent, they’re just being disappeared.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not return CNN’s request for comment to clarify whether the agency had requested the tail numbers be hidden and why.

A spokesperson for Avelo Airlines, a commercial airline that has devoted three of its aircraft to ICE flights, told CNN in an email: “Flights operated on behalf of the United States government are often unidentified at the government’s request. As subcontractors to the United States government, we ask that you direct your questions to them.”

GlobalX Airlines, a charter company, told CNN in an email that it “is not authorized to comment on matters related to the ICE contract,” and referred CNN to ICE. Eastern Air Express, another major charter flight provider, did not respond to a request for comment.

Where does ICE fly?

Immigration flights have taken place under Democratic as well as Republican administrations in the past, but the increase is notable in its expansiveness as well as volume.

Besides the increase in deportation flights, there has been an even bigger rise in flights transporting detainees between airports within the US, according to Witness at the Border. These trips move detainees between detention facilities, as more ICE arrests means those in custody are being shuffled between sites around the country in a complex, coordinated scramble to find available beds.

In July, Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border tracked 207 deportation flights to several dozen countries, but 727 domestic “shuffle flights” of ICE detainees being moved within the US — the highest number since he began tracking flights in 2020, he said.

A booming business

A vast network of private firms operates the flights, and the industry around them, from refueling to security.

Today, the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based CSI Aviation is the largest private contractor for ICE Air. It does not operate flights directly but rather acts as the federal government’s main broker for subcontracting flights and flight-related operations.

In February 2025, CSI Aviation won an award of $128 million as the prime contractor for ICE flight operations. The contract is now worth more than $321 million.

The company works with subcontractors that operate the flights. Among the top subcontractors for flights in July were GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo Airlines, according to data from Witness at the Border.

Leaders at firms involved in the administration’s deportation operation have strongly backed Trump and his party.

CSI Aviation CEO Allen Weh is a GOP donor who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the party and its candidates. The company hosted a Trump campaign rally at one of its hangars in Albuquerque in October 2024. Eastern Air Express, which Witness at the Border observed operating 24% of ICE flights in July, also owned and operated a 737 used for the Trump/Vance campaign.

A question of transparency

Last month, La Resistencia, which has been tracking ICE flights on the US West Coast, noted in a report on these activities that in addition to masking their tail numbers, flights are also changing their air traffic call signs.

An air traffic call sign is an identifier a flight uses to communicate with air traffic controllers and usually contains some indication of the flight’s operator.

The air traffic call sign now being used by most of these ICE flights is “Tyson ”— the same call sign Trump used for his personal plane after he was elected in 2016.

La Resistencia said in its report: “We have witnessed extensive efforts on behalf of ICE air contractors to make their immigration work as hard to observe as possible.”

Gonzalez, the La Resistencia spokesperson, said: “Our biggest concern is transparency. If we can’t observe how humans are being treated, we are worried human rights will be violated.”

From New York to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions – are being held.
Ten immigration detainees have died in federal custody so far this year, compared to 11 deaths in all of 2024.
McLaughlin called claims of overcrowding and poor conditions at Ice detention centers “categorically false”.
He brought a copy of the law that affirms members’ oversight rights and asked to speak with senior officials on site.","The Arizona representative Yassamin Ansari toured a detention facility in May where immigrants rounded up as part of the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportation were being housed. She described what she saw inside as “sickening” and “worse than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in overcrowded, moldy cells and many reported that they did not have reliable access to food, water or medical care.

Two months later, Ansari returned to the remote desert complex to conduct another congressional oversight visit. This time, she was denied entry.

It wasn’t an isolated incident. From New York to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions – are being held.

Democratic officials’ legislative checks – a legal right for members of Congress – have consistently confirmed reports that immigrant detainees are being kept in “filthy” and “inhumane” conditions with little regard for due process. Now, the facilities have become a battleground in the intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers over the president’s supercharged immigration agenda.

“The administration’s goal is to intimidate us and bully us, bully us out of doing our jobs for sure,” Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who has been accused of assaulting federal agents during a confrontation at the Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If they can get away with doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to anyone. But more importantly, imagine what they’re doing in the dark to others who are not of an elected status, who are not in public eye view.”

McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month later, detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory wall – an act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and overcrowding.

Republicans accuse Democrats of failing to follow protocol, and say their unannounced visits are more political grandstanding than genuine congressional oversight. But Democrats counter that it is their responsibility to shed light on the most hidden aspects of Trump’s deportation agenda, which has ensnared Daca recipients, legal residents and even US citizens.

A report released last week by Democratic senator Jon Ossoff’s office, compiled in part from site visits, found widespread human rights abuses in immigrant detention centers, including the mistreatment of pregnant women and children. “Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,” the report noted. The DHS sought to debunk the report, calling its allegations “garbage” and saying Ossoff and his staff have never been denied oversight visits.

Last month, a dozen Democratic members of Congress filed suit over a Trump-era DHS policy requiring members of Congress and their staff to provide a week’s notice before any requested visit. They say the requirement is more than red tape – it is unconstitutional. The rule, the lawmakers argue in their suit, unlawfully restricts their oversight authority and prevents a co-equal branch of government from doing its job.

Under a provision of federal law that funds Ice, the government may not prevent a member of Congress “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens”. Requiring advance notice, Democrats say, gives the administration time to create a misleading picture of daily operations.

“This is kind of like general oversight 101,” Colorado representative Jason Crow, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs, told the Guardian. “You announce a visit, and they roll out what they want you to see, and things are dressed up and cleaned up.”

Crow has conducted site inspections at immigration detention sites in his district since 2019 – and he helped pass the law that solidified Congress’s right to make unannounced inspections. In July, he was blocked from entering a center in Aurora.

Similar confrontations are playing out nationwide. On Wednesday, a delegation of Democratic representatives from New York, including the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Adriano Espaillat, were turned away from a center in Brooklyn now housing detained immigrants under a new agreement with the Bureau of Prisons.

“This blatant lack of respect towards the legislative branch is a deterioration of checks and balances,” Espaillat said after the encounter. “All while they hide their atrocities from the public.”

In a response posted on X, the DHS called the lawmakers’ efforts “deeply unserious”. “These members did not follow proper protocol and schedule their visit. Instead they brought a gaggle of media to drive clicks and fundraising emails,” the department said.

In a statement, department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Ice had imposed the new visitation policy to protect the president’s constitutional authority to carry out immigration enforcement and protect agency personnel from “a surge in assaults, disruptions, and obstructions to enforcement – including by member of Congress themselves”.

“A week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority,” she said.

As relatives and lawyers struggle to locate and contact people in Ice custody, advocates say congressional visits are essential to building a public record of conditions inside facilities that operate far from public view.

“We are not talking about a mistake here and there,” said Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS. “We’re talking about a pattern of abuse that is happening in multiple communities, and bearing witness to that, and building that record so that members who may want to … are not able to say that this is happenstance or anecdotal.”

Ice arrests and detentions rose sharply in the first six months after Trump returned to the White House. In Democratic-leaning states masked Ice agents are frequently arresting immigrants at worksites, in the streets and in mass roundups – aggressive tactics that triggered protests in cities such as Los Angeles. Their targets are increasingly people with no criminal records at all.

As arrests soar to record numbers, the nation’s immigration detention system – a patchwork of government-run and private facilities – is buckling under the strain. By late June, it was over capacity by more than 13,500 people, according to a Guardian analysis of public data from the Deportation Data Project. Ten immigration detainees have died in federal custody so far this year, compared to 11 deaths in all of 2024.

McLaughlin called claims of overcrowding and poor conditions at Ice detention centers “categorically false”. The agency, she added, has “worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space” to accommodate the Trump administration’s mass arrest and incarceration operation.

The scramble to create more detention beds has seen the agency sign new contracts with private prisons companies, as well as federal and state prisons. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, recently touted plans to open a detention center in Indiana it calls the “Speedway Slammer”, following the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz”, a facility built in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Last week, the Pentagon said Fort Bliss, an army base in Texas, was prepared to accept as many as 1,000 immigrant detainees by the end of the month.

On Tuesday, the Trump administration was ordered to improve conditions inside an immigration holding facility in New York City, after advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of detainees who described being kept in unsanitary and overcrowded cells, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products.

Shortly after immigration raids swept Los Angeles in June, triggering days of tense protests, Congresswoman Judy Chu of California said her office began receiving urgent requests from advocates and worried family members asking for help locating people believed to be held at a center in the remote desert town of Adelanto.

Chu had visited the facility several times during her years in office. But on 8 June, guards scrambled to lock the fence when she arrived with California congressmen Gil Cisneros and Derek Tran, she recounted. The trio shouted their names and held up signs identifying themselves as members of Congress – but they were turned away.

“It was illegal, of course, because we have this right to go in,” Chu said in an interview.

More than a week later, Chu and a larger delegation of California Democrats were granted access to the facility and were able to meet with people detained during the raids, including a Daca recipient. Some said they had gone days without a change of clothes and were, in many cases, unable to call their families or legal representatives.

“We must keep on trying, because otherwise we don’t know what will happen to these detainees,” Chu said, vowing to push for more access. “The less attention that is being given through our oversight inspections, the more [DHS] thinks it can get away with the worst conditions possible.”

Congressman Jay Obernolte, a Republican of California, came away with a different impression when he toured the Adelanto facility in July, days after Trump deployed the national guard and active duty marines to quell the immigration protests that had erupted across Los Angeles. In a statement, he said that those in custody at the facility have “access to medical care, legal counsel, meals, and the full rights guaranteed under federal law”.

“Facilities like Adelanto exist to help Ice enforce our immigration laws and keep our communities safe,” he said. “The vast majority of detainees housed here have committed serious crimes in addition to being present in our country illegally. They are being processed quickly, fairly, and humanely.”

In a statement,​ a spokesman​ for the private prison firm GEO Group said that​ the detention facilities it operates, like Adelanto in California and elsewhere across the country, provide “around-the-clock access to medical care​” as well as “in-person and virtual​ legal and family visitation” in addition to other services. ​The detention centers adhered to strict federal detention standards on safety, food and medical care in addition to the facility’s capacity, the spokesman said, stating: “Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.​”

As Democratic officials continue to face barriers, they have started sharing best practices for securing access.

Before visiting a facility in Eloy, Arizona, to check on a local restaurant owner held there in Ice custody, Congressman Greg Stanton consulted another member of Congress for advice. He brought a copy of the law that affirms members’ oversight rights and asked to speak with senior officials on site.

Still, he was refused entry.

“I think others feel the same way I do, which is, you don’t get to pick and choose which laws you follow,” Stanton said. “And it may be inconvenient to have a member of Congress show up and try to do their duty of oversight, but that doesn’t matter. This is what the law says, and you’ve got to follow the law.”

Brian Todd, a spokesman for the private prison contractor CoreCivic, which operates the Eloy Detention Center, said that while the company endeavors to be “as accommodating and transparent as possible,” all congressional visits must be coordinated through Ice’s office of congressional relations. He also said that the facilities were closely monitored by federal observers to ensure compliance and said claims of poor food or water quality at the center were “patently false”.

“We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people,” Todd said, “but the fact is we operate safe, secure facilities that provide high quality services for our government partners at Ice”.

Crow, the Colorado congressman, began inspections of a privately operated immigration facility outside Denver in 2019, following repeated community reports about poor conditions, disease outbreaks, access to medical care and poor food storage.

“I represent a lot of immigrants and refugees, and frequently we’re dealing with their families or with constituents and checking on individual conditions or access to counsel for residents of our district,” he said.

At first, access was limited – prompting his push to strengthen protections for members of Congress. He eventually created a toolkit complete with a template for oversight visits, which he now shares with other members of Congress.

“There are egregious abuses occurring on a daily basis around the country, everything from unmarked vans with masked agents jumping out and grabbing people … to the lack of access to legal counsel and a variety of abuses,” he said. “So that’s what we’re worried about. And clearly this administration wants to hide their activities.”

McIver, whose charges stem from an attempt to shield Newark mayor Ras Baraka from arrest during a protest at the facility, said she still has a right to conduct oversight visits – she remains a member of Congress and serves on a homeland security committee. But with a serious legal case pending, she has opted not to return – for now.

“They’re using me as an example to try to be as cruel as possible to me and humiliate me and intimidate me, hoping that that will carry over to other people,” she said.

Despite the risks, other Democratic members of Congress are still showing up – even when doors are slammed in their faces – because, as McIver put it, “it’s their job”.

His small law office in New England currently handles 5,000 immigration cases, many of them assigned to the Chelmsford Immigration Court, just outside Boston.

But on a recent Wednesday afternoon, seven of nine appointments were rescheduled.

The next day, two out of three were pushed.

And the following day, four out of six got delayed.

""The court is not functioning,"" Born said. He said some of his clients have waited more than a decade for their court hearings.

""Now that's being taken away. So the little light at the end of the tunnel for these people who have been following the American dream and playing by all the rules is increasingly being snuffed.""

The Chelmsford Immigration Court opened last year as a way to reduce the backlog on the overloaded Boston court, which used to process immigration cases for much of New England. Chelmsford and Boston are now the only courts located in New England, two of about 70 immigration courts and adjudication centers nationwide.

Eight months into the Trump administration, there are only seven judges listed on the court's website, down from the 21 intended to serve. One of those seven is set to retire in the coming days, NPR has learned. Another has been detailed to review cases in Indianapolis.

NPR spoke with nearly a dozen of the judges assigned to work at the Chelmsford Immigration Court who are no longer there. All attest to a clear pattern: judges vacating their benches, increased political pressure and a growing dread of not knowing if their jobs are safe.

The Chelmsford court has hemorrhaged judges in recent months; many of those hired in the last two years have now been fired or resigned. The judicial vacancies there exacerbate a national backlog of about 3.7 million cases in the immigration court system.

The Trump administration's twin efforts to downsize the federal government and increase immigration arrests are colliding in the immigration system, where immigration courts are run as part of the civil service inside the Department of Justice — apart from the judicial branch, which controls other federal courts.

Postponed day in court

The loss of court judges and staff throws a wrench in the already-limited due process afforded to immigrants seeking relief from deportation, former employees at Chelmsford and lawyers said.

""People know not everybody is going to win,"" Stephanie Marzouk, an immigration attorney in Boston, said about her clients. ""But at least they'll have a chance to have their case heard before a judge who is going to treat them fairly and get some sort of reasoned decision out of it.""

But Marzouk and Born said instead of getting their day in court, their clients are seeing cases postponed by years — even as far out as 2029.

In the meantime, those awaiting final resolution could be arrested or deported, as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to boost mass deportations.

""Whatever date I got today, it will definitely be rescheduled again because at this point, there are not enough judges in that court to address the amount of people and cases,"" said Diecelis Escano, another attorney with cases at Chelmsford.

On July 18, a week after the latest round of dismissals, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency immigration courts are in, posted an immigration judge vacancy announcement, which includes Chelmsford as a location.

Kathryn Mattingly, a spokesperson for EOIR, said reducing the immigration court backlog was one of her agency's highest priorities.

""Under this Administration, the total pending caseload of immigration court cases has fallen by more than 391,000 cases,"" she said, ""and EOIR will continue to use all of its resources to adjudicate immigration cases fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly consistent with due process.""

Boston is an immigration hotspot

The Chelmsford court is part of a region already feeling pressure from not having enough immigration judges.

White House border czar Tom Homan vowed back in February he would be ""bringing hell"" to Boston, pledging to crack down on illegal immigration there. It's one of 18 cities the Department of Homeland Security recently labeled a ""sanctuary jurisdiction"" that ""impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Immigration lawyers report a growing number of cases that are often time-sensitive.

The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration judges, said Chelmsford is among those courts with the biggest decrease in judges in the nation.

""The court will be there physically, but there will be no judges to hear the cases,"" union president Matt Biggs said about what could happen if the downsizing trend continues. He said the administration now has 600 judges nationwide, down from 700 at the end of the Biden administration.

Chelmsford opened for business in April 2024 and was meant to reduce the backlog on the overloaded Boston court. In interviews, former court personnel and lawyers estimate some 70,000 immigration cases were transferred from Boston to Chelmsford then.

EOIR at the time said it wanted to add 21 judges to help process more cases, from asylum applications to final approval of deportation orders.

""It was all for nothing""

Nationally, the union has not identified clear patterns over whom the administration is choosing to dismiss.

There have been three rounds of firings, including getting rid of a class of new judges that had not even taken the bench yet. The dismissals included former Homeland Security prosecutors, veterans, decades-long federal employees, and those with years of immigration law experience.

Others have chosen to leave the bench voluntarily in expectation of layoffs or to take advantage of early retirement.

The vacant halls of the court betray the remnants of judges whose names have been swiftly scrubbed from the EOIR website.

Tucked in a corner on the second floor is the name plate for Nancy Griffiths, an immigration judge who left her decades-long job as a judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and moved from Phoenix to work at Chelmsford.

""It was such an incredibly proud moment. My family came to Washington for my investiture ceremony. My children robed me,"" Griffiths said.

She said she will leave her employment in September.

""We were so excited — and a year and a half later, we're scrambling and trying to figure out what to do with our lives and put our lives back together,"" she said.

Griffiths recalls the ""demoralizing"" process of helping colleagues pack up their offices after they received termination notices.

""People's lives have been torn upside down and that is a waste,"" Griffiths said. She said some people moved away from spouses and children, and EOIR spent money on training and building the new court. ""That was all for nothing,"" she said.

Leaving thousands of cases behind

Former Judge Angela Munro received the email in April notifying her that her employment would be terminated and placed on administrative leave — just a few days shy of the end of her two-year probationary period. Munro spent 16 years working at EOIR, first as a law clerk and then at the Board of Immigration Appeals.

""I didn't have blinders on. I knew what was possible,"" Munro said — given the layoffs of other probationary employees in the federal government. ""But I also knew in my mind that I was doing a good job and that immigration judges are supposedly needed.""

Munro had about 4,000 cases on her docket, she said, and had completed about 1,000. She describes her dismissal as ""abrupt and traumatic."" She returned to her desk around 3 p.m. after issuing what ended up being her final oral decision on an asylum case. That's when she saw an email asking her to pack up her office and be out that day.

Each laid-off or departing judge leaves about 4,000 cases each for their colleagues to pick up, NPR found in its interviews. Tens of thousands of cases are now estimated to have been affected by the loss of judges at Chelmsford.

Former Judge Jenny Beverly, who left EOIR in July, said she was preparing to be assigned thousands of extra cases on behalf of judges who had been let go.

""I wanted to be a part of the system to help move things along,"" Beverly said about her reasons for joining the Chelmsford court.

Beverly commuted up to two hours each way from her home in Maine to adjudicate cases in Chelmsford. Her decision to leave came after leaders at EOIR requested that she shift her workload to handle cases in New Jersey to focus on those already in detention.

""Here I was sitting in Massachusetts, but being asked on short notice to handle cases in New Jersey. And according to my boss, it was because EOIR was prioritizing those cases instead,"" Beverly said. She shared internal communication with NPR that backed up that request.

""Any immigration judge can hear any case at any time, and adjudicating detained immigration cases remains a high priority for the agency,"" Mattingly, the EOIR spokesperson, said in response to questions about judges being moved.

Backlogs grow as EOIR dismisses judges

As more people have been placed in detention, and judges have been dismissed, EOIR has strained with the pressure of keeping up with cases. For example, Beverly left EOIR on July 2, but still had two hearings on the electronic TV schedule in the Chelmsford waiting area on display on July 27.

Griffiths, the judge who moved from Phoenix, noted that her own docket included pending cases from 2013 that over the years had bounced from one judge to another.

The judicial vacancies in Chelmsford exacerbate a national backlog of millions of cases in the immigration court system.

The most recent judicial terminations came after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that immediately allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including for hiring more immigration judges.

The Homeland Security Department has moved quickly to recruit attorneys who will represent ICE in courts like Chelmsford. But the Justice Department has not launched a similar recruitment campaign to hire more immigration judges, despite posting positions online.

Immigration advocates have raised concerns that without the resources to properly process those arrested, the limited due process afforded to some immigrants is undercut.

""EOIR continues to adjudicate immigration cases fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly consistent with due process,"" Mattingly told NPR as a response to those concerns.

Judges said that courtroom misconduct, complaints from private or government attorneys, or an inability to manage caseload were among the reasons judges were dismissed in the past.

But the most recent groups of terminated judges have been left to guess why they were not kept on beyond their two-year probationary period.

Instead of reasons specific to them, each got a short email — similar to one sent to other laid-off employees at the Justice Department and other agencies.

""Pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment,"" according to the emails shared with NPR.

""It was my silent protest""

George Pappas was among the latest judges to be dismissed in July. He listened to cases until his last day but had been expecting the termination notice since the April round of firings — and had already cleared out his office in preparation.

""Anything that was still hanging on my walls was taken down. I took out all my personal belongings,"" Pappas said. ""From that point forward, I worked in a blank room and it was my way of taking control of that which I could control. It was my silent protest.""

Sitting in a nearly empty apartment, he prepared to move back home to North Carolina. He closed his 20-year independent practice to serve as an immigration judge, where he said he wanted to make a dent in the backlog of cases.

""I didn't grant asylum to everybody, but when I did, I changed somebody's life,"" he said. The day he got his notice, he said, he had spent several hours listening to a case where in the end he granted a cancellation of removal, a protection from deportation that allows people to pursue a green card.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8368x4707+0+439/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2F70%2Fd5613ba94ff5b6dcf331254ef7e7%2F20250530-immigration-courts-nierman-1192911.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 10:56:26.139788

For immigrant rights groups, it signals an uphill legal battle against a policy they say will deter participation in public life and expose millions to heightened surveillance and potential prosecution.

Broader 'Self-Deportation' Strategy The plaintiffs argue that the policy—which the Trump administration says aligns immigration enforcement with the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act—is part of a broader ""self-deportation"" strategy.","A federal appeals court on Tuesday declined to halt the implementation of a national registry for noncitizens, delivering a procedural victory for the Trump administration in a case that has drawn sharp criticism from immigrant rights advocates.

In a ruling issued in the name of the court as a whole (a ""per curiam"" order), rather than attributed to a specific judge, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected an emergency request from several advocacy groups to block the Alien Registration Requirement (ARR) while litigation continued.

Judges Karen Henderson, Robert Wilkins, and Bradley Garcia—appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden, respectively—found that the plaintiffs had not met the ""stringent"" standard for an injunction, pending appeal.

Why This Matters

The D.C. Circuit's refusal to pause the ARR means the rule will remain in effect nationwide for months while the appeal plays out. For the Trump administration, the decision represents a step toward reinstating strict enforcement measures grounded in decades-old immigration laws.

For immigrant rights groups, it signals an uphill legal battle against a policy they say will deter participation in public life and expose millions to heightened surveillance and potential prosecution.

The ruling also underscores that the outcome is not being determined along partisan lines—judges appointed by presidents from both parties agreed the plaintiffs had not met the legal standard for an emergency injunction.

What To Know

The regulation, which took effect April 11 after a lower court ruling, requires all noncitizens aged 14 and older to register their fingerprints and carry an identification card or face potential fines or imprisonment. Younger children must be registered by a parent or guardian and re-register upon turning 14.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates the rule could affect between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people, primarily those who entered the country without documentation.

Canadians staying longer than one month also fall under the requirement.

The panel's decision on Tuesday leaves in place an April 10 ruling by U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, who determined that the plaintiffs—Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, United Farm Workers of America, Casa Inc. and Make the Road New York—had not demonstrated that the registry would ""erode their core missions"" and presented only speculative harm.

As the plaintiffs didn't have the required standing, McFadden concluded the court could not decide the merits of the case.

Broader 'Self-Deportation' Strategy

The plaintiffs argue that the policy—which the Trump administration says aligns immigration enforcement with the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act—is part of a broader ""self-deportation"" strategy.

Carl Berquist, general counsel for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, told Courthouse News that the measure ""melds into the administration's entire self-deportation plan of rolling out these [ICE] raids, repurposing the CBP One app into this CBP Home app with a self-deportation tool and trying to roll out some kinds of incentives for people to take action.""

The policy had a ""severe chilling effect"" on noncitizens, Berquist added, implicating ""their Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate"" and ""their First Amendment right to assemble and to protest,"" He described the case as ""a little bit below the radar"" compared with higher-profile immigration disputes but maintained the harm is ""substantial nonetheless.""

The National Immigration Law Center has also warned that enforcement could lead to increased racial profiling. In a statement, the group said: ""While their stated targets are undocumented immigrants, the very mechanics of enforcing registration expand the target to anyone who looks or sounds foreign to law enforcement.""

Newsweek contacted Carl Berquist and the National Immigration Law Center for comment via email on Thursday outside of regular office hours.

What People Are Saying

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: ""The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws—we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce."" An emailed statement carried by Courthouse News continued: ""We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.""

What Happens Next

According to DHS, certain categories of immigrants—including green card holders, individuals with removal orders, people holding Employment Authorization Documents, those admitted with visas, border crossing card holders, and others—are already considered registered under existing law.

The D.C. Circuit has set an expedited schedule for the case, with the plaintiffs' brief due September 16, the government's response due October 16, and a reply from the plaintiffs due November 6.

Oral arguments will follow, with a date to be determined.

For now, the ARR remains in effect nationwide, and both sides are preparing for a legal confrontation in the fall that could test the scope of federal authority over noncitizen identification and tracking.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662078/texas-protests.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 07:57:53.262775

Here's What It Should Look Like - The Fulcrum,"Edward Saltzberg, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/rule-of-law/immigration-reform,"It was under President Clinton that the immigration enforcement system that we know today was created.
Obama tried to answer the challenge of undocumented immigrants with a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill that included a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented individuals.
The Local Economy: Less immigration enforcement cooperation increases economic benefits such as local income per capita, average wages, GDP, and employment rates.
Opponents of Sanctuary Policies Sanctuary policies also have their opponents.
The Effectiveness of Immigration Enforcement: Sanctuary laws create a culture of hostility towards federal law and slow down the work of immigration authorities.","Their extra-legal status is a problem because: They have no rights and are thus subject to abuse. They are not entitled to federal benefits, so their welfare and that of their communities are impacted. They are part of a huge black market of labor that the government cannot regulate. Bottom line, you have 11 million people living here who are not integrated into the larger society.

Contrary to Trump, the problem is not that they are criminals, take jobs away from Americans, and use up resources; those are all lies, fabrications. Undocumented immigrants are no more likely to be criminals than the rest of the population. They are mostly hard-working, tax-paying people with families, trying to eke out an existence in a new country. They don't take away jobs from Americans because American workers don't want the jobs immigrants take. And as a general matter, they are not eligible for federal benefits. The one exception is that they are entitled to access public education.

Those are the facts. But before talking about an answer to the immigration problem, we need to talk about the reasons for having a particular immigration policy to begin with.

Immigrants were welcomed by our country in the 19th century because, first, they supplied people to populate the vast new areas that had been added to our country, and later, they supplied the vast unskilled labor pool that our expanding country and industry desperately needed. America would not have been able to become the economic powerhouse it is without these immigrants.

Where do things stand today? As seen by the reaction of agriculture, meatpackers, and various other businesses, undocumented immigrants are critical to their ability to grow and process the produce and meat needed by our country to feed itself. These are jobs that pay so poorly, with working conditions that are so bad, that Americans have no interest in applying for these positions. Without the flow of undocumented immigrants, this part of our economy would grind to a halt. That would not be in the national interest.

So the question is, why don't we increase our legal immigration quotas to allow the influx of workers this country desperately needs? Why do we not provide a path to citizenship for those who are already here, working and paying taxes?

The answer is xenophobia and bigotry. There are many Americans, not just White supremacists, who don't like the fact that white people will soon no longer be the majority race in the U.S., largely because of the huge influx of Hispanics over the past few decades.

Democrats are viewed as being weak on immigration. Republicans hold up the picture that all but one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates responded in a debate that they favored decriminalizing illegal entry into the U.S. But it wasn't always so. It was under President Clinton that the immigration enforcement system that we know today was created.

Obama tried to answer the challenge of undocumented immigrants with a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill that included a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented individuals. It passed the Senate with substantial Republican support because of the hard line it took on border security. But the Republican-controlled House didn't even take up consideration of the bill. A possible explanation: This xenophobic attitude is especially prevalent in rural areas, and in rural areas lies the strength of the Republican Party.

In the years since then, Trump has done a great disservice to this country by painting a false picture of undocumented immigrants as criminal scum. Because this picture has been embraced as fact by his supporters, it will make it that much harder to pass the legislation necessary to integrate these immigrants into our nation and legally provide agriculture and other industries with the flow of unskilled labor they need to function.

So what's the political and humane solution to the immigration problem? The answer is again a package combining strict border security with immigration reform.

All illegal immigration must be stopped at the border through strict enforcement of our laws.

Undocumented immigrants who are currently in the U.S., working and paying taxes, and who have not been convicted of crimes, should be given a path to citizenship with their families (children and parents) who are already here.

Those undocumented immigrants under 60 who are already here and who do not choose to take advantage of the path to citizenship should be subject to deportation, humanely, back to their country of origin.

The legal immigration quota from Mexico, Central America, and other relevant countries should be increased substantially to allow for the labor needed by American businesses.

A major education program should be undertaken by the federal government to correct the damage done by Trump to the reputation of undocumented immigrants in the minds of many Americans.

The federal government should institute ESL (English as a Second Language) courses for all immigrants.

Some minimum level of mastery of the English language should be required for renewal of a Green Card or other legal status for all immigrants under 60 after they have been here for two years. (Such a requirement already exists for citizenship.)

The last points may be controversial because many people, mostly Democrats and people of color, are against the idea of making English the country's official language and thus would likely be against mandatory English training as well as the language requirement for Green Card renewal.

But if the idea of immigration is to integrate immigrants into the flow of the American economy and society within a reasonable period of time, then a minimum mastery of English should be required, not just for citizenship but for Green Card holders (permanent residents) as well. The idea is not to disrespect the immigrants' culture but to ensure that immigrants are also able to partake in American culture and be part of our society. I am in fact in favor of vibrant ethnic and racial subcultures coexisting with American culture (see my blogpost ""Pluralism or DEI?"").

We are a nation of immigrants. But it's important to realize that this fact was not the result of some do-gooder, humanitarian policy, as exemplified in Emma Lazarus' famous poem that is enshrined at the Statue of Liberty. It was instead the result of the government's acknowledgement of an economic reality—that a major influx of people was needed to grow our country and prosper. This has been the basis of the government's immigration policy through much of our history, despite the xenophobic reaction of much of the population—even of immigrants once they became established—to new waves of immigrants.

As immigration has grown politically contentious, some towns and cities have enacted sanctuary policies to limit local agencies’ cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. First emerging in the 1980s, with San Francisco becoming the first in the nation to pass a sanctuary law relating to immigration, these laws historically reduce and restrict local and federal coordination. Sanctuary city policies often rest on the following arguments:

Federalism: Cities and states are not required to enforce federal law.

Public Safety: Immigrants have less fear of interacting with law enforcement and are more likely to report crimes, cooperate, and serve as witnesses.

Community Health: Immigrants can access basic public services like education and healthcare.

The Local Economy: Less immigration enforcement cooperation increases economic benefits such as local income per capita, average wages, GDP, and employment rates.

In line with the Tenth Amendment, federalism emphasizes the federal government’s responsibility to enforce federal laws and reduces local and state cooperation to that end. Upheld in Printz v. United States and Murphy v. NCAA, the Supreme Court has frequently upheld this separation in landmark cases. With respect to immigrant violators of state or local crime, ICE can issue an “immigration detainer” requesting local officials to hold an individual for up to 48 hours beyond their normal release to allow time to secure their federal detention. However, local authorities do not have to honor this request when sanctuary policies are enacted.

Sanctuary policies layer protections on immigrants in interactions with law enforcement regardless of documentation status. Many sanctuary policies prevent police from asking or sharing information regarding immigration status, which advocates say allows immigrants to contact 911 without hesitation in the event of an emergency. Police agencies also argue that these sanctuary policies are essential in encouraging crime reporting and cooperation in case building.

Protections also extend to immigrants’ access to public services, such as public schools and medical care. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Plyler v. Doe in 1982 paved the way for legislation implementing these protections, as it held that states cannot prevent the children of undocumented immigrants from attending public schools except in cases of potential threat to state interests. Now, states with sanctuary cities like California can prohibit public schools from making immigration status inquiries.

By increasing immigrants’ geographic security through these protections, sanctuary cities also see a boost in economic activity. In fact, one study at Oregon State University found a correlation between “overall per capita income, wages, GDP, and total employment” and the degree of protection for immigrants under sanctuary policies. Although unable to receive public benefits, many undocumented immigrants also pay taxes and boost local revenues, contributing 37.3 billion dollars towards state and local funds. Also in 2022, immigrants paid 96.7 billion dollars in taxes, of which 59.4 billion dollars was allocated to the federal government.

Opponents of Sanctuary Policies

Sanctuary policies also have their opponents. They argue that such policies undermine:

The Rule of Law: Sanctuary cities challenge federal prerogatives over immigration enforcement.

Public Safety: Law enforcement has to release individuals who have committed a crime back into the community despite their pending immigration status.

The Effectiveness of Immigration Enforcement: Sanctuary laws create a culture of hostility towards federal law and slow down the work of immigration authorities.

Public Budgets: Jurisdictions spend taxpayer dollars to provide services to undocumented immigrants.

While sanctuary laws are constitutional under the principle of federalism, opponents argue theycontribute to a legal “nullification crisis.” They argue the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, and states and localities lack the authority to set immigration policy. They point to one federal law that prohibits any level of government from preventing the sharing of immigration status with the federal government. Critics argue that sanctuary laws that prohibit information sharing violate this exclusive federal jurisdiction.

Opponents have also raised concerns about the undocumented immigrants accused, charged, or convicted of committing crimes. In some cases, local police in sanctuary cities might release rather than detain these individuals, potentially facilitating the continuation of their crimes. In 2015, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant, shot and killed Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. Even after facing several felonies and deportations, local officials still declined to honor the ICE detainer request. Even so, many sanctuary laws also include exceptions for serious and violent crimes.

Sanctuary laws also hinder the work of immigration enforcement. Even if ICE does not utilize local facilities, they can foster a culture of hostility towards ICE operations and reduce effectiveness. In 2018, Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland tweeted a warning to immigrants of ICE activity in the city. ICE respondedby criticizing Schaaf’s action as endangering agents and allowing targets to avoid arrest.

Despite economic benefits to the greater city, critics argue that undocumented immigrants place a fiscal burden on local jurisdictions. From public education to medical services, Fair reported that illegal immigration had accrued a net cost of 150.7 billion dollars to United States taxpayers by 2023. In Tennessee, educating undocumented students costs the state 3.9 million dollars annually, and in Florida, two billion dollars are spent providing education and healthcare to undocumented immigrants. Even with the current cost of the undocumented migrant crisis in New York City, research estimates its five billion dollar cost for the two years will double in 2025.

Conclusion

The divide between federal, state, and local governments over immigration enforcement is a contentious and unresolved issue. Despite sanctuary cities’ laws and disputed net gains, the conflict ultimately boils down to a legal debate over federal and state jurisdiction. In lieu of an answer, President Trump signed an executive order in February 2025 to end federal funding for sanctuary cities, kicking off a storm of reactionary lawsuits which may yield a settlement.

The Mason Board of Mayor and Aldermen called a special meeting to review two contracts: one between the town and CoreCivic, and one between the town and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

After a chaotic exchange between aldermen and a crowd of constituents and residents of nearby towns in West Tennessee, the board approved the CoreCivic contract 4-1 with two abstentions. The ICE contract passed 3-2 with two abstentions.

Neither document was provided to the public prior to the meeting, and town attorney Nathan Bicks said he and others were working on the CoreCivic contract until Monday, giving the board about 24 hours to review it in its final form before the vote.

Crowds flanked the 1,500-person town’s Main Street more than 40 minutes before the meeting began, holding signs decrying ICE and opposing the facility’s reopening.

The 600-bed prison closed in 2021 after the Department of Justice, under order from then-President Joe Biden, did not renew its contract with CoreCivic to operate the facility. President Donald Trump reversed Biden’s order against contracting with private detention facilities in January.

Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman, the first Egyptian immigrant to represent the town, voted in favor of both contracts, citing the job and economic opportunities that would come with reopening the facility.

“We need everybody’s support, everybody’s business here,” he said. “We open arms for everybody. We’re not against nobody.”

Alderman Virginia Rivers, who previously served as the town’s vice mayor, disagreed.

“I feel you should have been notified and made aware of this situation before now,” Rivers told the audience. “I understand and support the need to deport actual criminals, but the majority of the people who are being deported and detained are lawful citizens.”

“We, as the officials of the Town of Mason that was elected by the citizens, should consider the consequences and the hurt that this will cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools, and many families,” Rivers said, adding that entering into a contract with CoreCivic and ICE would “make our city complicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.”

Mason officials held the meeting in the Mason Fire Department garage across the street from Mason City Hall to accommodate some of the larger crowd. The remaining audience stood outside the garage doors, chanting and drumming through most of the meeting. Officials passed around a microphone attached to a karaoke machine, and audience members repeatedly yelled out that they could not hear what officials were saying.

The majority of audience members who spoke at the meeting opposed the contracts.

Those who spoke in support pointed to property tax, impact fees and utility revenue that would come from the facility. CoreCivic stated the facility would generate about $325,000 in annual property taxes, and an estimated $1.2 million in annual utility payments. When fully operational, the facility would generate about $200,000 in annual impact fees to the town, according to the company.

Eloise Thompson, a fifth-generation resident of nearby Fayette County, said she was against Mason “becoming a for-profit center for human suffering.”

She said Mason has other alternatives to create jobs and stimulate the local economy that “speak more to the character of who we are.”

Darryle Donell, a veteran and Mason resident, said he previously worked at the facility when it was run by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became CoreCivic.

“That prison ain’t never been good for the town,” he said, calling for transparency, honesty and loyalty from town leaders. “I don’t see no prison. I see a concentration camp.”

Christa Poindexter, another Mason resident, approached Noeman during the meeting and asked why he supported the contracts.

“I want the job. Jobs,” he said.

At one point, at least three board members — Noeman, Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, and Alderman Alethea Harris — exited the building during a period of public comment.

Givhan voted in favor of the CoreCivic contract but abstained from voting on the ICE contract.

“When I moved here 20 years ago, CCA or CoreCivic employed several of my family members, and it was thriving,” he said after the meeting adjourned. “I was actually excited when we first got word that they were coming, that it was going to reopen.”

The “negative connotation that’s connected with just the word ICE … you feel it, and in your heart of hearts, you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror,” he said of his abstention.

Givhan said he exited the building, which was not air conditioned, during the meeting to “get some air” and pray. He said he did not talk to other board members and did not see other members talking to each other.

CoreCivic Public Affairs Manager Brian Todd said 2,100 people have already applied for the roughly 240 job openings at the facility. These roles would pay a starting salary of about $26.50 per hour, according to a statement distributed by CoreCivic representatives at the meeting.

“You all may feel that there’s no oversight and accountability at the facility, and that is far, far from the truth,” CoreCivic representative Jerry Langford said. “The facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability … our government partners will have a presence at that facility while we’re operating, including regular audits and on-site monitors. Both our company and the government partners share a deep commitment to humane care.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-97/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mason002seqn-1024x6831755079454.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=7mQX6nGM,N,,2025-08-13 10:56:39.914730

Now, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn these rulings.
The district court then concluded that ""sole reliance on the four enumerated factors does not constitute reasonable suspicion.""
The United States also argues in its brief to the Supreme Court that the district court order requiring compliance with the Constitution will unduly interfere with ICE.
Finally, the government argues in the Supreme Court that a federal district court cannot issue a remedy that applies throughout the district.","Of the dozens of district court orders stopping Trump administration violations of the U.S. Constitution, none is more important than the recent temporary restraining order to prevent ICE from violating the Constitution. On July 12, United States District Court Judge Maame E. Frimpong, in the Central District of California, issued a TRO, saying that she was presented with a ""mountain of evidence"" proving ICE's stops were without reasonable suspicion and were based on race. On Aug. 1, the United States Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Perdomo v. Noem, upheld Judge Frimpong's order.

Now, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn these rulings. The brief it has filed is stunning in seeking to make ICE's actions unreviewable, even when it is clearly violating the Constitution. It is imperative that the court, which has overwhelming sided with President Trump, affirm the lower courts.

The law is clear that the Fourth Amendment requires that police, including ICE, must have reasonable suspicion to stop someone and probable cause to take them into custody. The law is also well established that police violate equal protection if they use race as a basis for deciding who to stop or arrest.

Judge Frimpong found that ICE was violating these basic constitutional requirements. The focus was on ICEs use of roving patrols to stop individuals. As the 9th Circuit said, these ""contact teams"" ""typical[ly] ... consist of three to five agents who contact individuals in public places such as streets, sidewalks, and publicly accessible portions of businesses."" ICE official Kyle Harvick said, ""Certain types of businesses, including carwashes, were selected for [contact team] encounters because past experience demonstrated that they are likely to employ persons without legal documentation. During operations in Los Angeles, [federal] agents temporarily detained individuals, and made arrests for immigration violations and federal criminal statutes.""

The plaintiffs include individuals who were stopped and detained solely based on their race. The plaintiffs also included associations, such as the United Farm Workers, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights whose members have been stopped by ICE without reasonable suspicion and based on race.

The district court found that the plaintiffs were ""likely to succeed in showing that the seizures are based upon the four enumerated factors"" or a subset of them. Those factors are (1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location; and (4) the type of work one does. The district court then concluded that ""sole reliance on the four enumerated factors does not constitute reasonable suspicion.""

It is striking that the United States does not deny that ICE was doing this. Indeed, the 9th Circuit, in upholding the district court's temporary restraining order against ICE, powerfully explained: ""Defendants did not dispute the district court's finding that detentive stops requiring reasonable suspicion have occurred. They did not dispute that these detentive stops have been based solely on the four enumerated factors. They did not challenge the district court's findings that those stops are part of a pattern of conduct that has apparent official approval. And, finally, they did not meaningfully dispute the district court's conclusion that sole reliance on the four enumerated factors, alone or in combination, does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of reasonable suspicion.""

In other words, the government does not deny that it is systematically and intentionally violating the Constitution. Instead, its argument is that the federal court lacks the authority to stop the unconstitutional conduct. It is no less than a claim that the government can blatantly violate the Constitution and no court can stop it.

The government makes three arguments in its Supreme Court brief. First, it contends that plaintiffs lack standing under City of Los Angeles v. Lyons because they cannot show that they personally will be stopped again by ICE. In Lyons, the Supreme Court held that a man who had been stopped by Los Angeles police and subjected to a chokehold lacked standing to challenge police use of chokeholds because he could not show it was likely that he would be choked again in the future. But the existence of an admitted ICE policy of stopping people based on race, speaking Spanish, presence at a particular location, and the type of work one does, makes it realistic that the plaintiffs will be stopped again by ICE agents. As the 9th Circuit explained: ""each of the individual plaintiffs has standing to seek injunctive relief because there is a 'realistic[] threat[]' that each will be stopped without reasonable suspicion as part of Defendants' Operation at Large.""

The United States also argues in its brief to the Supreme Court that the district court order requiring compliance with the Constitution will unduly interfere with ICE. But ICE, like all parts of the government, must comply with the Fourth Amendment and equal protection. As the 9th Circuit explained, ""Defendants, of course, 'cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.'""

Finally, the government argues in the Supreme Court that a federal district court cannot issue a remedy that applies throughout the district. The government says a court cannot issue a district-wide relief, but rather only provide relief to the named plaintiffs. That makes no sense and would make it impossible to stop illegal government practices within a federal district. The government relies on Trump v. CASA. But that case disapproves of nationwide injunctions. The court did not discuss injunctions within a federal district. How can unconstitutional government actions ever be stopped if a court is limited to giving relief to just the parties in a lawsuit?

Of course, that is exactly what the Trump administration is trying to establish: the government can violate the Constitution and no court can stop it. That just cannot be right.

The district court rightly said that ICE could not use four factors in making a stop: (1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location; and (4) the type of work one does. All of these are innocuous and violate no law. ICE should not be able to use them to stop or apprehend people. Period.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration in many cases about separation of powers, such as the authority of the president to fire agency officials. I hope the court sees this case differently. It involves fundamental aspects of individual freedom and equality. In light of the undisputed facts in the case, the Supreme Court should not stay the district court's order. ICE must comply with the Constitution.",https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dailyjournal-prod/articles/images/000/387/081/medium/shutterstock_2615419741.jpg?1755029465,N,,2025-08-13 08:56:37.486142

The Virginia-based fourth US circuit court of appeals in a 2-1 decision said the unions were unlikely to prevail on claims that Doge would violate federal privacy laws by accessing data at the US Department of Education, treasury department, and office of personnel management.

The court refused to block Doge’s access to the agencies’ computer systems and data such as social security numbers and individuals’ citizenship status pending the outcome of the case.

The decision reverses a temporary injunction issued by a federal judge in Maryland, which had been paused by the appeals court in April.

The agencies involved in the case and the unions that sued, which include the American Federation of Teachers and the National Federation of Federal Employees, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Donald Trump after taking office in January launched Doge, then headed by the billionaire Elon Musk, to dramatically shrink government bureaucracy and federal spending.

Doge, which is not a formal government agency, has overseen job and spending cuts at nearly every federal agency and has been the focus of numerous lawsuits. Musk stepped down from Doge in May after publicly falling out with Trump.

The fourth circuit on Tuesday said the unions that sued along with a group of military veterans had not shown how they would be injured by Doge accessing agencies’ computer systems. They also probably lacked legal standing to sue because that access is not a “final agency action” that can form the basis of a lawsuit, the court said.

A dissenting judge said it was prudent to temporarily block access to the data while the case plays out, and that the standard his colleagues had imposed on the plaintiffs was too high.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a7e7422099cbac8912b8bda4b94252fe4459ce/456_0_2282_1826/master/2282.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f467e67c761c1986e84e1034f65f2c08",N,,2025-08-13 07:58:20.424040

In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened.","A key annual United States government report on global human rights abuses has drastically shifted focus, with references removed to abuses based on sexual orientation, and poor conditions downplayed in ally nations while taking aim at those who have clashed with President Donald Trump.

Released on Tuesday, the 2024 State Department Human Rights Report, was issued months late as Trump appointees altered an earlier draft dramatically to bring it in line with America First values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, and “Liberty,” and “Security of the Person.”

The department referred to its new report as “streamlined” and focused on remaining “aligned to the administration’s executive orders”.

While the 2023 report contains a lengthy introduction with numerous appendices and citations, the newest report has a single introductory page that stresses a desire to “minimize the amount of statistical data in the report”. An NPR analysis found individual country reports are, on average, one-third the length of the previous year’s.

There is no mention of discrimination against women, members of the LGBTQ community, or on the basis of race in the latest report introduction.

Instead, the report sounds an alarm about the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues.

Any criticism of governments for their treatment of LGBTQ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appears to have been omitted.

The report’s section on Israel is much shorter than last year’s edition and contains no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. Some 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in October 2023.

While last year’s report underscored numerous acts of anti-Semitism in Hungary, noting that a local survey found half the population were “moderately or strongly anti-Semitic”, the new report says the close Trump ally has “made combating anti-Semitism a top priority, publicly emphasizing its welcoming and open environment for Jews”.

The report claims “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador – where Trump has gained help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house migrant deportees in a high-security mega-prison.

Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that the report “purposefully fail[ed]” to capture rights abuses in a number of countries.

This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe.

On Monday, rights group coalition the Council for Global Equality sued (PDF) the State Department to release report documents, alleging the department had potentially manipulated its latest human rights report.

For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

This year’s report was prepared following a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in April, wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists,” saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”.

Taking aim at Brazil and South Africa

In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation had declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, among others.

Bolsonaro is on trial before the Supreme Court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 electoral loss to leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Trump has referred to the case as a “witch hunt” and called it grounds for a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian goods.

In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened. It stated that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

In last year’s report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.

Trump, earlier this year, issued an executive order that called for the US to resettle Afrikaners, describing them as victims of “violence against racially disfavored landowners,” allegations that echoed far-right claims but which have been contested by South Africa’s government.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-18T212340Z_299766331_RC20PFAHKLDB_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-ELSALVADOR-VENEZUELA-1755026732.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-12 23:57:31.666618

At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”.
“Let’s be clear, Black history is American history.

The Smithsonian Institution said that a placard was removed for reasons related to consistency and because it “blocked the view of the objects inside its case”.","The White House has ordered an extensive review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions in advance of next year’s 250th anniversary of the United States, with the goal of aligning the institution’s content with President Donald Trump’s interpretation of US history.

In a letter sent on Tuesday to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the White House laid out in detail the steps it expects the organisation to take so that museum content can be reviewed for a focus on “Americanism”.

The federal government will review public-facing museum content, such as social media, exhibition text and educational materials, to “assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals”, the letter said.

“This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the letter added.

In a statement responding to the letter, the Smithsonian said it remained committed to “scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history”.

“We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents,” it said.

The White House said that the review is in line with the Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History Executive Order, which Trump signed in March.

At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”.

“Donald Trump’s idea that the National Museum of African American History and Culture is guilty of distorting our nation’s history or painting our ‘founding principles’ in a ‘negative light’ is patently ridiculous,” the caucus said in a statement.

“Let’s be clear, Black history is American history. Any rhetoric that opposes this notion is not only factually incorrect but blatantly racist,” the caucus said.

“It is the Trump Administration that bans books, words, and phrases that do not fit their narrative. It is the Trump Administration that wants to erase and retell our history,” the caucus added.

The White House said the review would initially focus on the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

The museums under review are all located in Washington, DC, where the president this week ordered the deployment of the US National Guard to tackle a purported crime wave that city officials in the capital have refuted.

The museums all offer free admission and attract millions of visitors each year, with the National Museum of American History alone recording 2 million in-person visits in 2024.

The Smithsonian has repeatedly denied allegations that it has changed or removed exhibit details in response to pressure from the Trump administration. Recently, the institution removed references to Trump’s two impeachments from an exhibit on the US presidency. The Smithsonian Institution said that a placard was removed for reasons related to consistency and because it “blocked the view of the objects inside its case”.

“We were not asked by any Administration or other government officials to remove content from the exhibit,” the Institution said.

The Smithsonian Institution, which runs 21 museums and the National Zoo, said at the time that the impeachment section of the museum would be updated in the coming weeks to “reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25163573387889-1755043215.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-13 00:56:27.767375

Poor prison conditions in El Salvador were not included. There was an entire paragraph from last year's report.

Instead, the report simplifies the conditions, saying there were ""no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,"" which also appears again in the section for Hungary.

Human rights violations of peaceful assembly in China are also missing.

According to an analysis conducted by , this year's reports are about one-third the length of last year's. The reports on El Salvador and Moldova are more than 75% shorter.

During a State Department briefing on Tuesday, spokesperson Tammy Bruce emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to human rights, although she refused to comment on why exactly these sections were removed.

She pointed out that some of the edits stem from the changeover in presidential administrations.

We weren't going to release something compiled and written by the previous administration; it needed to change based on the point of view and vision of the Trump administration,"" Bruce said.

She said the report does not reflect a change in U.S. policy when it comes to human rights. The State Department also stopped ranking countries.

Bruce added that although reports are important, it is also about action.

He commands Task Force 51, the Guard contingent that Trump admin sent to LA in June.
The DOJ then showed a clip from President Trump's press conference Monday where he announced he is deploying the National Guard in D.C.","As closing arguments began, the California DOJ gave historical context about the Posse Comitatus Act, which dates back to 1878. It prohibits the use of military to execute U.S. laws, without authorization of Congress or by the Constitution.

California noted the 8th Circuit has called PCA ""the embodiment of a long tradition of suspicion and hostility of military force for domestic purposes.""

CA DOJ: ""Occupation of a civilian city by nearly 5,000 troops for 60 days will have and has had a prescriptive effect on that population. That is exactly the kind of standing army the founding fathers feared. Each of the incidents is a PCA violation.""

CA DOJ goes back to the Trump administration's key defense, that the military deployment was solely for protection of federal property and personnel. Photographs were again shown of troops in a blockade line and interacting with a protestor. ""Defendants cannot wordsmith their way around the law. Calling it 'security' doesn't make it any less illegal.""

The CA DOJ concluded closing arguments asking for a permanent injunction to ""bring a halt to the unlawful military crusade across this state.""

Before US DOJ started closing arguments, Judge Breyer asked Eric Hamilton (US deputy asst AG) this: ""Is there any limitation to use of the military in an operation which is being conducted by federal agents? For example, one, does there have to be a threat? Two, does there have to be some evaluation for threat in terms of consequences of the threat? Three, is there anything, I haven't seen any evidence in this case, as to the adequacy or inadequacy of local law enforcement addressing that threat?""

Hamilton says there isn't anything in Posse Comitatus Act that requires some pre-operation threat assessment. The ""National Guard was federalized in early June because of violent protests in the LA area and we have seen at trial evidence of violence that persisted in July.""

Judge Breyer continued with many questions for Hamilton (US DOJ) in quite impassioned tone. ""Unless military is the first line of defense...it's usually local law enforcement that is the first line of defense. But there is no evidence in these situations...that they were unable or unwilling to enforce the law... Is that a correct analysis?""

Then Hamilton got into his closing arguments, also starting with the Posse Comitatus Act. He highlighted 9th Circuit cases that mention military being used as ""backup security."" Quote from Kahn (9th Circuit. 1994): ""The district court concluded that the Navy provided only logistical support and backup security...therefore did not violate the law.""

Now as to POTUS authority to federalize National Guard (see 10 USC 12406), Hamilton mentions the rebellion clause saying, ""It's a rebellion because (Trump) says it's a rebellion."" Judge Breyer does not seem satisfied with that answer and continued Q &A.

Hamilton referred back to witness statements, including Monday testimony from Army Deputy Chief of Staff William Harrington, who said the Guard had no interactions with civilians in reference to a July 7 MacArthur Park operation which took ""20 minutes."" Harrington testified that they did not engage in law enforcement activities.

Note: These were only closing arguments for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Judge Breyer said he's expecting arguments on ""legal issues"" Wednesday.

Court has resumed for Day 2 of the Newsom v. Trump bench trial in U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's San Francisco courtroom. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman is back on the witness stand first thing this morning. He commands Task Force 51, the Guard contingent that Trump admin sent to LA in June.

DOJ lawyer is questioning Sherman about a June 23 memo from Sec. Hegseth about the LA mission, reading: ""Service members may not perform direct law enforcement activities such as searches, seizures, evidence collection or arrest."" Sherman testifies troops did not violate that.""

Sherman says he wants the public to know ""we were doing exactly what we were told to do, exactly in line with federal law, and that we were not conducting law enforcement operations,"" adding the Guard was in LA to protect federal personnel and property, nothing else.

A U.S. Army North Fifth Army slideshow was shown in court again, which has guidance about ""prohibited law enforcement functions"" under the Posse Comitatus Act. It was a long list, but these are in red: security patrols, traffic controls, crowd control, riot control.

Sherman says his understanding, according to Trump and Hegseth memos, is those functions are red because the Guard can legally do under certain circumstances. Judge Breyer had a series of follow-up questions, asking why would those be listed as prohibited if soldiers can perform those duties.

Then came California Department of Justice Deputy AG Jane Reilley for the cross-examination. It was about a half-hour or so questioning from both parties largely about specifics of the Department of Defense's request for Guard assistance in LA.

Reilley asked Sherman if the DoD asked the Guard to set up perimeters, would he grant the request? He says without an identified imminent threat, it would have ""never gone past our legal review.""

The DOJ then showed a clip from President Trump's press conference Monday where he announced he is deploying the National Guard in D.C.

It was this quote from President Trump: ""We have other cities also that are bad, very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem, and then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We're not going to lose our cities over this...we're going to clean up D.C. real quick.""

The CA DOJ asks Sherman if he has received any word or request for sending more National Guard troops to other California cities (like Oakland, as Trump mentioned Monday). Sherman said no.

With no further questioning, he was dismissed as a witness.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17503297_081125-kgo-ap-national-guard-2-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-13 00:56:31.537854

U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) to reduce capacity, improve cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in holding rooms inside 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Lower Manhattan.

The order comes after a lawsuit filed on behalf of detained migrants claimed they were subjected to unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, extreme temperatures, and a lack of access to soap, toothbrushes, and other essentials, according to The Associated Press.

The migrants said they were fed inedible ""slop"" and were subjected to the stench of sweat, urine and feces, in part due to the rooms having open toilets.

One woman said that during her period, she couldn’t access menstrual products because only two were made available to an entire room of women, court filings revealed.

At a hearing Tuesday, the plaintiffs’ attorney, Heather Gregorio, described the facility as having ""inhumane and horrifying conditions.""

DOJ attorney Jeffrey Oestericher acknowledged that detainees were receiving only two meals per day and were not provided medication or sleeping mats. However, he pushed back on the overcrowding claims, according to reports by The Hill.

""Present conditions are relevant,"" Oestericher told the judge at the hearing. ""To the extent they are talking about overcrowding, it does not appear presently that there is overcrowding.""

""I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,"" he added. ""I think there is some factual disagreement.""

In Tuesday's order, Kaplan ordered immigration officials to provide 50 square feet per person. This means the largest hold room’s capacity will be brought down to about 15 people after detainees said there had been at least 40, according to The Associated Press.

The cells must also be thoroughly cleaned three times a day. Officials are additionally required to provide clean bedding mats and an adequate supply of soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste and other hygiene products.

The judge also ordered officials to ensure detainees have confidential telephone calls with lawyers, including interpreters for those who do not speak English.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.” Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.
“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”

It added that the government “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to undermine democracy” and specifically mentioned suppressing the speech of Bolsonaro and his supporters.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/news/npr-stories/nx-s1-5500039/ap25223556235849-scaled-e1755042943949-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 23:57:39.619986

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,” Kaplan said.

Under Kaplan’s order, the government will be forced to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products.

He has also instructed immigration officials to allocate 4.6 square metres (50 square feet) per person, shrinking the capacity of the largest room from 40 or more detainees to just 15.

Finally, to ensure access to legal representation, Kaplan said the government must ensure detainees have accommodations to make confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

Inside the complaint

The changes come in response to a complaint filed by lawyers for a Peruvian asylum-seeker named Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was taken into custody on August 8 after appearing for a scheduled court date.

He was imprisoned at 26 Federal Plaza after his arrest. But his lawyers have argued that Barco Mercado and others in the facility have faced “crowded, squalid, and punitive conditions”. They also said they were denied access to their client after his arrest.

Barco Mercado testified that the holding room was “extremely crowded” and “smelled of sewage” and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Barco Mercado has since been transferred to a facility in upstate New York.

In court filings, other detainees complained that they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products while locked in the 26 Federal building.

They also said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and faeces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

A mobile phone video recorded last month showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four holding rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

ICE responds to allegations of ill treatment

At Tuesday’s hearing, a government lawyer conceded that “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” said Jeffrey S Oestericher, a representative for the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York.

The government also tried to downplay allegations of overcrowding at the facility and inhumane conditions.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, the assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that 24 people were held in the building’s four holding rooms as of Monday.

That number was well below the 154-person limit imposed by the city fire marshal for the floor.

Zanello also said that each room was equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products were available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products.

The 26 Federal Plaza site has become a flashpoint in New York as the city contends with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration.

The holding cells are on the 10th floor, just two floors below an immigration court. The building also houses the New York field office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other government offices.

While ICE has conducted high-profile raids on factories, farms and other workplaces elsewhere in the country, New York City has seen its immigration arrests largely unfold in court buildings, as migrants and asylum seekers exit their civil immigration hearings.

Critics have denounced such arrests as violations of the right to due process. They warn that, by carrying out arrests in court buildings, officials could discourage foreign nationals from pursuing lawful paths to immigration.

But in January, the Trump administration rescinded guidelines that limited immigration arrests in “sensitive locations”, court buildings generally considered to be among them.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250808__2229095057__v2__MidRes__IceDetainsImmigrantsInsideNewYorkCityCourthou-1755036091.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-12 22:56:37.256848

The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year, the report said.","The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticise restrictions on political speech by US allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration's focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration's view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump's immigration crackdown.

This year's reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners, the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration's changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to adjust the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know, the overview said. On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

The new reports reveal a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe, Amnesty International said in a statement.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the US. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses in El Salvador in 2024 and that the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers' freedom of association.

Those governments did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation significantly worsening. The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country's apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.

It also said the government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three Nato allies worsened during the year.

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior US officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro's speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump's ire by prosecuting his ally former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and led to the imposition of massive US tariffs and sanctions against Brazil's Supreme Court chief justice.

The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year, the report said. The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users' access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.

It added that the government undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to undermine democracy and specifically mentioned suppressing the speech of Bolsonaro and his supporters.",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-05/02/thumb/fitandfill/1200X630/1746157517-2157.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 22:56:41.507933

Judge Lewis Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.

Cellphone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products. They said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

Kaplan ordered immigration officials to allocate 50 sq feet per person – shrinking the largest hold room’s capacity to about 15 people after detainees said 40 or more were being jammed in. The building, home to immigration court and the FBI’s New York field office, has become an epicenter of Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide an adequate supply of hygiene products. Addressing concerns that detainees were not able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential legal telephone calls.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,” Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” government lawyer Jeffrey S Oestericher said, adding that he agreed “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.

The lawsuit – filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union – sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called “inhumane and horrifying conditions”.

Some detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza far longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.

Murad Awawdeh, the president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, welcomed Kaplan’s ruling as a “step forward” but said the facility “must be shut down permanently”.

New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June after he tried to lock arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain, said the decision “is a much-needed rebuke of Trump’s cruel immigration policies”.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, of Ice’s New York City field office of enforcement and removal operations, wrote that as of Monday, a total of 24 people were held in the building’s four hold rooms – well shy of the city fire marshal’s 154-person cap.

Each room has at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products, Zanello said.

Sergio Barco Mercado, the lawsuit’s named plaintiff, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing.

Barco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the US in 2022, said his holding room was “extremely crowded”, cold and “smelled of sewage”, and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Another detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the US when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration hearing. He said officers told him he’d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.

Lopez Benitez said an officer showed him a cellphone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers blasted air conditioning and doled out meals that “looked like dog food”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768b50d6a459ff9e1ebc05b79455ec078fa390c0/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2fc6b26e867700091fab04b044d132a",N,,2025-08-12 22:56:49.344669

The video posted on Facebook shows Enforcement and Removal Operations officers — or arresting officers working under ICE — forcibly taking two people into custody.

The driver in the video drives onto the property, then stops next to three vehicles, including two large grey Ford SUVs. The officers are seen urging the driver to go away.

The driver gets out of the vehicle and says, “Why are you stopping my guys?” as one officer escorts a man with his hands behind his back.

As the confrontation continues, one ICE officer tells the driver that he is “impeding a federal investigation” and that the officers will arrest him, too.

“They’re my workers, they’re my workers,” says the driver in the video. “They didn’t do anything for you guys to stop them. They didn’t do anything.”

The situation escalates as two officers pull the passenger out of the stopped vehicle and pin him to the ground on his stomach.

The video later shows the two SUVs driving out of the property, with the two people in custody inside.

Property Manager at Alpine Mountain Ranch and Club Audrey Williams noted that she had seen the video and confirmed that it was on the ranch’s property, but she was not at work when the arrests occurred.

Williams added that the ranch gates open around 6:45 a.m. each morning and remain open during business hours for the public to access various construction sites across the property.

According to Jerry Hernandez, the executive director of the local organization Integrated Community, ICE activity has also been seen at a construction site in town and at a bus stop on 7th Street, where three people were said to have been arrested.

While Hernandez did not have an exact number of people who were taken into custody, he confirmed that two people in custody were currently en route to Denver.

“One of the things that we had confirmed was that ICE could not and did not engage in traffic stops,” said Hernandez. “So we were telling our clients, ‘Don’t worry, they can’t pull you over.’ But apparently, that’s not the case because of this branch (Enforcement and Removal Operations).”

Hernandez said one of the men arrested in the video was issued an “order of removal,” which was most likely the reason for the traffic stop. However, Hernandez noted that the man had been “compliant” with his court dates.

Police Chief Mark Beckett said law enforcement has not recently communicated with ICE about an increased presence or recent arrests, but noted that this isn’t unique to Steamboat Springs.

“We’re hearing from different sheriffs and chiefs across the state … ICE and (Enforcement and Removal Operations) are operating without any notification,” said Beckett. “We haven’t been approached. Our policy is still what it was (earlier this year), which is we’re not going to participate in enforcement action. That’s probably why they aren’t notifying any local agencies anymore.”

“What they told us originally was they were going to focus on those who were actually wanted criminally, like gang members,” continued Beckett. “But, you know, all I have to go on is the same thing you’re seeing.”

Beckett added that he couldn’t be sure if ICE is arresting migrants without criminal histories, but noted that the Steamboat Springs Police Department “continues to support all of our populations, including the undocumented community.”

Routt County Sheriff Doug Scherar also said he was unaware of an increased ICE presence in the county, and noted that the sheriff’s office does not participate in any immigration enforcement.

“Unfortunately … (ICE) has put themselves in a silo right now, so we don’t hear anything at all,” Beckett said. “And frankly, I don’t think we’re going to. I think that’s going to be how they will continue to move forward. They’re just going to do whatever they’re going to do.”

Scherar encourages anyone concerned about an increased ICE presence in the community should reach out to Integrated Community for assistance.

“I know the community is very, very afraid and concerned,” said Hernandez. “We have families that are not sending their kids to school or that are not going to work because of this.”

For those impacted, Hernandez stressed utilizing “Know Your Rights” websites and other resources provided by Integrated Community.

“These types of events can cause high levels of anxiety and mental health stress on children,” Hernandez added. “It’s important for us to continue to be supportive of each other.”

“We make (the links) available to our clients so that they can be informed when someone comes knocking on their door. Regardless of status, you have rights,” Hernandez explained.

Hernandez also emphasized taking steps to plan ahead, like putting a legal fund in place, establishing a caregiver for children or placing “Know Your Rights” cards in vehicles and houses.

“If (migrants and immigrants) are in a mixed-status household, who can pick your kids up from school? That all needs to be spelled out ahead of time,” said Hernandez.

“We understand that law enforcement has a job to do … We recognize that,” said Hernandez. “Our position is that we’re going to continue to be a source of help for the immigrant population in Steamboat because they’re a vital part of this community.”

The results were alarming.

“When we began in 2000, we recorded 150 to 160 cases of human rights and constitutional rights violations,” said Garcia, executive director of Border Network for Human Rights. “What we did with those findings is to educate the community about their rights during encounters with law enforcement and also approach the agencies we believed were engaged in a pattern of constitutional violations.”

The complaints included racial profiling, physical and psychological abuse, warrantless searches, arbitrary arrests and instant deportations without due process. Some things have improved during that 25-year period – there were years when no complaints were reported against the U.S. Border Patrol, for instance, and the agency reined in its vehicle pursuit policy to cut down on accidents.

“We educate the people and sometimes we educate the agencies themselves on how the community sees them and how they should always be cognizant of their rights,” Garcia said.

But new worries have surfaced with a new U.S. president bent on the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and the arrival of thousands of soldiers to West Texas and Southern New Mexico. In addition, a federal immigration agency is rushing to hire new agents to look for and deport migrants.

Those are some of the reasons behind BNHR’s latest abuse documentation campaign set to begin this month. The group is setting up 30 tables near international ports of entry, in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with a high Hispanic or immigrant population from El Paso to Del Rio, Texas, and from Anthony, New Mexico, to Albuquerque.

“We will not prejudge. We have an objective documentation process. We ask if their rights are violated, they tell us then we go about verifying the allegations. Are there any witnesses? We learned that from journalists – that it is necessary to have who did what to whom, where and when. If we cannot verify, we won’t take the case,” Garcia said.

The volunteers range from moms of school-aged children to retirees. They will wear T-shirts with the documentation campaign logo and large badges with their names.

Some of them told Border Report they already have witnessed abusive behavior from law enforcement in their communities.

“They went into a place looking for one person and they took many. They detained a mother (in front of) a school and brought down her children from the bus. All the kids were upset,” said Maria Salazar.

She told the story of a neighbor who is a lawful permanent resident and whose vehicle was targeted by immigration agents looking for an unrelated individual. “They punctured her tires, and now they don’t want to pay for the damage,” Salazar said.

Lourdes Vasquez is a New Mexico activist who will be visiting churches, stores and other gathering places in Las Cruces, Anthony, Chaparral and Sunland Park.

“We see lots of worries in the community. They hear about ICE going into homes. They have been stopped walking in their neighborhoods,” Vasquez said, adding it is important for these residents to not be afraid of documenting these run-ins for the sake of accountability.

Garcia said he will present a report in October with the findings of the latest two-month documentation campaign. He said he will show the report to leaders of federal and local law enforcement agencies so they have a chance to respond.

Last year, Border Report reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection after Garcia released his 2024 abuse documentation report. CBP urged the complainants then to file formal complaints through official channels as soon as possible.

Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.

Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.

In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”

According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.

Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.

“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.

Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”

“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”

According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”

The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.

During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.",https://cdn3.creativecirclemedia.com/lafromboise/original/20250812-161707-539-1vets.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:57:13.513576

WASHINGTON – In the Houston, TX area alone U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 356 criminal illegal alien gang members during the first six months of the Trump administration. In the first six months of the Biden administration, just 75 gang members were arrested in the Houston, TX area. To put these figures into perspective, it’s a 375% increase in arrests of gang members under the Trump administration in this area. In 2021, the ICE Houston field office arrested 115 gang members during the entire year.

These 356 gang members were collectively convicted of 1,685 criminal offenses including murder, child sex crimes, sex trafficking, arson, and theft.

In total, ICE arrested members of more than 40 different gangs including 39 MS-13 gang members, 25 Tren de Aragua gang members, six Latin Kings gang members, 159 Paisas gang members, and 26 Tango Blast gang members.

“Thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem, these illegal alien gang members are off America’s streets. Across the country, ICE law enforcement is targeting these vicious gangs that rape, maim, and murder Americans for sport,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to dismantle transnational criminal terrorist gangs. In Houston area alone, we have already arrested more than three times as many gang members as the Biden administration arrested in Houston in all of 2021. The days of unchecked gang violence are OVER.”

“The Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,” Abbott wrote.
I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed.” Abbott called the current session with an extensive agenda that included disaster relief for floods that killed more than 130 people.

Texas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats.","Texas Republican leaders said Tuesday that they were prepared to end their stalemated special session and immediately begin another standoff with Democrats in the GOP’s efforts to redraw congressional maps as directed by President Trump.

It’s the latest indication that Trump’s push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections will become an extended standoff that promises to reach multiple statehouses controlled by both major parties.

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows confirmed the plans during a brief session Tuesday morning that marked another failure to meet the required attendance standards to conduct official business because dozens of Democrats have left the state to stymie the GOP’s partisan gerrymandering attempts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Burrows said from the House floor that lawmakers will not attempt to reconvene again until Friday. If Democrats are still absent — and they have given no indication that they plan to return — the speaker said Republicans will end the current session and Gov. Greg Abbott will immediately call another.

The governor, a Trump ally, confirmed his intentions in a statement.

“The Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,” Abbott wrote. “There will be no reprieve for the derelict Democrats who fled the state and abandoned their duty to the people who elected them. I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed.”

Abbott called the current session with an extensive agenda that included disaster relief for floods that killed more than 130 people. Democrats balked when Abbott added Trump’s redistricting idea to the agenda. Burrows on Tuesday did not mention redistricting but chided Democrats for not showing up for debate on the flood response package.

The redistricting legislation would reshape the state’s congressional districts in a design aimed at sending five more Republicans to Washington.

The scheme is part of Trump’s push to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of his first presidency, when the 2018 midterms restored Democrats to a House majority that blocked his agenda and twice impeached him. Current maps nationally put Democrats within three seats of retaking the House majority — with only several dozen competitive districts across 435 total seats.

Texas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats. Because they are out of state, those lawmakers are beyond the reach of Texas authorities.

Burrows said Tuesday that absent Democrats would have to pay for all state government costs for law enforcement officials attempting to track them down. Burrows has said state troopers and others have run up “six figures in overtime costs” trying to corral Democratic legislators.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bf2ddc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+267/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fed%2F1b0e203a942f3d3aa404f8533e53%2Fa7a8eb55acb240fb9e3778e27161ab8c,N,,2025-08-12 21:56:32.434549

As of July 15, HHS reclassified how it interprets the term “federal public benefit” under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).

In the past it meant people living in the U.S. could receive benefits under this classification, regardless of immigration status. This is no longer the case.

The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and therefore any rescission request that pauses funding after August 16 (45 days before the end of the fiscal year) would qualify as a ""pocket rescission.""
A pocket rescission is ""neither a rescission nor is it legal,"" said the Center for American Progress.
Can anyone stop a pocket rescission?","The Constitution unambiguously grants Congress the power to determine how tax dollars are spent, an uncomfortable reality for the Trump administration's efforts to unilaterally slash spending. Many of the cuts recommended by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the spring therefore needed the retroactive blessing of Congress, a process known as ""rescission."" And media reports suggest that the Trump administration is soon set to escalate its war on Congress' spending power by using something dubbed a ""pocket rescission"" to block funding without giving Congress enough time to consider the request.

What is the Trump administration trying to do?

Congress frequently rescinds money it has previously allocated for all kinds of reasons. But the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Director Russell Vought might ""employ a pocket rescission sometime before the Sept. 30 government funding deadline,"" said The Hill. Vought's plan involves using not the ordinary rescission process driven by Congress but rather section 1012 of the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. This allows the president to pause, or impound, allocated funding for 45 days. If Congress doesn't act to officially rescind the funds, the executive branch is obligated to resume the spending.

This actually happened quite recently. In July, the Republican-controlled Congress complied with the Trump administration's request to rescind $9 billion in spending, including funding for public broadcasting. While critics lambasted Congress for capitulating to the White House, the maneuver was legal. The Trump administration, however, is reportedly planning to use this provision in a way that the U.S. government has recently deemed unlawful. This so-called ""pocket rescission"" is ""when a president asks Congress to rescind (or cancel) funds very close to the end of the fiscal year,"" said the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Because ""not enough time is given to consider this request,"" the president is ""bypassing congressional authority over government funding"" and taking a knee to let the clock run down on spending he dislikes.

The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and therefore any rescission request that pauses funding after August 16 (45 days before the end of the fiscal year) would qualify as a ""pocket rescission."" The GAO is an independent, non-partisan agency located in the legislative branch that was created to ""make sure that the appropriation laws enacted by the Congress are properly implemented,"" said the American Enterprise Institute.

A pocket rescission is ""neither a rescission nor is it legal,"" said the Center for American Progress. After all, a ""loophole that allowed the president to impound funds over the will of Congress"" would ultimately ""undermine the entire intent of the law."" But the ""OMB asserts that there is nothing controversial about pocket rescissions,"" said Lawfare. The record shows ""they have been used this way before,"" and past presidents, including Jimmy Carter, employed them without being accused of precipitating constitutional crises.

Can anyone stop a pocket rescission?

During the second Trump administration, the boundaries of legality are being redrawn by the president in conjunction with a Supreme Court determined to legitimize virtually every action by the White House. This dynamic was perhaps clearest when the Supreme Court blessed the Trump administration's decision to fire Democratic members of the bipartisan National Labor Relations Board, in clear violation of congressional statute and existing Supreme Court precedent on the matter. While the Supreme Court's May decision in that case was ""technically a temporary one,"" it nevertheless ""clearly forecasts the eventual outcome of the case when it is argued before the court,"" likely sometime in 2026, said NPR.

So while pocket rescissions are of dubious legality according to widespread understandings of the U.S. Constitution as it existed prior to Trump's second inauguration, the Supreme Court seems quite unlikely to halt them. Instead, in keeping with the doctrine of the ""unitary executive theory,"" the court will almost certainly grant the Trump administration wide latitude to interpret existing law as it sees fit.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HgQyeQACUm2GyfwU7ohNdL.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:38.163935

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold fewer people in the 10th-floor holding cells of its Lower Manhattan offices at 26 Federal Plaza. ICE has been accused of detaining dozens of migrants for days or weeks there in tight quarters meant to hold detainees for just a few hours.

The judge also ordered ICE to allow migrants to place calls to their lawyers and to ensure access to proper medical and hygienic care following allegations that detainees were deprived of showers, given meager meals and forced to sleep on the concrete floor without any bedding.

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday by legal organizations representing a Peruvian immigrant, Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was arrested by ICE and held at 26 Federal Plaza last week.

Judge Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order while he fully reviews the case and considers whether to issue a longer-lasting order. ICE has repeatedly denied that the cells at 26 Federal Plaza are overcrowded or that conditions are inadequate.

The ruling is a short-term victory for immigration activists who have spent months denouncing the conditions in the holding cells. They have filled up as ICE has increased arrests in New York’s immigration courts, straining the agency’s detention capacity. Many of the more than 3,200 people ICE has arrested in the New York City area since Jan. 20, when President Trump’s second term began, have been detained at 26 Federal Plaza at some point, according to new federal data released this week.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.” Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.
“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”

It added that the government “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to undermine democracy” and specifically mentioned suppressing the speech of Bolsonaro and his supporters.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/689bbd28c97df4.24897754.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:44.415442

FITZGERALD: In June, a federal judge ruled the deployment was illegal and ordered that control be returned to California. But an appeals court disagreed and allowed Trump to maintain control. The state alleges Trump illegally used the military for domestic law enforcement. David Carrillo, a constitutional law expert at University of California, Berkeley, who filed briefs supporting the state in the case, says it could set a precedent for when the guard is deployed elsewhere.

DAVID CARRILLO: I think it is fair to say this is the most significant modern example of a court taking a hard look at the factual justifications for the exercise of federal power in this area.

FITZGERALD: Witnesses Monday recounted what the troops were doing, setting the stage for lawyers to argue whether those were law enforcement duties or not. A couple hundred National Guard troops remain. The trial is scheduled to go through Wednesday.

“Everybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles?
And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.” Raids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds.
Labor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.
Lizzet, a McDonald’s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.","Several hundred workers, organizers and immigrant advocates gathered in palm-tree-dotted MacArthur Park on Tuesday to denounce the Trump administration and immigration raids it has carried out in the city and in other parts of California.

Rows of parked cars clogged a stretch of Park View Street in the morning, blocking traffic. Scrawled on windshields and bumpers in chalky white and printed on taped signs were slogans “ICE out of LA” and “Stop the Trump terror.”

From atop a truck, Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta addressed the crowd.

“Our fight is for working people. ... It’s a fight against authoritarianism. It’s a fight to restore democracy in this country,” said Huerta, who was injured and detained by law enforcement in early June while documenting the first major immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles this summer. “Everybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles? And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.”

Raids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds. The ongoing threat to the many immigrant workers that local labor groups count among their members, as well as criminal charges of conspiracy to impede an officer brought against Huerta, have ignited protests in recent months.

Labor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.

On Tuesday, speakers urged people not to purchase from major companies including Home Depot, Walmart, Target and fast-food restaurants that they contend are not doing enough to protect their employees.

A spokesperson for Home Depot previously told The Times the company had not been notified of any of the raids at its locations ahead of time and that the company was not involved in any of the operations.

“We are going to take back MacArthur Park,” said Felipe Caceres, an organizer with SEIU 721. “For 24 hours we are reclaiming our power to stop the Trump terror. For 24 hours we are going to boycott companies.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The park, which is nestled in the heart of a dense immigrant community, has become a symbol ever since July 7, when federal agents descended on it with horses and armored vehicles, carrying rifles and in tactical gear.

“It’s important to reclaim this space, where ICE staged a show of force. So that’s what we’re here to do,” said Marissa Nuncio, executive director of the Garment Worker Center.

Local unions and labor groups have rallied to support their members in recent months.

The Garment Worker Center has worked to deliver food to garment manufacturers sheltering at home and held “Know Your Rights” trainings. As car wash workers across the region have been snapped up in raids, the CLEAN Carwash Worker Center has scrambled to track deportations and connect families with legal services.

The union representing Southern California hotel workers, Unite Here Local 11, has pressed hotel owners to push back on the Trump administration’s rhetoric and provide additional protections for the many in its workforce who are asylum seekers, immigrants with Temporary Protected Status and recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

Cooks and cashiers with the California Fast Food Workers Union this week penned a letter to fast-food businesses urging them to commit to protecting workers by barring federal agents from entering spaces that they do not have proper warrants to enter.

“Fast-food worker bosses, whose side are you guys on? Are you going to sit here and just let [the federal government] run all over us? We’re asking you today to stand up with us and protect us,” said Anneisha Williams, a member of the state’s Fast Food Council, at the Tuesday rally.

Lizzet, a McDonald’s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.

A cell phone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.
In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes and other hygiene products.
The building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.

A cell phone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes and other hygiene products. They also said they were fed inedible “slop"" and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period couldn't use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

Kaplan instructed federal immigration officials to allocate 50 square feet (4.6 square meters) per person — shrinking the capacity of the largest hold room to about 15 people, down from the 40 or more individuals that detainees said were being jammed into the rooms. The building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day, provide adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products. Addressing concerns that detainees weren't able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,"" Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” government lawyer Jeffrey S. Oestericher said, adding that he agreed “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated.”

The lawsuit — filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union — sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called “inhumane and horrifying conditions.""

Some detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza for days or even weeks before being sent to other facilities — longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, an assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that as of Monday a total of 24 people were held in the building’s four hold rooms — well shy of the city fire marshal’s 154-person cap.

Each room is equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap and teeth cleaning wipes, and feminine products, Zanello said.

Sergio Barco Mercado, the named plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing. He was subsequently transferred to an upstate New York detention facility.

Barco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the U.S. in 2022, said his hold room was “extremely crowded,"" cold and “smelled of sewage,"" and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. ""There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Another detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the U.S. when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration court hearing. Officers pressed him to self-deport, he said, and told him he’d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.

Lopez Benitez said an arresting officer showed him a cell phone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers kept the air conditioning blasting and doled out meals that “looked like dog food.""

Silver said it can be hard to say when one rally, one boycott, or one action will tip the balance.","Immigrant-rights advocates undertook a daylong “community stoppage” Tuesday with a 24-hour boycott of various businesses, plus rallies opposing federal immigration enforcement operations.

The action, which began at midnight Tuesday, was organized by several groups, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights Los Angeles, Service Employees International Union Local 721, Central American Resource Center of Los Angeles and the Garment Worker Center.

Participants were urged to join events scheduled throughout the day and to support individuals and families affected by immigration raids.

The coalition also called for a boycott of The Home Depot, Target, Walmart and fast food restaurants.

“These corporations whether implicitly or not have allowed their facilities to be used as places where federal agents violated workers’ rights and have inflicted pain and terror in our community and families,” Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesman for CHIRLA, said in an email to City News Service.

“These corporations benefit on a daily basis from our hard-earned dollars and yet remain silent in light of the attacks against Angelenos and workers,” he added.

Organizers said the boycott was aimed at showing the economic influence of immigrant communities and to demand an end to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and the expansion of private detention centers.

“This is an action that will involve supporters or our community who dislike the way the federal government is overreaching and violating workers’ due process and rights,” Cabrera said. “This community stoppage is the precursor of more actions to come later in the year calling on the federal government to stop these racist raids.”

The day of action began with a midnight fast-food workers strike at a restaurant near MacArthur Park, followed by a second walkout at 5 a.m. A “Take Back Our Park” coffee and breakfast was held early Tuesday morning at Park View and Wilshire Boulevard, followed by a 10 a.m rally at MacArthur Park involving hundreds of people.

Participants were expected Tuesday afternoon to march from MacArthur Park to the county Hall of Administration. A 5 p.m. rally was also planned at Placita Olvera (Olvera Street), followed by a march to the downtown federal detention center, where a vigil will be held.

A spokesman for The Home Depot issued a statement saying, “Immigration enforcement agencies are the best sources if you have questions. We aren’t notified that these activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

Target and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Plans for the community stoppage were announced last week at a news conference at MacArthur Park. The announcement came a day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security conducted a raid at a Home Depot on Wilshire Boulevard, where agents hid in a Penske truck and descended on day laborers at the site. ICE arrested approximately 16 individuals as a result of the raid.

Aggressive ICE raids began June 6, resulting in the arrest of 2,792 immigrants in Los Angeles County and six surrounding counties who are suspected of living in the United States without legal permission.

Homeland Security previously announced that fewer than 1,400 immigrants were arrested in the region last month.

Some immigration experts suggested the decrease was due to a federal court order limiting the scope of immigration-enforcement operations in the area.

A federal judge last month issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from stopping individuals in violation of the Fourth Amendment and requiring the government to provide detained individuals with access to counsel.

The federal government appealed the ruling, but last week, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put a stay on the ruling. The federal government has appealed the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The restraining order, however, did not prevent last Wednesday’s operation involving the Penske truck. On X, U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles Bill Essayli acknowledged the operation, writing, “For those who thought immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again. The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable, and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.”

Essayli defended the raid as being within the scope of reasonable suspicion.

CHIRLA was among groups who sued the federal government for their “roving patrols” and enforcement tactics.

“We’re so proud of the work we did to document all of the abuses that led our courts to say you do need a temporary restraining from the federal agents as they are conducting immigration enforcement throughout the Los Angeles region,” Angelica Salas, executive director for CHIRLA, previously said.

“We believe in the courts, and we believe in the Constitution, and we’re going to continue to fight in the courts because we have rights, and we’re going to affirm those rights in every way possible,” she added.

Additionally, participants in Tuesday’s community stoppage were encouraged to purchase from local street vendors and, if possible, buy them out.

“There’s so many street vendors who feel terrorized, so if you can go to your local street vendor to buy their flowers, buy their food and buy the things that they’re selling because they deserve to have an opportunity in this moment that they are suffering,” Salas said.

Ike Silver, an assistant professor of marketing at the USC Marshall School of Business, told City News Service that he was pessimistic about seeing a clear impact as a result of a single boycott on the policy of any presidential administration.

“That said, to the extend that these kinds of events can add up through time, the cumulative impact can be to draw attention, raise awareness, change public opinion in the hopes that if enough of these happen over time, there will be sort of a shift in what’s demanded of leadership of business and of government,” Silver told CNS.

According to Silver, success of the boycott can be measured differently depending on the goals of the organizers.

“So my sense is that a 24-hour boycott is not likely to change Home Depot’s bottom line all that much in and of itself, but if it activates Angelenos who might otherwise not be paying attention or not be aware of Home Depot’s, or other businesses connection to this issue, then that can be sort of a different success metric, such that those people might demand action,” Silver said.

Silver said it can be hard to say when one rally, one boycott, or one action will tip the balance.

“In the context of something like the Civil Rights Movement, it’s hard to say which boycott, which sit-in, which march was the one that changed things, but we can see that in aggregate over the course of history these kinds of actions do take effect — and so there’s an element of keeping faith,” Silver told CNS.",https://mynewsla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_1268966-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:58.669489

UC Riverside’s findings come amid reports of immigration enforcement activity on or near school grounds in the wake of policy changes allowing these actions under President Donald Trump.
In January, the Trump administration changed longstanding DHS policy to allow enforcement action on school grounds and other “protected areas,” which were previously considered safe from ICE raids.
That incident, which happened off of school grounds, was at least the third known time Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time.
Multiple lawsuits have been filed to challenge that policy change, including one as recently as July.","Dive Brief:

The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies — which include allowing enforcement on school grounds, prolonged and increased immigration detention, and ambiguity around who may be targeted — are having “ripple effects” on immigrant children and children who are U.S. citizens living in mixed-status families, according to a new report from psychiatric researchers.

Chronic anxiety over detention or deportation is linked to absenteeism, classroom disengagement and heightened emotional distress, leading students “to avoid school or withdraw from public life.”

The July report calls schools “critical sites for early identification and support” but added they can also be places where immigrant youth “experience trauma-related avoidance, disengagement, or behavioral challenges.”

Dive Insight:

Students impacted by the current administration’s immigration policies face academic decline and social isolation, in addition to missing out on developmental supports that include access to trusted adults and school-based mental health services, per the report.

The researchers from University of California, Riverside and New York University suggest students may benefit from schools adopting trauma-informed practices, curbing punitive discipline, and ensuring students receive mental health support with special considerations for immigration-related issues.

UC Riverside’s findings come amid reports of immigration enforcement activity on or near school grounds in the wake of policy changes allowing these actions under President Donald Trump.

In January, the Trump administration changed longstanding DHS policy to allow enforcement action on school grounds and other “protected areas,” which were previously considered safe from ICE raids. However, DHS has since clarified that it expects enforcement activity in schools to be “extremely rare.”

In April, officers from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to enter two elementary schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, saying that they were conducting ”wellness checks.″ The officers reportedly made false claims that they had parents’ permission to speak with the students.

This month, ICE apprehended a parent during morning student drop-off hours in California’s Chula Vista Elementary School District while two children were reportedly in the car at the time of the arrest. That incident, which happened off of school grounds, was at least the third known time Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time.

“In this context, emotional distress becomes both an understandable and adaptive response to a life shaped by surveillance and exclusion,” the UC Riverside report said. “These dynamics underscore that immigration policy does not operate solely as a legal system—it functions as a structural determinant of health.”

The report confirms school leaders’ concerns that recent immigration policies are negatively impacting families and students, creating environments of fear and, in some cases, leading to absenteeism.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed to challenge that policy change, including one as recently as July.

Denver Public Schools became the first school district to challenge the policy, saying in a February lawsuit that the Trump administration had created fear in students and families and led to a noticeable drop in school attendance across the district — particularly in schools with immigrant families.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3jfwuIvOgm52XyEnORvxzsp1O_GN6cj59Krr3SUUCWA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI3NDE2ODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-12 19:56:50.650961

The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s move to deploy 800 National Guard members in the District of Columbia over claims that crime is plaguing the city – despite historic lows – follows his use of the military in his administration's growing immigration crackdown.

“(D.C.’s) out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border,” Trump said at a Monday press conference where he was flanked by members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He vowed to do the same in more cities governed by Democrats.

Trump’s return to the White House was led by a campaign promise of mass deportations, tying newly arrived immigrants at the southern border with high crime rates and the need to use troops to detain and remove those migrants.

Since Inauguration Day, the president has sent thousands of National Guard members to be stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border and has militarized strips of land along the border, putting migrants into contact with military personnel.

Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard in June in response to unrest over immigration raids was seen as a test case for use of the state-based military forces. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California wrote on X on Monday that Trump “was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles” with that order.

“He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America,” Newsom said. “This is what dictators do.”

‘Quick Reaction Force’

Now the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

The groups, who would be armed with riot gear and other weapons, would be split evenly between Alabama and Arizona, according to the Post.

The DOD proposal also calls for a rotation of service members from Army and Air Force National Guard units based in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the Post.

National Guard members are typically in reserve and are some of the first responders to natural disasters.

The Department of Defense and the National Guard did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment about the “Quick Reaction Force” plans. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Which cities are next?

At the Monday press conference, Trump specifically cited four cities that could see similar National Guard movements: Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors. Violent crime in all those cities has continued to trend downward, according to each city's police database.

Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, New York City and the entire state of California also all are on a new “sanctuary jurisdiction” list issued by the Department of Justice on Aug. 5. They are identified as “having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

But, unlike the district, where the president has control over the National Guard, state governors, under the law, have had control over their National Guard members.

Additionally, while Trump has seized control of the 3,400 officers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department for 29 days due to the district's Home Rule Act, experts don’t see how that can legally be done with other local police departments.

“What they are doing in D.C. cannot be replicated outside of D.C. All of this is only possible because D.C. is not a state,” said Joseph Nunn, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. “There's no playbook for them to do what they seem to want to do outside of D.C.”

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Trump’s statements about sending in National Guard members into cities.

“The president is speaking about what he’d like to see take place in other cities across the country,” she said. “When the time comes we’ll talk about that. Starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin and it should serve as a model.”

Trump said he hoped other cities were “watching.”

“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.

Nunn said that even if the president were to federalize a state’s National Guard, those members would be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

“There is no statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that allows the military to participate in local law enforcement,” Nunn said.

Los Angeles

A trial is underway this week challenging the president’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.

The president deployed 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles after protests erupted against aggressive immigration actions by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting raids in Home Depot parking lots.

But the legal issue before a San Francisco court is not if the president’s actions were unlawful, but on the political question of who has authority over the National Guard.

Other governors in the states Trump mentioned as candidates for National Guard activation pushed back on the notion.

Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, said in a statement that the president’s decision to call in the National Guard to the District of Columbia “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”

Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the president could not send in the National Guard to Chicago.

“Let’s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” he said.

The conflict between Trump and the Democrats comes at the same time Newsom has threatened to launch a redistricting of California’s congressional districts in order to nullify Texas’ attempt to redraw maps to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.

And Pritzker is hosting in Illinois the Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session for redistricting.

Since taking office for his second term, the president has signed five executive orders that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up Trump’s immigration crackdown.

More funding also soon will be at hand for Trump’s mass deportations. The massive tax and spending cut bill enacted in July has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown. It bolsters border security, increases immigration detention capacity and adds fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.

Some Republican governors have agreed to deploy their own National Guard members to aid the Trump administration in immigration enforcement, such as in Iowa and Tennessee. The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.

Nunn said that while it’s not typically normal for states to use National Guard members for local policing there is some precedent, such as when New York had members stationed in the New York City subway.

“What is unprecedented is the federal government using military personnel for sort of crime prevention, for regular policing,” Nunn said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/nationalguarddc.jpg?h=6eff8031&itok=1Y4cZBEi,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:48.777357

Testifying before Congress, Lutnick has faced questions from lawmakers about his position on who should be counted in the census.
In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the commerce secretary to follow a once-a-decade census schedule.
The press offices for the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, and the White House did not immediately respond to NPR's inquiries.","Less than a week after President Trump said he has ordered a ""new"" census,"" the cabinet official who oversees the Census Bureau acknowledged Tuesday that Congress, not the president, has final say over the national head count that's used to reshape election maps and guide federal funding, NPR has exclusively learned.

Speaking at a town-hall event for the bureau's employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that when tallying the country's population, the census should differentiate people living in the U.S. without legal status from other residents, according to three Census Bureau employees, who asked NPR not to name them because they fear retaliation.

Lutnick said if a person has ""broken into the country,"" they need to be counted in the census, but they should be counted as someone who has ""broken into the country,"" the three employees confirmed to NPR.

Lutnick's remarks come amid a Republican-led campaign to use census data to redraw congressional voting maps in Texas and other states ahead of next year's midterm election in an attempt to maintain GOP control of the House of Representatives.

Amid this rare mid-decade redistricting push, Trump, Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and some GOP lawmakers in Congress have floated conducting a census before the next scheduled count in 2030 so that new results can be used to redistribute House seats among the states and redraw maps of congressional voting districts — all before the 2026 election.

Lutnick acknowledged legal hurdles facing any census before 2030

Given the short timeline, census experts have dismissed the idea of a 2025 or 2026 census as practically impossible. It usually takes the bureau more than a decade to prepare a count, and planning for the upcoming 2030 census began six years ago.

Lutnick's comments on Tuesday mark the first known acknowledgement by a top Trump administration official of the potential legal hurdles facing any attempt to carry out the president's census call.

The remarks also appear to reference Trump's Aug. 7 social media post calling for the U.S. census to, for the first time in the country's history, exclude people without legal status.

The 14th Amendment requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be counted in the 2030 census apportionment numbers, which are set to be used to determine each state's new share of House seats and Electoral College votes.

Testifying before Congress, Lutnick has faced questions from lawmakers about his position on who should be counted in the census. During his Senate confirmation hearing in February, Lutnick told Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii: ""Since the first sentence of the 14th Amendment of that clause says we will count each whole person, I promise you we will count each whole person. That's what the Constitution says. And we will stick right to it rigorously.""

But asked in June by Republican Rep. Dale Strong of Alabama about his thoughts on ""consistency from state to state not allowing non-U.S. citizens to be counted"" in the census, Lutnick said: ""Consistency makes sense.""

Some Republicans are still pushing for a census before the 2026 midterms

Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to carry out a national tally ""in such Manner as they shall by Law direct."" In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the commerce secretary to follow a once-a-decade census schedule. That federal law also allows for a mid-decade census in 2025, but it can't be used to redistribute House seats and a legal deadline to prepare for such a count has already passed.

Still, Trump said in the social media post that he instructed the Commerce Department to ""immediately begin work"" on a ""new"" census that excludes people living in the states without legal status. Trump has not clarified whether his post was referring to the 2030 census or an earlier one.

Hours after Trump's census call, the Commerce Department said in a statement that the Census Bureau ""will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data"" and ""accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

The department replied with that same statement when asked by NPR on Tuesday whether Lutnick has communicated to the White House his position on Congress' authority over the census and whether the commerce secretary plans to propose adding a census question about a person's immigration status, which the bureau has yet to test.

The press offices for the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, and the White House did not immediately respond to NPR's inquiries.

Trump has publicly backed a proposal by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to change current federal law and allow for a new census, redistribution of House seats and a new round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election.

Greene's bill also calls for excluding not only people without legal status, but all people living in the states without U.S. citizenship, such as green card holders, from what the 14th Amendment requires to be the ""whole number of persons in each state.""

Last week, Republican Rep. Randy Fine of Florida, introduced a similar proposal. Together, both bills currently have less than a handful of sponsors and are stuck in committee.

On Monday, another Republican official from Florida weighed in on the census with a letter to Lutnick referencing Trump's ""recent census directive"" by social media post.

Florida's state Attorney General James Uthmeier — a former Trump administration official who helped come up with a failed plan to exclude people without legal status from the 2020 census apportionment numbers — made two proposals.

Uthmeier suggested states get new shares of House seats before the 2026 midterm election based on a census ""recount"" in areas of states that the Census Bureau estimates it over- or undercounted in 2020. He also proposed ""correcting"" the census data used to guide trillions in federal funding for public services in communities with those miscounting estimates. The bureau's researchers and an internal watchdog have raised concerns about the usability of those estimates.

""We are energized by President Trump's leadership,"" Uthmeier wrote, ""and we look forward to hearing from you and working together to resolve these issues.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbe%2Fcd3a700c4718b0bbab36ddb64f36%2Fgettyimages-2197465985.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:50.549900

It stated: “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” In last year’s report, the state department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.","Donald Trump’s administration has significantly changed a key US government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president, such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have well-established histories of abuses.

Instead, the US state department sounded an alarm about what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues.

Criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”.

The report’s section on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023.

The report was delayed for months as Trump appointees altered an earlier state department draft dramatically to bring it in line with “America First” values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, “Liberty” and “Security of the Person”.

“There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” the 2024 report said about El Salvador, in sharp contrast with the 2023 report that talked about “significant human rights issues” and listed them as credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.

Washington’s bilateral ties with El Salvador have strengthened since Trump took office, as the administration has deported people to El Salvador with help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house the migrants in a high-security mega-prison.

The Trump administration has moved away from the traditional US promotion of democracy and human rights, seeing it as interference in another country’s affairs, even as it criticized countries selectively, consistent with its broader policy towards a particular country.

One example is Europe, where Trump officials repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they see as suppression of rightwing leaders, including in Romania, Germany and France, and accused European authorities of censoring views such as criticism of immigration.

For decades, the state department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

This year’s report was prepared after a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in April wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists”, saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”.

In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the state department found the human rights situation declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, among others.

Bolsonaro is on trial before the supreme court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 presidential election loss to the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Trump has referred to the case as a “witch-hunt” and called it grounds for a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods.

In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened. It stated: “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

August 12, 2025 4:40 pm

NEW YORK – In a win for immigrants’ rights, a U.S. District Court granted a temporary restraining order today that would improve conditions for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 26 Federal Plaza. Notably, the order prohibits ICE from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order would also require ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats and access to medical care, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

The order comes just days after the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP filed a class action lawsuit over the abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza. The order will remain in place for at least 14 days while the judge considers longer-term relief.

Quotes from co-counsel are as follows:

“Today’s order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” said Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project. ""We’ll continue to fight to ensure that peoples’ rights are upheld at 26 Federal Plaza and beyond.”

Harold Solis, Co-Legal Director of Make the Road New York, said, ""We welcome the decision by Judge Kaplan to place clear limits on the disturbing and unlawful conditions to which immigrants have been subjected at 26 Federal Plaza. This ruling sends a hopeful message, one that reinforces what everyone knows to be true: ICE cannot confine people in inhumane conditions, nor can it obstruct their access to counsel. We will remain vigilant to ensure ICE complies with the court’s order.”

“The conditions and lack of attorney access at 26 Federal Plaza have been horrifying and unconscionable,” said Heather Gregorio of Wang Hecker LLP. “Judge Kaplan’s Temporary Restraining Order imposes basic accountability on ICE and requires that it meet constitutional standards, as all human beings deserve.”

“The Constitution requires that no one — especially someone unlawfully arrested at their immigration hearing, which happened to so many people in this case — should have to endure the dehumanizing conditions we've challenged in 26 Federal Plaza,"" said Bobby Hodgson, Assistant Legal Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “We look forward to continuing this fight and stopping ICE's unconstitutional detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza for good.”

Festivals take a stand Another way Connecticut Puerto Ricans have spoken out against ICE is with their dollars.
And when we say community, it's not just a Puerto Rican community, it's the New Haven community,” Rodriguez said.","The week President Trump was inaugurated, Connecticut’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus spoke out against what they say is racial profiling of Latino communities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Over the summer, reggaeton artist Bad Bunny publicly shamed ICE after witnessing a detainment on the island. And Wesleyan alum and legendary Nuyorican Lin Manuel Miranda recently turned the 10th anniversary of his Broadway hit “Hamilton” into a fundraiser for immigrants.

Here in Connecticut, Puerto Ricans are increasingly standing with their fellow Latinos against the immigration crackdown.

When a New Haven high schooler from Guatemala was detained by ICE in July, it wasn’t just Latinos who came out to the rally for his return.

Rev. Nathan Empsall is the priest-in-charge at St. Paul and St. James Episcopal Church in Wooster Square. He says attendance at the food pantry and clothing closet the church partners with is down in recent weeks, and volunteers say it’s because of fears of ICE.

“If this was about enforcing justice and laws like the authoritarians tell us,” he told rallygoers, “they wouldn't arrest people outside courthouses, they wouldn't target Puerto Rican neighborhoods, and they wouldn't be arresting our 11th graders.”

Empsall says he was referring to cases reported in similar communities, like the detainment of a Puerto Rican veteran in Newark in January and the presence of a dozen ICE agents outside of a Puerto Rican museum in Chicago in July.

In a statement to Connecticut Public, ICE Boston spokesperson James Covington said “these rumors only serve to cause fear and incite violence toward our brave officers.” He said the idea that ICE is targeting Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the state is “not only ludicrous and dangerous, but completely false.”

“What I find as ludicrous and dangerous is the racial profiling that is happening right now and that is being advanced by ICE,” said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.

Matos is Puerto Rican and has lived and worked as an advocate in Connecticut for over two decades.

“I will tell you personally that I have fielded a number of phone calls from Puerto Ricans asking me if they should carry their passports because they're planning to head to Puerto Rico, and they're afraid of the experience that they will have and the possibility that they will be stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” she said.

Why? Because of Newark, Chicago, the Puerto Rican restaurant that was raided in Philadelphia, the Puerto Rican family that was detained while out shopping in Milwaukee.

“There are examples throughout the entire country of Puerto Ricans being detained. That is why Puerto Ricans, Latinos, brown and Black people are afraid,” Matos said. “Even when they benefit from US citizenship, that does not stop the level of fear.”

Concerns spread at celebrations

Fear was a real concern for Elba and Carmelo Valle at the Salsa Meets Jazz Festival in downtown Hartford. Half of their Puerto Rican friend group headed to Parkville Market afterward to keep the party going. But that day, during a Peruvian festival at the market, a rumor started to spread that ICE was there and arresting folks.

“Who knows where it can happen?” Elba said. “And then, if we see that, it's just the anger. It's really anger. It's not right. It's not right the way they're going about it, I don't think.”

Carmelo brought up a common argument against the recent deportations: ICE is separating families.

“Yeah,” Elba agreed, “they're separating families. It's heartbreaking.”

At Parkville Market, it turns out EMS was just responding to a medical emergency that day. But the fear that any official in uniform could be ICE increasingly keeps many Latinos home — and some Puerto Ricans questioning what their role is in all this.

“What can we do?” Elba said. “What can we do but get closer together? You know what I'm saying? Come as a community and as a family to, you know, at least try to help out.”

Officials ‘call out’ the targeting of Latinos

The National Puerto Rican Agenda released a statement that reads, in part, “As a national organization rooted in the Puerto Rican diaspora, we know firsthand the importance of family unity, community stability, and the struggle for dignity and inclusion. Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, we will not remain silent while our immigrant brothers and sisters are dehumanized.”

Connecticut State Rep. Christopher Rosario echoes that sentiment. He’s a member of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus and represents many Puerto Ricans in Bridgeport.

“Even though we — quote, unquote — shouldn't have anything to worry about, as we are citizens, Puerto Rico always gets second class treatment from the federal government, so it's just no different,” Rosario said.

Rosario says he’s heard the reports, too, of U.S Citizens being detained, even if briefly, in other states.

“And anytime there's an incident where there's a Puerto Rican, or anyone, for that matter, that's detained or held by ICE, we must call it out and work with our federal authorities to make sure this doesn't happen,” he said.

Festivals take a stand

Another way Connecticut Puerto Ricans have spoken out against ICE is with their dollars.

Avelo Airlines is one of the cheapest ways to fly direct from New Haven to San Juan to visit loved ones on the island. But after Avelo signed up to run deportation flights for the Trump administration, pro-immigrant protesters and the group Puerto Ricans United came out against the decision. Joe Rodriguez is the president of PRU and a vice president at the National Puerto Rican Agenda.

“We're community first. And when we say community, it's not just a Puerto Rican community, it's the New Haven community,” Rodriguez said. “And when our brothers and sisters are reaching out to us for support, we need to be there, because they have been there for us in our time of need: be it Hurricane Maria and other natural disasters where our community has partnered with us.”

PRU puts on New Haven’s Puerto Rican festival each year, and for the last two, Avelo has been a sponsor of the event. This year PRU’s board voted unanimously to cut ties.

“We felt it only right, given who we are as an organization, our values and what we stand for, to stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters and say before we even engage in conversations, we're going to just nip it in the bud now and say, ‘No, we're not going to do it,’” he said.

In an emailed statement to NPR, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy called the decision to run deportation flights “a sensitive and complicated topic.”

""After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 Crewmembers employed for years to come,” he said.

Rodriguez says he knows many Puerto Ricans are now willing to go out of their way — driving to other airports and spending more money — to avoid supporting a contractor for deportation flights.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b1a072/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F48%2Fc2%2Ff0d1a711471bac6fb31ffa382153%2F250611-newhaveniceprotest-ab23426xxx.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:57:05.546658

Vehicles that appear to be from ICE are also lined up near school property lines, though not on the school's property itself.

People First Project, which tracks ICE encounters around the Valley, said the student was walked to school by the agent after their guardian was detained by ICE.

Roosevelt School District, which operates Southwest School, said it was aware of ICE's presence last week and was ""actively monitoring the situation,"" noting it had not been contacted by any immigration enforcement agencies.

“We understand how deeply concerning these reports may be for many of our families,” Dr. Ashley Hodge, President of Roosevelt School District Governing Board, said in a statement shared with ABC15. “On behalf of our entire Board, we want to assure you that the safety, dignity, and well-being of every student and family remain at the heart of our mission.”

On Monday, parents at the school were surprised to learn about the operation.

""That's kind of strange to me,"" Mark Childress, whose son attends preschool at Southwest, said. ""I think certain places are sacred ground... kids should feel safe coming to school.""

It's unclear how many people were detained during the operation, which took place around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, on the second day of school. People First Project said as many as three people were pulled over and potentially detained by ICE.

Clarissa Vela, founder of People First Project, says the group keeps its eye on ICE activity as a way to ensure agents are following the law.

""We're not anti-police, we just want to make sure that people are being treated fairly and their rights are not being violated,"" she said.

Vela said monitors in her group have witnessed ICE running plates at schools and picking up parents who were going through the legal immigration process. Vela said her group was unsure what, if any, crimes the guardians of the Southwest students were being accused of.

People First Project has seen an uptick in interactions with ICE near schools recently, with Vela saying she was aware of about 40 cases in the last week.

ICE's ability to conduct operations around schools is a change made in the last few months.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security memo sent out on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration rescinded a policy stopping ICE from detaining people and conducting immigration operations in ""sensitive"" areas such as churches and schools. The guidance was put in place during President Joe Biden's administration.

Phil Ortega, an Arizona immigration attorney, views the decision to drop the sensitive area policy as an attempt to intimidate immigrants into engaging in public life.

""My personal opinion was that the recission of that policy was just a way to strike fear into the community and cause individuals that would normally feel safe to, you know, send their kids to school or to go to churches,"" Ortega said. ""This would discourage them from doing those things.""

With classes back in session and an increased federal emphasis on boosting ICE detention numbers, both Ortega and People First Project expect to see more ICE activity near schools.

ABC15 reached out to DHS to find out more about what crime the people at Southwest School had been accused of. DHS said it couldn't share more information about the operation or the individuals involved unless ABC15 could identify the individuals.

Arizona Superintendent Tom Horne declined to comment on the operation, saying it was between the district and ICE.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c6b1c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/854x448+0+16/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2Fbd5%2F5c3d34b8b29a45469a86c02775b7a2cf%2Fbd5c9620b4e048db9d6e59a6acf7eff8%2Fposter_7c414f421a8b44d8a894f0d4470c56d7.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:57:09.930907

Kim Reynolds says 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers will be deployed to offer ""administrative and logistical support"" to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement beginning in September.

Reynolds announced the mission on Tuesday, Aug. 12. The mission is a response to a request by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and will begin Sept. 8.

""Just as we supported Texas when the Biden Administration left them to defend the border, Iowa will continue to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws — this time, by working with the Trump Administration to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in our state,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""By providing administrative and logistical support, the Iowa National Guard will free up local ICE officials to continue their work outside the office to enforce the law and keep our state safe.""

Reynolds said Aug. 6 in Cedar Rapids that the Iowa National Guard was ready to ""step up and help"" ICE with logistics and other administrative tasks, but at that time no agreement had been finalized.

Now, Reynolds said the U.S. Secretary of Defense has authorized the use of the 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers under Title 32 of the federal code, which means the soldiers will be on active duty under state, rather than federal control, but the federal government will cover their pay and benefits.

The mission is approved through Nov. 15.

National Guard mission latest step Reynolds has taken on immigration

The National Guard mission is the latest step Reynolds has taken to direct state officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

This spring, the Iowa Department of Public Safety signed what's known as a 287(g) agreement with ICE to deputize a three-member DPS task force to carry out some federal immigration enforcement functions, including arresting and interrogating people who are in violation of federal immigration laws.

Reynolds also filed a complaint with the Iowa attorney general's office alleging that Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx violated Iowa law with a Facebook post discouraging law enforcement to cooperate with ""detainer"" requests from federal immigration officials if they weren't approved by a judge.

Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Marx, but later dropped the lawsuit. Winneshiek County does comply with ICE detainer requests, despite Marx's post.

In past years, Reynolds has deployed Iowa National Guard soldiers and Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border to assist Texas with immigration enforcement efforts.

Immigrant rights groups criticize National Guard mission

Immigrant rights groups have criticized Reynolds' support for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts and now the Iowa National Guard's participation in immigration enforcement.

""Using Iowa troopers against Iowa communities will not stand,"" said Alejandra Escobar, an organizer with Escucha Mi Voz Iowa, said during an Aug. 5 rally in Cedar Rapids.

Joe Henry, Iowa state political director for the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa, said using National Guard troops for immigration enforcement will cause more problems than solutions and Reynolds should focus on more serious issues.

""Gov. Reynolds’ plan is a misuse of Iowa’s resources. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility not the job of Iowans in our state,"" Henry said in a statement Aug. 11. ""The governor should be putting her efforts toward the real problems we’re facing in Iowa like climbing cancer rates, the second-worst economy in the nation, poor access to health care and dangerous levels of water pollutants in our rivers.""

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it’s not a threat to one country, it’s a threat that’s growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.
“It’s very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.
As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.’s mass deportation agenda.
At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups.","On the final day of the Second Pan-American Congress this month, more than 60 delegates from 12 countries made their way into the Secretary of Public Education headquarters in downtown Mexico City. As leaders from the Americas walked through the building’s passages and patios, many stopped to take pictures in front of the walls lined with murals from famous artists, including Diego Rivera.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site served as the location of the final plenary of the three-day gathering aimed at uniting progressive and democratic forces in the Western hemisphere to take on rising far right authoritarianism.

Delegates representing communities from as far as Nunavut in Canada to the extreme southern tip of South America eventually took their seats in the Ibero-American Hall, a space adorned with a massive, nearly 1,500-square-foot mural, appropriately called “The Union of Latin America” by Roberto Montenegro.

From this hall, the message from Mexico was unambiguous: The peoples and the elected representatives of this hemisphere are ready to act to confront the global threat of fascism.

“We are of course facing an authoritarian threat in the world: it is the return of fascist positions to power,” María José Pizarro, a Colombian senator from the ruling Pacto Historico coalition, told Truthout. “In the face of this, we must therefore build joint strategies that allow us to confront it in the best possible way in countries where this is already happening, and in those where it is not, to prevent the return of this type of government.”

When it comes to hemispheric relations, U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued what has been described as a “divide and conquer” strategy, leveraging the national interests of one country against another and pitting neighbors against each other in order to squeeze out concessions from leaders. Trump has been able to follow this strategy to varying degrees of success, in part due to the lack of unity regarding the threat he represents to the entire world.

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it’s not a threat to one country, it’s a threat that’s growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.

From the Atlas Network, a coalition of right-wing think tanks and advocacy groups that promote neoliberal policies globally, to Trump’s open and blatant interference inside Brazil in order to back his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, in the face of charges over his effort to carry out a coup after losing the 2022 election, the far right has been successful in building trans-national links.

One aim of the Pan-American Congress is to break down barriers between progressives and anti-fascists who have historically lacked an institutional space to better coordinate their own regional response.

One standout feature of this gathering was the participation of elected representatives from the United States, including Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Illinois), Delia Ramírez (D-Illinois), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan); Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs), such as interim New Democratic Party leader Don Davies, Leah Gazan, and Lori Idlout; and MPs from the governing Liberals, such as Michael Coteau, also attended.

Pizarro, who is also a potential candidate for Colombia’s 2026 presidential election, described the participation of U.S. and Canadian lawmakers at the Pan-American Congress as “fundamental” and expressed optimism that this would be the beginning of a closer relationship with progressives in North America.

“We don’t see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all,” said Pizarro. “We rarely have the opportunity to listen to each other, to talk, especially today when the United States government is speaking out strongly about its position on Latin America, its relationship with Latin America, and that conversation with progressive Democratic congressmembers, of course, must be strengthened,” she added.

The enthusiasm for building closer ties goes both ways.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she drew inspiration from her conversations with other lawmakers fighting for their communities and the power of connecting with fellow activists across the Americas.

Tlaib drew parallels from her experience growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in a neighborhood impacted by corporate pollution with the stories she heard from colleagues at the congress from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.

“These corporations don’t care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing,” said Tlaib.

But now she says she feels “less alone in this fight against corporate greed, against corporate polluters, against those that don’t care about our communities thriving.”

Tlaib cited her conversations with Canadian MPs about the need to collaborate in the fight against the environmental threat posed by the Line 5 pipeline that threatens water systems in both the U.S. and Canada.

“We are now building these bridges and creating a movement that brings all of us together and understanding that connectivity,” Tlaib told Truthout.

Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman to serve in U.S. Congress and an important voice on the global stage speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, also expressed gratitude at the centering of the Palestinian people’s cause at the gathering. At every event over the course of the weekend, speakers spoke up in support of Palestine in no uncertain terms, firmly expressing their solidarity.

“It’s very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.

Coming on the heels of July’s Emergency Conference on Palestine, which likewise saw world leaders gather to take action in an attempt to halt the genocide, delegates at the congress said recognizing the state of Palestine was only a starting point.

“In our view, much deeper actions, much more forceful voices — and of course, the role being played by multilateral organizations, which have been stripped of their value and the ability to defend life in the face of the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian people — are essential,” said Pizarro.

Meanwhile, Colombian Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir argued that countries with progressive governments have no choice but to break diplomatic relations with Israel.

In addition to calling for an end to the genocide against the Palestinian people, participants in the conference discussed Trump’s human rights violations against migrants and refugees, and the need to confront climate change.

During his speech at the opening session, Mexican Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña said the two defining features of the rising fascist threat in the world were the suffering inflicted on Palestinians and the abuse of migrants by the U.S.

“It is an unjust, vile, incorrect persecution where, by virtue of being a migrant, or the color of your skin or your nationality, people are persecuted,” said Noroña.

The mistreatment of migrants is the clearest case study on the necessity of confronting fascism in the Americas. Trump has leaned on allies like El Salvador’s far right President Nayib Bukele, who infamously agreed to detain more than 230 Venezuelan migrants sent from the U.S. in his notorious mega-prison before negotiations between Caracas and Washington eventually secured their release.

Mexico in particular has faced enormous pressure from both U.S. political parties to crack down on migrants transiting through its territory as they try to reach the United States. More recently, the Mexican government has had to face down repeated tariff threats from Trump over the issue of migration.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has explicitly declined to become a third-country destination for non-Mexican asylum seekers and has resisted U.S. efforts to impose such arrangements. As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.’s mass deportation agenda.

The selection of Mexico City as the host of the Second Pan-American Congress (the first having been held last year in Bogotá, Colombia) offered delegates the opportunity to learn from the political project known locally as the “Fourth Transformation,” the leftist national political project to shift Mexico to a post-neoliberal model that began with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in 2018 and continued under President Sheinbaum.

With the election of Sheinbaum in 2024, Mexico proved to be one of the few countries that bucked a trend in which voters ousted incumbents and replaced them, in many cases, with right-wing populists, such as Javier Milei in Argentina.

Sheinbaum, who has been lauded for repeatedly standing up to Trump, welcomed delegates at the National Palace, allowing representatives from throughout the hemisphere to share their experiences resisting the U.S. president — and also to share firsthand how Mexico has been able to not only navigate an intemperate neighbor, but also continue to press forward with its anti-neoliberal political agenda.

Canadian MP Leah Gazan, a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation who represents Winnipeg in Canada’s House of Commons, said her time in Mexico left her feeling renewed and hopeful.

“What’s happened in Mexico is so inspiring … and to see women, progressive women, strong women, leading the narrative about the importance of humanizing politics, the importance of rooting democracy and human rights, is a refreshing change from what we’re witnessing in Canada right now,” Gazan told Truthout.

“I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from the Global South,” said Gazan.

The challenge facing elected representatives now is translating the positive experiences from the congress in Mexico into action in their home countries.

During a Pan-American Congress event at the Esperanza Iris Theatre in Mexico City, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar renewed her pledge to fight for marginalized communities throughout the hemisphere from her place inside the U.S. Congress, signaling to the peoples of the Global South that they have an ally in her.

“Since being in the elected office, I’ve made an effort to set myself apart as somebody who sees the global community as one, someone who understands our destinies and our fates are intertwined, someone who understands that being in the United States provides us with great privileges but also with responsibilities,” Omar told Truthout.

Omar has repeatedly expressed her solidarity with the Global South, especially Latin America, by participating in an on-the-ground delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in 2022, and through numerous legislative initiatives focusing on migration and human rights.

The U.S. representative also shared her view that progressives in the U.S., especially those in elected office, have an elevated duty to end U.S. policies that harm people throughout the world, saying, “It is our policies that are actively responsible for sanctions, for militarization, for exploitation, and it is up to us to make sure that we are lifting our voices collectively to say, ‘No, there is another way.’”

Trump’s aggressive approach to relations with his neighbors in the region may have caught many somewhat off guard, but more than six months into his second term, leaders from this hemisphere have now adapted and are forming new united strategies to take on Trump.

At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups. From efforts to advance an explicit recognition of systemic racism throughout the Americas, to calls for a new global order based on human dignity and solidarity among nations, there was widespread consensus on the need for stronger international cooperation to confront the global rise of fascism, denouncing its role in migrant persecution in the U.S., and the genocide in Gaza.

With the next Pan-American Congress set to take place in Uruguay next year, delegates such as Omar and Tlaib expressed a sense of hope and optimism that the gathering in Mexico City will serve as a turning point.

“There is nothing like our sisters down south and what they deal with, but [they] continuously find joy in the work that they do on behalf of the communities they serve, and that is inspiring and I’ll take that with me,” concluded Omar.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/030825_Clausura_Congreso_Panamericano-27.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 16:56:38.343319

Using other assumptions, Mr. Camarota is able to estimate the illegal immigrant population from the CPS data.
Mr. Camarota said the total U.S. population could decline this year, for the first time since the 1930s.
It’s possible that the foreign-born, illegal immigrants in particular, are now lying and claiming to be U.S.-born legal residents.
It’s also possible that some households with illegal immigrants have stopped responding to the CPS, which could affect the numbers.","President Trump is booting out illegal immigrants faster than President Biden added them, according to the latest Census Bureau numbers, which show an unprecedented drop in the number of immigrants living in the U.S.

The total number of foreign-born people dropped by 2.2 million from January to July, and most of that — 1.6 million — was among the illegal immigrant population, said Steven A. Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies who crunched the numbers.

It’s an almost unfathomable turnaround from the Biden years, when illegal immigrants surged into the U.S. at record rates, netting about 120,000 new people each month.

Over the past six months, though, the illegal immigrant population has been dropping at nearly 270,000 a month, or more than twice the rate of increase under Mr. Biden.

“The best evidence we have is that the illegal population is now falling at a rate that even exceeds the massive growth that we had in Biden’s four years,” Mr. Camarota said.

The decline coincides with a massive effort by the Trump administration, which is increasing formal arrests and deportations and has invested heavily in machinery to try to encourage illegal immigrants to leave on their own.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that foreign leaders in the hemisphere tell her they are seeing a wave of people arriving in their countries after having left the U.S.

“Over and over again, I’m hearing that hundreds of thousands of their citizens are coming home, voluntarily,” she said.

The new data comes from the Current Population Survey, a monthly Census Bureau report that is used to produce data such as the monthly unemployment figures. One of its questions prods respondents to reveal where they were born, which produces the overall immigration number.

In January, it stood at 53.3 million, an all-time high in sheer number and as a percentage of the total population.

Last month, it dipped below 51.1 million.

Using other assumptions, Mr. Camarota is able to estimate the illegal immigrant population from the CPS data. He figures that rose from 10.2 million at the start of the Biden years to 15.8 million in January, before tumbling to 14.2 million now.

Not all the illegal immigrants went home. Some are part of the normal churn of migration, such as gaining legal status or dying. That was true for the Biden years as well.

Mr. Camarota said most of those who left were likely newcomers from the Biden years or were otherwise less rooted in the U.S., and thus it was easier to pick up and leave.

That could presage diminishing returns for Mr. Trump’s enforcement push.

The implications of the drop are massive.

Mr. Camarota said the total U.S. population could decline this year, for the first time since the 1930s.

The natural net increase from births is about 500,000. If the U.S. has already shed more than 2 million people, that would easily swamp the births.

Mr. Camarota said the decline gives communities breathing space after the increases of the Biden years.

“It’s likely that this represents a savings in money for the taxpayer,” he said. “It will take pressure off schools and hospitals and other services. It’s likely it will potentially create job opportunities for Americans.”

Immigrant rights groups say the downside to a drop is that businesses will lose part of their workforce.

Indeed, farmers and hospitality groups have been flooding the Trump administration with complaints that they can’t get workers to show up anymore amid the high-profile wave of immigration arrests.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated some form of leniency for illegal immigrants who work in those areas of the economy, though he has yet to deliver any concrete policy change.

Mr. Camarota said there may be good reason to wait.

He said there is no evidence from the numbers that the employment of the U.S.-born has fallen. Indeed, the data suggests it has surged in recent months, which could mean people who have struggled to hold jobs are now gaining them.

“That doesn’t mean bad economic news, necessarily,” he said. “It probably means per capita GDP has gone up.”

The CPS data does come with some caveats.

It’s possible that the foreign-born, illegal immigrants in particular, are now lying and claiming to be U.S.-born legal residents. Mr. Camarota said that’s not likely.

It’s also possible that some households with illegal immigrants have stopped responding to the CPS, which could affect the numbers.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/07/15/Immigration_Courts_Arrests_70071_c0-250-6000-3750_s1200x700.jpg?2cb823f519263a3e55a419724463fd44fb7f7c61,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:54.582866

“Arresting U.S. citizens,” Friedman continued, is “an extremely concerning overreach of civil immigration enforcement authority” and “completely unprecedented as far as I know.” Is it legal for ICE to arrest citizens?
So while ICE officers don’t have the legal power to arrest citizens for immigration violations (which they appear to violate every time they arrest U.S. citizens who they suspect are undocumented), ICE officers are legally allowed to arrest citizens for federal crimes, so long as they have reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed.
Hours after Trebach was detained, ICE made its first arrest of a protester in San Francisco.
In videos obtained by Mission Local, the San Francisco protesters, a short woman in her 50s and a taller middle-aged man, are tackled to the ground by ICE agents.","While Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested at least 38 U.S. citizens protesters in Los Angeles this year, last week’s arrest of two protesters in downtown San Francisco appears to be the first time the agency has detained citizens here, according to immigration lawyers from the Bay Area.

“I haven’t seen ICE arresting [U.S. citizen] protestors in the Bay since entering the legal field nearly 20 years ago,” wrote Aliya Karmali, an Oakland immigration attorney and member of the Demonstrations Legal Support Collaborative.

On Friday, ICE agents tackled and detained two protesters, both U.S. citizens, outside the San Francisco ICE field office at 630 Sansome St.

ICE has “been known to racially profile and detain people who may not have documentation of their citizenship,” wrote Karmali, referring to the detention — and sometimes deportation — of U.S. citizens. But now, she continued, they seem to be expanding their authority over all citizens, to arrest for federal crimes in L.A. and here.

But even if ICE detains someone, that federal crime still must be proven through a trial. According to reporting by the Los Angeles Times, only seven of the 38 people charged by ICE in L.A. have been successfully indicted. The rest signed plea deals, had their charges reduced significantly, or even had their cases dismissed — in a number of instances because Department of Homeland Security officers made false statements about the arrests.

That seven out of 38 success record is dismal. For context, around 90 percent of general federal prosecutions result in the defendant pleading guilty, and most others are convicted during trial.

“Trump’s directive to ICE agents to arrest protesters — just like much of his administration’s immigration agenda — is unlawful,” wrote Jennifer Friedman, interim director of the Immigration Unit at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office. “Arresting U.S. citizens,” Friedman continued, is “an extremely concerning overreach of civil immigration enforcement authority” and “completely unprecedented as far as I know.”

Is it legal for ICE to arrest citizens? The answer is, sometimes, yes. But ICE is held accountable to two seemingly dueling provisions.

One policy defines clearly that “ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen.”

Another authorizes immigration officers to arrest any person, regardless of immigration status, “for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States,” if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed.

So while ICE officers don’t have the legal power to arrest citizens for immigration violations (which they appear to violate every time they arrest U.S. citizens who they suspect are undocumented), ICE officers are legally allowed to arrest citizens for federal crimes, so long as they have reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed.

But an ICE officer can only conduct these arrests if they’ve been certified for “successfully completing a training course encompassing such arrests.” That’s impossible to check as most of the ICE officers seen in public cover their faces and don’t wear identifying information, making it impossible to identify the ICE officer to check his or her training record.

One such arrest happened last Friday, when ICE officers took U.S. citizen Amanda Trebach into federal custody, outside Terminal Island, a military base off the coast of Los Angeles that ICE has been using to prepare for raids. Trebach was released the following day with no charges, after hundreds of protesters expressed support for her freedom.

Hours after Trebach was detained, ICE made its first arrest of a protester in San Francisco.

In videos obtained by Mission Local, the San Francisco protesters, a short woman in her 50s and a taller middle-aged man, are tackled to the ground by ICE agents. One of the people detained, who asked for anonymity given their ongoing case, reported bruises on their ribs and wrists.

Other video footage shows that San Francisco police officers, who previously arrested over 200 anti-ICE protesters in June, and the Federal Protective Services (“Homeland Security’s Domestic Police Force”) were also at 630 Sansome St. earlier in the day. But agents wearing ICE uniforms were the ones to make the detentions.

The protesters were held for approximately two and half hours in separate holding cells inside the federal building, after being stripped of their personal belongings. When released, they were served a number of citations that the protesters deny — including interference with public duties, which ICE has leveraged against many of the people that agents detained in L.A.

It’s unclear whether the protesters in San Francisco were simply detained, or formally arrested and booked. They won’t know for sure until the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney decides whether to press charges, which could take weeks or not happen at all.

The story was updated the afternoon of Aug. 12.

The corrected story is below.

A 4-year-old boy’s ongoing care for stage 4 kidney cancer was interrupted when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers illegally deported him, his sister and mother “without even a semblance of due process,” attorneys for the family say.

Though they are U.S. citizens and were born in Louisiana, the boy and his 7-year-old sister were deported to Honduras along with their 25-year-old mother, who is a Honduran citizen, on April 25, according to a federal lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The filing uses pseudonyms for the family, referring to the brother and sister as Romeo and Ruby and their mother as Rosario.

Before their deportations, Romeo, now 5, was receiving “life-saving” treatment at a New Orleans children’s hospital for his “rare and aggressive form” of cancer, following his diagnosis at age 2, a complaint says.

“As a direct consequence of ICE’s unlawful conduct, Romeo was deprived of much-needed continuity in his treatment, and he has faced substantial health risks due to his inability to access emergency specialized care and the routine critical oncological care that was available to him in the United States,” his family’s attorneys wrote in the complaint.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Romeo and his family, as well as a second family also wrongly deported by ICE under similar circumstances on April 25, according to the National Immigration Project, Gibson Dunn, Most & Associates, and Ware Immigration, groups representing the case.

The second family includes Julia, 30, a mother from Honduras. She has two daughters, Jade, 2, a U.S. citizen born in Baton Rouge, and Janelle, 11, also a Honduran citizen. Those names are also pseudonyms.

The same week of both families’ deportations, Rosario and Julia separately went to what they thought were supposed to be “regularly scheduled check-ins” with an ICE contractor.

However, officers with ICE apprehended both women and their children “in hotel rooms” in secret, the National Immigration Project said in a July 31 news release.

ICE “denied them the opportunity to speak to family and make decisions about or arrangements for their minor children, denied them access to counsel, and deported them within less than a day in one case and just over 2 days in the other,” the advocacy organization said.

According to the lawsuit, ICE did not let Rosario or Julia decide whether they wanted their children to come with them to Honduras or to make arrangements for them to stay in the U.S. with other loved ones.

“Given Romeo’s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States,” the complaint says.

DHS, however, maintains both women wanted their children with them.

In response to McClatchy News’ request for comment for DHS and ICE on Aug. 11, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “the media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported. This is false and irresponsible.”

“Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” McLaughlin added. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.”

The lawsuit has been brought against Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE and ICE Director Todd Lyons, as well as New Orleans ICE Field Office Director Brian Acuna, the office’s Assistant Field Office Director Scott Ladwig and the office’s former director, Mellissa Harper.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre declined to comment.

‘Detained and deported U.S. citizens’

After being deported in April, Rosario said in a statement shared in National Immigration Project’s news release that life in Hondorus has been “incredibly hard.”

“I don’t have the resources to care for my children the way they need,” Rosario said.

The morning of April 25, ICE officers are accused of waking Rosario, Romeo and Ruby and forcing them into a van.

They drove them to an airport in the Alexandria area and had them flown to Honduras, the lawsuit says.

With her son still in need of specialized treatment for his cancer, which had spread to his lungs, she has to send Romeo “back and forth” from Honduras to the U.S. for care, without her, according to the complaint.

“Even though she has very limited financial resources, Rosario has already had to pay for flights and travel companions to enable her children to return to the United States for Romeo’s necessary medical appointments,” the complaint says.

Romeo, whose health has worsened, has been temporarily staying in the U.S. for cancer treatment, according to the filing.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare that ICE wrongly arrested, detained and deported Rosario, Romeo and Ruby, as well as Julia, Jade and Janelle, in violation of their constitutional rights.

“This whole situation has been incredibly stressful,” Julia said in a statement shared by the National Immigration Project.

“Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard,” she added.

In a statement to McClatchy News, National Immigration Project attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones said “ICE put these families through a series of incredibly traumatizing experiences, taking actions that are completely shocking from a human perspective and illegal even by ICE’s own standards.”

“ICE denied these families the fundamental opportunity to make meaningful choices about the care and custody of their children, and detained and deported U.S. citizens in flagrant violation of its own policy and the law,” Alvarez-Jones added.

The families are seeking an unspecified amount in damages and demand a jury trial.

Days later, his mother and sister made a decision that likely pleased the Trump administration: They followed Colindres out of the United States.

Colindres’ mother, Ada Bell Baquedano Amador, told Spectrum News 1 that she and her two kids had left Honduras to escape rampant violence in the country. In 2023, an immigration judge denied their asylum application and issued a final order of removal. Now, Baquedano Amador was wearing an ankle monitor, and the Trump administration had given her 30 days to leave the United States. With her son gone, she decided to return with her daughter to the country they’d once fled.

“Thank God, this is all going to be over,” Baquedano Amador said.

That sentiment, variations of which have reverberated across the country, is exactly what President Donald Trump wants. There are millions of undocumented people in the United States ― far more than Trump will likely be able to deport on his own. So the administration is working overtime to create a pervasive atmosphere of punishment, uncertainty and fear that it hopes will convince people in the immigration legal system to leave the United States on their own.

The Trump administration has claimed that those who “self-deport” now will get the chance to reenter the U.S. later. (“Self-deport” is not a legal term; two Mexican American satirists invented it over 30 years ago.)

But leaving the country without following specific legal procedures could make it far more difficult to return ― and the administration has consistently failed to inform people in immigration proceedings of crucial details that could affect their future cases.

Meanwhile, the administration has filled airwaves with advertisements urging people to leave the country, plastered jails and courtrooms with misleading information, cut funding for legal aid programs, announced steep penalties for not leaving the country after receiving a removal order, revived a World War II-era law threatening criminal prosecution unless people who aren’t citizens register with the government, and massively ramped up efforts to arrest and jail people during the course of their proceedings. Officials have also used the brutal conditions in immigration detention as self-deportation propaganda.

“DHS has made it abundantly clear that those who are in our country illegally have a choice — they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported,” a department spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement.

Some of the intimidation and pressure tactics are obvious, like painting immigrants as “foreign invaders,” or having masked agents jumping out of rental trucks and making arrests in immigration court. Others are just coming into view. The New York Times reported last week on a pattern in which immigration officials have arrested and detained parents, separating them from their children and threatening to send the children to shelters unless the parents agree to be deported as a family ― an echo of Trump’s first-term “family separation” policy. And a DHS spokesperson recently pressured DACA recipients to “self-deport,” even though the program offers a temporary protection from deportation.

Voluntary departures from the U.S. have spiked in recent weeks.

The fear tactics and hyperaggressive enforcement, critics say, have also turned the immigration system on its head.

Where the government was once at least marginally concerned with protecting the legal rights of migrants and asylum seekers, it is now actively seeking to subvert those protections, all with the goal of purging the United States of millions of unwanted neighbors as quickly as possible.

“I really feel like the whole purpose behind this is to overwhelm the system at every single point possible,” said Imelda Maynard, director of legal services at Estrella del Paso, which provides free immigration legal services to migrants and refugees in West Texas and New Mexico.

“I really feel like the whole purpose behind this is to overwhelm the system at every single point possible.”

“It’s all working hand-in-hand to try and get people to have no hope, and to just say, ‘This is too hard, I give up.’”

‘And Then Chaos’

The pressure campaign has included a sustained effort to limit legal resources available to people in immigration detention.

Unlike in criminal court, people in immigration proceedings are not guaranteed a lawyer if they can’t afford one, even though legal representation is a key factor in the success of immigration cases.

To help address this gap, the federal government has historically provided funding for efforts like the Legal Orientation Program, in which legal service providers give people in immigration detention information about the immigration system and their legal rights.

Not anymore. The Trump administration terminated these programs in April. Legal aid groups have sued in response, and while some terminations have been halted by judges, children and adults alike are being left without key legal information as their cases proceed.

For Estrella del Paso ― which is among those fighting in court to restore the legal aid programs ― the terminations have ended access to lists of who is being held in local immigration detention centers, as well as eliminated the free, private phone lines detainees once used to consult with the group’s staff in confidence.

With the legal aid programs gone, the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive, often misleading campaign to convince people to simply leave the country, even though this could end up negatively impacting future efforts to reenter the United States.

“You have a cutting off of information first, so that people don’t have access to correct information, followed by disinformation ― and then chaos,” Maynard said.

Case in point: The Trump administration has blanketed detention centers and immigration courtrooms around the country with posters pressuring people to abandon their legal cases and leave the country. Attorneys and other observers say the information on the posters is misleading or downright false.

Advertisement

One version of the poster, a red-and-blue “Warning To Self-Deport,” has been spotted across the country in hallways, detention center libraries, and attached to case files ― “even orders granting relief, like asylum,” according to Amelia Dagen, a staff attorney for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which provides free legal representation to people in the immigration system and participates in impact litigation.

“Individuals who have just won asylum are eventually going to be eligible to apply for green cards, and then for citizenship, and so this messaging about self-deportation doesn’t even apply to them, because they are no longer deportable,” Dagen added. (Like Estrella del Paso, the Amica Center has sued the administration over terminations of legal aid programs in which it participates.)

But the issues with these posters go far beyond who’s receiving them.

Among them: The posters make no mention of the expansive legal rights of undocumented people to remain in the United States. People who fear persecution in their home country are allowed to remain in the United States while they make an asylum case to an immigration judge, for example, or to pursue protections under the international Convention Against Torture.

Advertisement

But the poster doesn’t say any of this. Instead it uses charged language that has no legal significance ― “illegal alien,” “self-deport” ― and absolutist phrases that don’t represent how immigration law actually works. For example, it threatens “immediate deportation” for people who don’t immediately leave on their own, though so-called “expedited removal” only applies in specific circumstances. Similarly, it warns of being “barred from returning,” even though bars to reentering the United States are based on individual circumstances and are often temporary.

What’s more, the poster ignores the fact that simply leaving the United States could have catastrophic legal consequences. If someone leaves the country without resolving their immigration case ― and if they miss a scheduled immigration hearing as a result ― they could receive a deportation order in absentia, which in turn could make them ineligible for certain forms of legal relief in the future, or possibly lead to a bar on reentry. For those who have lived out-of-status in the United States and accrued “unlawful presence,” leaving the country this way could lead to a multiyear bar on coming back to the United States.

One U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “Self-Deportation” webpage does acknowledge this issue, but makes no firm commitment to addressing it.

“If you’re already in proceedings before a Department of Justice immigration judge, leaving may result in a bar to reentry, which means you may not be able to return to the U.S. for a specific period of time,” the page says. “ICE may agree to seek dismissal of removal proceedings if you prove you left the U.S. on your own — and that way, you may be able to avoid getting a final order of removal (and the negative consequences that come with it).”

There are specific ways people can leave the country while protecting their legal rights, including requesting voluntary departure from an immigration judge. But every immigration case is unique, and respondents should ideally work with an attorney to chart their path forward ― something else the poster doesn’t mention.

Instead, it vaguely promotes “future opportunity for legal immigration” if people heed its warning.

Trump’s attacks on legal aid programs, combined with his administration’s aggressive focus on pressuring people to surrender their rights, is a noxious mix, especially for the most vulnerable populations in detention.

When Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) visited Florida’s infamous Krome detention center in June, his staff observed that the center’s Behavioral Health Unit ― “a unit dedicated to assisting individuals with mental health needs” ― had “a flyer in a common room in the unit that asked, ‘Do you want to go home?’ and provided information about how to self-deport.”

Two months prior, the administration had ordered legal service providers to discontinue the National Qualified Representative Program, which for over a decade provided government-funded attorneys for people in immigration proceedings who’ve been found mentally incompetent to represent themselves.

Three weeks ago, a federal district judge ordered the administration to reinstate the policy, writing in a motion granting plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction that without the program, “People who have been adjudicated by immigration courts to be mentally incompetent under existing procedures will be left to do precisely what a court has just found they are not capable of doing—represent themselves in legal proceedings.”

Advertisement

“Although Defendants insist that there are sufficient safeguards in place without the NQRP to mitigate the harm to individuals deemed mentally incompetent, the record provides substantial reason to conclude otherwise,” Judge Amir Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote.

It’s not clear how many people who qualified for that program gave up their legal rights in the intervening months.

‘You May End Up Here’

The Trump administration, particularly Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has been explicit that it is leveraging the terror of languishing behind bars, for months or even years, in order to coerce people into leaving the country.

Advertisement

In March, after the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men, without charge, to El Salvador’s most infamous prison for indefinite detention where they faced brutal beatings and alleged sexual assault, Noem shot a video from inside the prison.

“I also want everybody to know: If you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face,” she said. She called the prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, “one of the tools in our toolkit.”

Then, in May, Noem said, “If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest.”

And during a July press conference marking the opening of the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center ― the tent city was erected on a Florida Everglades airfield in a matter of days, and is already renowned for its terrible conditions and ostentatious cruelty ― Noem, sitting next to Trump, held up a flier urging undocumented people to leave the country.

“If you don’t,” she warned, “you may end up here.”

Noem and others in the administration have worked hard to make that threat a reality.

The administration has abandoned the Biden-era policy of prioritizing the arrest of serious criminals and recent arrivals, and is instead detaining whoever it can get its hands on, including by arresting people at immigration court, carrying out large-scale raids and pressing people on the street to share information about their immigration status. The number of people in immigration detention hit a record high in June, and the share of those arrested by immigration agents who don’t have any criminal record at all has continued to increase, according to the government’s own data.

“On the ground, people are very concerned and fearful, because even people who know their rights are seeing that ICE is not abiding by the law,” said Jessie Hahn, a senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on low-income immigrants. Hahn recounted a know-your-rights training for farmworker advocates and attorneys in California, where federal law enforcement has carried out raids targeting agricultural workers.

“I was getting all these questions in the chat, like, ‘What about when they break the car windows?’ And it gets to a point where I’m not sure what to say to people, other than ‘call the television station,’ because that’s a violation,” Hahn said. “And our ability to hold them accountable for that violation is really important, and yet there are widespread violations happening on the part of ICE right now, in the way that arrests are being conducted.”

At the same time, conditions in detention centers have grown dire, veteran legal observers say.

“The conditions are the worst that we’ve ever seen,” said Denise Noonan Slavin, who spent decades as an immigration judge, including 15 years at the Krome detention center in Miami.

“People are basically being treated like animals, in unsanitary conditions, with no access to medical care, legal counsel or family,” said Slavin, who is now a senior adviser at Americans for Immigrant Justice, a nonprofit law firm involved in several lawsuits against the administration. (The DHS spokesperson told HuffPost the same thing it has told dozens of other outlets since July: “Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.”)

Slavin said people seem to be “disappearing” for days at a time in ICE’s network of detention centers, and noted that 2025 has been a particularly deadly year for immigration detention, in part because immigration agents are arresting people who in the past likely would have been allowed to live freely.

Isidro Perez, a 75-year-old man who arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1966, was one of those who recently died in ICE custody. Perez served an 18-month prison sentence in 1984 ― 40 years ago ― on cannabis charges, but had lived the intervening decades without incident, The Miami Herald reported, working as a mechanic, and rescuing cats and dogs.

He was arrested by immigration agents at a Key Largo community center in June, and died three weeks later. Perez’s friend and former partner told the Herald he’d called her from detention, describing sleeping on the floor in an overcrowded facility. Yet another man died in ICE custody last week.

In the past, immigration detention was reserved for the tiny fraction of undocumented people seen as a danger to the community, or as flight risks. But over time, through Democratic and Republican presidents, the number of people in detention has grown dramatically. Now, the Trump administration has moved to prohibit bond hearings for people who crossed the border without authorization, a description that applies to millions of people, and one that means people arrested could remain behind bars for months or years as their cases proceed. And billions of dollars in new funding from Congress could explode the number of available detention beds.

Immigration detention is not like federal or state prison; people aren’t sent there after receiving a conviction and a sentence, and it’s not supposed to be a punishment.

Advertisement

But that’s how the administration is treating it. A “Self-Deportation Fact Sheet” warns that if undocumented people don’t leave the country, “ICE will put you in a detention facility. Some people remain in detention for months.”

“People in detention are there indefinitely,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network. “They don’t have a sentence, they don’t actually know when or if they’ll be released, whether they’ll be released back into the United States, or if they’ll be deported. So there’s just so much deep uncertainty.”

That uncertainty “does a lot to psychologically compel somebody, and they might be like, ‘These conditions are terrible, this is awful, maybe deportation is an answer,’” Shah said.

CBP Home

Because “self-deported” isn’t a legal category, we don’t have precise numbers regarding how many people have voluntarily left the United States. We also don’t know what the Trump administration considers a “self-deportation,” or if they are counting these figures in their overall deportation numbers.

More immigration cases concluded with voluntary departures in June than in any other month for at least 27 years, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, an independent organization that collects and analyzes federal records. Still, this is partially a result of the Trump administration’s fixation on immigration enforcement. Recent months have seen highs for immigration court outcomes overall, and voluntary departures made up a very small portion of the sum of people leaving the country as a result of immigration proceedings.

“Case records from [the Executive Office for Immigration Review] confirm what many have witnessed in courtrooms across the country,” said Adam Sawyer, a data analyst at Relevant Research. “About 3,700 people chose to voluntarily depart in June 2025. That’s more voluntary departures than we have seen in any single month since at least 1998.”

CBP Home, the Trump administration’s app for immigrants to “report their intent to depart,” provides some more insight. The app is a mutation of the Biden-era “CBP One” app, which allowed people to schedule asylum appointments with immigration officials. Now, on the contrary, the “self-deport” posters decorating detention centers and courthouses ― as well as Noem’s television advertisements ― direct people to the app as a first step toward exiting the United States. In exchange, the administration has promised to cover travel costs, waive fines related to immigration offenses, and even give out $1,000 “exit bonuses.”

DHS did not answer questions about how much money has actually been distributed, but a spokesperson pointed to a press conference Noem held Friday, in which she said that “thousands and thousands” of people had used CBP Home. Noem also said “hundreds of thousands of people” ― and later, “over a million people” ― had left the United States on their own accord without necessarily using the CBP Home app. She did not cite any evidence for the claim, other than what she said she’d heard from foreign officials.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in April that “5,000 people have used the app to self-deport as of the start of April,” in the outlet’s words. On June 25, The Atlantic cited an unnamed senior administration official who said “that more than 7,000 people have signed up so far, and of those, more than 3,000 have confirmed departures using the app.” On July 23, CBS News referred to internal government data to report “the Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term.”

“If you go on the CBP Home app and go home now, you will get the chance to come back to the United States legally,” Noem claimed during the “Alligator Alcatraz” press conference. Otherwise, you may end up deported “and never get the chance to come back,” she said. But being deported doesn’t necessarily equate to a lifelong ban on reentry, and there’s nothing to indicate using CBP Home has any affect on someone’s ability to come back to the United States at a later date.

The CBP Home app seemingly does not include any acknowledgement of the rights immigrants could be abandoning if they leave the country the wrong way. A DHS privacy impact assessment makes no mention of sharing any data on voluntary departures with the immigration court system.

And despite Noem’s statement about “the chance to come back” to the U.S. ― and similar, even-less-legible noise from Trump ― the administration has not gone to Congress with any proposal for making legal reentry easier for people who voluntarily leave the country.

The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies immigration, summarized the issue in June: “Noem and other administration officials have also said that self-deportees ‘may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,’ which may seem to offer a new immigration pathway or access to a visa. How the administration could accomplish this is unclear, given most unauthorized immigrants are barred from re-entry for multiple years and it is the absence of sufficient legal pathways in the first place that has prompted many to enter illegally or overstay a visa.”

“The CBP Home self-deportation thing is a joke, from a legal perspective,” said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies trends in immigration enforcement.

“The CBP Home self-deportation thing is a joke, from a legal perspective.”

“Your ability to either come back or not come back has nothing to do with CBP Home,” he added. “There are people who are leaving, and they’re going to have a bar [to reentry] and they’re going to technically, legally, ‘abandon’ their applications for relief and get an in-absentia removal order... At the same time, [the administration has] said, ‘Use this app or we’re going to find you and deport you. And you’re never going to be allowed to come back.’ Well, that’s not true, either. That is not an honest, factual statement. Deportation does not automatically result in a permanent bar.”

Several people have also run into trouble after attempting to leave the country without identification documents ― which they either didn’t have to begin with, or were taken by immigration agents in the United States, Noticias Telemundo reported last month.

And though the administration promised to “deprioritize” the detention of people who sign up to leave the country through CBP Home, that’s not guaranteed. Last month, a man who pursued voluntary departure through CBP Home was arrested by immigration agents who falsely accused him of skipping appointments, 285 South, a metro Atlanta immigration-focused publication, reported.

The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration.
The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.” Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.
“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump's immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration's changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

The new reports “reveal a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro's speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”",https://7b1de02a7bcf9c1df487-6849f9022b05f72b83236695aa4e9a0a.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploads/ap/2025/1297380/image-0.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:57:02.031669

Several sources involved in the consultation process, some of whom have requested anonymity as the bill’s wording is not finalised, have said that roundtable discussions in April prompted concessions from the Allan government.

This included dropping plans for a full ban on “face coverings” at protests, which was planned to carry a fine of up to $2,000. Instead, it is understood the government will propose penalties only when a person wearing a face covering is refusing to cooperate with police or believed to be committing a criminal act.

A senior Victorian government source said such a measure, combined with anti-vilification laws set to take effect in September, would allow authorities to “unmask” neo-Nazis, who marched through Melbourne’s CBD in face coverings at the weekend.

Anastasia Radievska, protest rights campaigner at the Australian Democracy Network said the shift was the result of “broad opposition” to the plan, including by human rights, legal, faith, First Nations and disability rights groups.

“The prohibition on masks has serious impacts on community health, the participation of people with disabilities, the participation of victim-survivors of domestic and sexual violence in protest. It’s not an appropriate way to address the problems of racist violence, which is what the laws were advertised as tackling,” Radievska said.

“These groups have worked to ensure that any restrictions that are introduced – although we’ve argued that Victoria doesn’t need new protest restrictions – are appropriately targeted and don’t impact on the participation of these vulnerable groups in protests – and actually target radicalised violence and hate.”

An outright ban on attachment devices such as chains, glue or locks, which are commonly used in climate protests, is also expected to be narrowed and will apply only when there is a community safety risk.

This would mean non-violent acts such as those committed by Zelda D’Aprano – who is immortalised in bronze outside Trades Hall after she chained herself to a government building to protest against the lack of equal pay for women – would not be affected.

The proposal for “safe access” areas around places of worship, which was also floated by the government in December, has been described by several stakeholders as “dead in the water”. But this was disputed by the government source who said it was still being considered, though was proving “incredibly complex”.

However, a ban on the display of terrorist symbols at protests is likely to proceed, despite reservations about how “terrorist organisation” could be defined.

Stakeholders were initially told the changes would be introduced when parliament resumed after the midwinter break but the timeline has now shifted to the end of the year.

The premier, Jacinta Allan, told reporters on Tuesday the laws would not be aimed at protests but at extremist behaviour.

“People who are taking the opportunity to engage in extreme and dangerous behaviour under the guise of participating in a protest – that’s what the new laws will be cracking down on., she said.

It comes after Victoria’s new police chief, Mike Bush, ruled out a permit system for protests in a series of interviews last month, noting they had not been effective in other states.

Labor’s rank-and-file has also pushed back, with state conference carrying a motion earlier this month calling on the government to abandon its proposed changes.

“Inconvenience is not a form of violence,” it said, noting several wins of the labour movement were only possible as a result.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d372fec67c9d687ef6a2f72683295cd62599723c/337_685_3121_2498/master/3121.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb053f1738b22f05d3867b20f3e5e693",N,,2025-08-12 16:56:42.430204

Cotrin said “there’s no way” Epstein would have killed himself, which is what prison officials say happened in his jail cell at a Manhattan prison in 2019. Cotrin worked for Epstein for 18 years, and said in all that time he never witnessed any abuse.

Cotrin, along with Epstein’s brother, also said there are forensic inconsistencies in the report claiming Epstein took his own life. A review by the FBI and the Department of Justice ruled out murder.

Media Miss by the right: Investigation reveals hundreds of human rights abuses in US immigrant detention centers

An investigation out of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office uncovered more than 500 credible reports of human rights abuses at immigrant detention centers across the U.S.

Investigators reportedly found evidence of both physical and sexual abuse, and that children and pregnant women were among the victims.

Reports show some detainees claimed they were denied medical care and that they were held in overcrowded rooms with only one bathroom. Detention officials also reportedly used flash-bang grenades when a toilet was flooded in protest.

The investigation also found some children, who were U.S. citizens and had serious medical conditions like cancer, were held in these detention centers alongside their parents.

The October session will feature 10 arguments over five days, while the November session will feature nine over five days.

Both sessions include important cases. On Oct. 15, the court will hear oral arguments in a Louisiana case that could limit the federal Voting Rights Act, and on Oct. 7 it will hear a challenge to Colorado’s ban on “conversion therapy.” In November, there will be oral argument in a case involving the methods used to assess a defendant’s claim that he is intellectually disabled and therefore cannot be executed.

When the court hears argument in Louisiana v. Callais, it will be the second round of arguments in the case, which comes to the court as a challenge to the congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature adopted in 2024. That map, which contained a second majority-Black district, followed a federal court’s ruling that a 2022 map, which contained only one majority-Black district, violated Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result “in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.” A group of voters describing themselves as “non-African American” went to federal court, where they argued that the 2024 map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander – that is, it relied too heavily on race.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case in March, but it did not issue an opinion in the case. Instead, on the last day before the court’s summer recess began, it announced that the case would be reargued in the fall. On Aug. 1, the justices instructed the litigants in the case to file briefs discussing whether the creation of a second majority-Black district in the 2024 map violates the Constitution – a question that at least one voting-rights expert suggested could call into question the constitutionality of Section 2 of the VRA.

On Oct. 7, the justices will hear argument in Chiles v. Salazar, a challenge to Colorado’s ban on “conversion therapy” – therapy to “convert” an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity. A federal appeals court in Denver upheld the law, reasoning that it regulated the health-care profession rather than therapists’ speech.

And in Hamm v. Smith, on Nov. 4, the justices will consider how and whether courts should assess a defendant’s claim that he cannot be executed because he is intellectually disabled when he has taken multiple IQ tests.

Both the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday told federal union representatives that the agencies would be canceling all collective bargaining agreements, effective immediately.

USCIS and FEMA are ending the use of office space and resources for union activities, revoking official time, and halting grievance and arbitration processes, according to emails viewed by Federal News Network. The two agencies said federal union representatives are expected to return to other work duties full-time.

Neither USCIS nor FEMA responded to Federal News Network’s requests for comment on their decisions to terminate the union contracts.

The cancellations at USCIS impact union contracts with both the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council.

AFGE Local 4060, which represents FEMA employees, said it would continue to fight the Trump administration in court.

“This is an unprecedented attack on the rights of federal workers,” AFGE Local 4060 officials wrote in an email to bargaining unit members, obtained by Federal News Network. “AFGE will continue to litigate the case in district court, confident in our legal position. We remain committed to opposing the government’s appeal and will fight for both preliminary and permanent relief for all AFGE members.”

A few other agencies have also moved forward with ending their collective bargaining agreements. USCIS and FEMA’s announcements come after the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency similarly terminated their union contracts and canceled all use of official time for union representatives.

The agencies’ actions follow an appeals court decision that allowed the Trump administration to move forward with implementing President Donald Trump’s March 27 executive order to terminate union activities at most agencies, while the litigation remains ongoing.

Trump’s order cited a narrow legal provision that allows the president to suspend collective bargaining for national security reasons. Following the order, multiple federal unions sued the administration, arguing that it targeted federal unions that had spoken up against the administration, using speech that is protected under the First Amendment.

But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that based on the language of the executive order and a White House fact sheet, Trump would have taken the action to cancel union activities anyway — regardless of what the federal unions had said.

AFGE National President Everett Kelley has vowed to continue to fight in court over Trump’s anti-union actions, and believes AFGE “will ultimately prevail.” The Washington Post first reported the news of USCIS and FEMA ending their collective bargaining agreements.

Inside Higher Ed analyzed more than 40 lawsuits related to higher education that were filed against the Trump administration. More than a dozen cases contested grant cuts, making that the most-litigated issue before the courts. The second-most frequent theme of litigation was the reduction in force at the U.S. Department of Education. Lawsuits have also challenged federal crackdowns on international students and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.

District courts have ruled against the Trump administration in nearly two-thirds of the lawsuits, Inside Higher Ed found. And at the appellate level, seven rulings went against the Trump administration, while only two reversed lower court injunctions blocking grant terminations related to anti-DEI executive action. White House officials have accused judges who block administration policy of overstepping their authority.

The Trump administration nonetheless has notched wins in a smaller number of cases to reach the Supreme Court to date. Justices have overturned three lower court rulings that cleared the way for mass layoffs at the Department of Education and cuts to teacher training grants, Inside Higher Ed reported.

Still, the publication’s analysis shows that much of the litigation is yet to be resolved. Almost a quarter of the 40 cases remain undecided, and where a district judge has issued a ruling, 18 cases have been appealed. Of those, nine cases await an appeals court decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has only ruled in three of the five higher education-related cases that have reached the court.

Litigation has become a major strategy of groups opposing the administration’s efforts to overhaul colleges and universities since President Donald Trump’s return to office. Professional associations, including the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, as well as Democratic state attorneys general, including those in California, have led many of the lawsuits opposing the Trump administration’s policy.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell wrote in an email to Inside Higher Ed that state attorneys general will “continue to hold the line because our children and the future of our democracy depend on it.”

“Any deal that lets Russia off the hook for war crimes is not peace—it’s a green light for the next massacre,” said Brian Dooley, Senior Advisor at Human Rights First. “This meeting looks less like a serious attempt at reaching a just settlement and more like two Nineteenth Century European monarchs carving up foreign land and resources.”

Putin has been subject to an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court since March 2023 for alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine.

There are obviously a variety of reasons why the right wing press’ targeting of judges and putting them in danger of violence is problematic. One of those issues is how poor the journalists’ understanding is of their subject matter. I have written a couple of times now about the Palestinian family who have been turned into a political football.

I have explained that the process they used to make their application was the one required by the Home Office. Yet why let the facts get in the way of a piece attacking an Upper Tribunal judge who made one of the decisions in that case, as the Mail on Sunday did yesterday (do not go find this and give them any clicks unless you are going to submit a complaint!).

The piece again focussed on the fact that the family had applied under the Ukrainian scheme, before then also wrongly attributing the recent High Court decision in the family’s case against the Foreign Office to the same Upper Tribunal judge (the judgment was bizarrely referred to in the paper as the judge having a “public spat” with the Foreign Secretary). I would be embarrassed to publish an article that rife with errors, but perhaps I am being generous by assuming that inaccurate coverage of migration issues is based on a misunderstanding rather than deliberate misinformation.

There are plenty of Upper Tribunal judges out there making decisions that would delight the right. I have seen cases where evidence has been ignored and people returned to danger, yet balance is clearly not what they are after here.

On Free Movement, we covered the new UK/France returns agreement with an explainer on the treaty, new appendix to the immigration rules and caseworker guidance. We have a lot more information about the part of the scheme that will bring people to the UK, including the expression of interest application form. The team at Refugee Legal Support also gave their perspective as an organisation working with people in northern France.

Also last week, the July roundup podcast is out and there were a couple of appeals against SIAC decisions, one on deprivation and one on costs. Today we published a really useful explainer on how to change employer if someone is on a skilled worker visa.

Last week Dallas residents asked the city council whether the city would opt into ICE's 287(g) Program, which allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Johnson — a Democrat whose district includes Dallas, Collin and Denton counties — sent a letter to Chief of Police Daniel Comeaux Friday asking for a detailed explanation of the Dallas Police Department's current policy regarding the program.

In the letter, Johnson said the program has resulted in the detention and deportation of individuals without criminal records.

""These instances raise critical civil rights concerns and can damage trust between immigrant communities and local police, particularly when reports surface of individuals being detained without clear identification or justification,"" she said.

KERA reached out to the Dallas Police Department for comment and will update this story with a response.

Johnson set a deadline of Aug. 21 to receive a written response from Comeaux answering six questions related to the police department's immigration policy.

The questions are:

Has your department entered into any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or informal agreements with ICE or other DHS agencies?

What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?

Does your department collect or share immigration status information during routine policing?

What is the department’s process for ensuring transparency and accountability in federal partnerships?

Are DPD officers ever stationed or detailed to work alongside ICE officers, and if so, in what capacity?

Has your department received funding, equipment, or other resources from ICE or DHS this year? If so, for what purposes?

Comeaux has faced criticism after saying his department would fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in a Fox News interview earlier this year.

""If there's a federal agency that's doing an operation and they need our assistance, we'll be there to help them,"" he said, ""as long as they're doing it by the law and doing it with respect.""

He later clarified the department's policy, saying his comments were specifically about those with felony warrants, but reiterated the department would continue to assist ""federal partners.""

A police spokesperson told KERA News last week the commissioner's position and the department's approach to immigration issues had not changed.

So, while it doesn’t look like the political theater behind Trump Burger is going to work in Beainy’s favor, nothing is a guarantee.
Beainy claims he purchased Hawa’s 50 percent stake for $65,000, and Hawa, who started the original Trump Burger in Bellville, says this is untrue and has filed a countersuit seeking $1 million in damages.
Earlier this year, Eater visited the Houston restaurant and walked away quite unimpressed.

Roland Mehrez Beainy, a Lebanese immigrant who began operating the Trump Burgers mini-chain in 2020, has been accused of overstaying his visitor’s visa, which expired in February 2024, according to the Guardian. As a result, the 28-year-old was arrested by immigration officials in May.

Beainy has also been accused of having an assault charge on his record and orchestrating a fake marriage in order to gain permanent residency — members of his own family called it a “sham designed to game the system,” according to the New Republic. The Department of Homeland Security says there’s no proof that Beainy and the woman he allegedly tried to secure legal status through ever lived under the same roof.

In a statement provided to Fox, ICE said that, under the Trump administration, it’s “committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.”

Beainy is calling the allegations against him “90 percent untrue” and has his immigration hearing scheduled for November 18, 2025.

So, while it doesn’t look like the political theater behind Trump Burger is going to work in Beainy’s favor, nothing is a guarantee. Trump is known to help friends and supporters, even going as far as pardoning the rapper Kodak Black, who was granted release when he was serving time for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

Ever the busy man, Beainy is fighting immigration proceedings while still owning Trump Burgers in Flatonia, Kemah, and Houston, and is also embroiled in legal battles over the chainlet. There’s one involving the landlord at the Kemah location, where there’s an accusation of an unlawful takeover. Beainy is also battling with Iyad Abuelhawa (also known as Eddie Hawa) over who actually owns what stake in the restaurant. Beainy claims he purchased Hawa’s 50 percent stake for $65,000, and Hawa, who started the original Trump Burger in Bellville, says this is untrue and has filed a countersuit seeking $1 million in damages.

Earlier this year, Eater visited the Houston restaurant and walked away quite unimpressed. “The chargrilled burger patties are thick but bland, topped with a waxy cheese that lacks any memorable flavor,” says former regional editor Brittany Britto Garley. The atmosphere is painted as gauche and kind of creepy. Britto Garley spotted a little boy wearing a shirt that read “Daddy’s Home,” in reference to Trump’s re-election. The final verdict came down to Trump Burger serving as a refuge for someone who “supports [the Trump] administration’s many compromising decisions.” Apparently, the restaurant can serve as a refuge for those people — just not the country.

The Hudson Correctional Facility, which has been closed since at least 2014, was previously operated by the GEO Group, which runs the Aurora detention facility.
If it serves as an ICE processing facility with that bed count, ICE will have nearly doubled its detention capacity in the state.
The agency was seeking to add roughly 1,000 new detention beds in the Denver operational area, which includes both Colorado and Wyoming.
According to state records, the Hudson facility was built in 2009 on 50 acres and has just over 300,000 square feet inside its buildings.","Federal immigration authorities intend to open a second Colorado detention center in Hudson — about 30 miles northeast of Denver — members of the state’s congressional delegation were told this week.

Through a spokeswoman, U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen confirmed to The Denver Post that she and other lawmakers were told of the plans for Hudson during a visit to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora on Monday morning.

In a proposal sent to ICE earlier this year, Highlands REIT, a Chicago-based real estate investment trust, offered the shuttered private prison it owns in Hudson as a potential new detention center, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union. The Hudson Correctional Facility, which has been closed since at least 2014, was previously operated by the GEO Group, which runs the Aurora detention facility.

When it was open, the prison had a capacity of 1,250 beds. If it serves as an ICE processing facility with that bed count, ICE will have nearly doubled its detention capacity in the state. The Aurora facility is contracted to hold up to 1,360 people.

Neither GEO nor Highlands REIT responded to messages seeking comment Monday. Spokespeople for ICE also did not return emails seeking more information.

But agency officials had previously signaled that Hudson was a likely option. Robert Guadian, the head of ICE’s Denver field office, told Fox31 in April that the agency was in talks with GEO to open a facility in the town of roughly 1,600 people.

That was before the competing submittals were made public in July by the ACLU. The former Hudson Correctional Facility was one of six potential sites offered to ICE earlier this year, according to records the ACLU obtained through a records request.

The agency was seeking to add roughly 1,000 new detention beds in the Denver operational area, which includes both Colorado and Wyoming.

Immigration arrests have surged in Colorado so far this year, and congressional Republicans steered $45 billion to ICE last month to build new detention centers as part of President Donald Trump’s tax bill.

Bryce Lange, Hudson’s town manager, told The Post that he wasn’t aware of any confirmed plans as of late Monday afternoon. He said government officials had not provided any information to him or officials in other towns and counties that were home to potential detention centers.

A spokeswoman for Weld County said county leaders were also not aware if the site had been chosen. In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis spokesman Eric Maruyama said that ICE has “not shared any details of plans to expand with the governor’s office.” Maruyama said Polis called on ICE to be more transparent with its operations in the state.

According to state records, the Hudson facility was built in 2009 on 50 acres and has just over 300,000 square feet inside its buildings. As of 2012, it had at least four housing units, plus medical and administrative buildings.

His powerful “call to conscience” underscored the moral and religious limits for police agents of the state, and that one’s conscience requires acting accordingly.

Romero’s courage moved millions of people, who proclaimed him a saint after his assassination. The time has come for America’s clergy to rise to that level of courage and issue a “call to conscience” to ICE agents in their congregations that they consider resigning their jobs because of ICE’s ongoing human rights abuses.

No one disputes the need for a fair immigration system that meets U.S. constitutional standards and international human rights principles and, for Christians, is consistent with the Gospel. Nor can one dispute that ICE operations abuse, and are repugnant to, these norms, for which ICE makes no apologies.

Roving patrols of ICE agents with masked faces have seized thousands of people, young and old, across the country, at home, work, driving, and on sidewalks, and shoved them into unmarked SUVs. They have upended nursing home and home care staff, disrupted crop harvesting, and arrest people near schools and churches. Parents are suddenly ripped from their children, and children yanked from foster homes. Asylum-seekers are imprisoned when they show up for hearings—no due process, just random deportation to countries foreign to them.

Countless videos attest to ICE’s inhumane conduct. The Guardian published a video of ICE using a stun gun on a worker and slamming him to the ground. When his companion, a citizen, says, “Don’t resist” to diffuse the situation, they arrest him for interfering with his friend’s arrest. The agents are laughing. One says, “They’re starting to resist more now,” to which another replies: “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.” The callousness of that flippant remark, unrebuked by ICE, is telling and frightening; it reflects ICE’s culture.

Almost 57,000 people are incarcerated in ICE detention centers nationwide. Human rights reports and the media paint a brutal picture of cruelty. “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades, which officials inaugurated with disgusting mirth, is particularly inhumane. Neither it nor other centers meet the standards for U.S. jails and prisons: unsanitary conditions, denial of access to lawyers, family, and clergy; overcrowding; scarce medical attention. Deaths have occurred.

ICE agents cannot justify their actions as “just following orders.” The Nuremberg trials of Nazis rejected that rationalization. Under international law, “just following orders” never justifies being part of the machinery of human rights abuse; nor is it ever consistent with the Gospel of Jesus.

Some Catholic bishops are speaking out, Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville for one. The presiding U.S. Episcopal bishop, Sean Rowe, has declared, “Once the church of presidents, the Episcopal Church must now be an engine of resistance.” Texas Episcopal Bishop Andy Doyle as pointed in the direction of the Confessing Church, which formed in 1934 Germany to oppose the regime’s human rights violations when other church leaders were subservient to Hitler’s anti-Jewish nationalist agenda.

Verbal remonstrations by bishops are good but inadequate. Some bishops have attended detention hearings in solidarity with immigrants; but, of the country’s 500 Catholic and Episcopal bishops, that number is infinitesimal.

People like the Dorothea Project moms are imploring the bishops to do more. They need to take the Archbishop Romero step and issue a “call to conscience,” suggesting to ICE employees that the time has come for them to resign their positions and find other employment. The more resignations of conscience, the quicker humane immigration reform.

Bishops must bring the moral issue to the fore. Cautiousness in this situation is perilous and harmful. They must pose the tough question of ICE agents who profess Christianity: how do you square this maltreatment of people’s human rights and their dignity with your conscience and the Gospel? How can you work for a police agency that so badly and cruelly treats people who have lived good and honest lives after escaping persecution, terror, or sheer economic necessity? How can you again endanger them and return them to where they had to flee?

As Jesus put it, no person can serve two masters.

MSF calls on governments in the region to shift away from harsh deterrence tactics and towards humane migration and protection policy.

Mexico City, 12 August 2025 - In its first six months in office, the current US Administration has implemented the most restrictive and dehumanising migration policy seen in years, abandoning hundreds of thousands of people hoping to seek asylum in the US and leaving them stranded in danger in Mexico and Central America, says a new report by the international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF).

The report highlights how the US government’s policies and rhetoric criminalising migration have echoed throughout Latin America. MSF calls on all governments across the Americas to renounce deterrence and abandonment tactics and instead implement humane policies that ensure access to asylum, medical care, and protection along the Latin American migration corridor.

“These policies, combined with the drastic reduction of aid and the humanitarian footprint along the migration route, have had a devastating impact on the wellbeing of people trying to seek safety,” says Franking Frías, Deputy Manager of Operations for MSF in Mexico and Central America. “This suffering is deliberately made invisible, hidden by the inaccurate narrative that migration has stopped. But every day, we see the consequences in patients who are living with untreated injuries, trauma from sexual violence, and severe mental health conditions that make their daily life impossible.”

Released today, the report, 'Unwelcome. The devastating human impact of migration policy changes in the United States, Mexico and Central America', showcases how recent policy changes have eroded the right to seek asylum and left many migrants and asylum seekers stranded with nowhere safe to go, trapping them in a cycle of physical, emotional, and institutional violence. The report is based on analysis of MSF medical data and in-depth interviews with patients of many nationalities in various stages of migration, and with MSF staff working along the migration route in Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.

Since late January, the US government has closed the main avenues to request asylum and protection—including shutting down the CBP One application and ending humanitarian parole— heightened security at the border with Mexico, and deported people in unconscionable conditions, including deporting people in shackles, sending deportees to third countries, and separating families.

“We feel abandoned and unprotected,” says a Honduran woman who is stuck in Reynosa, in northern Mexico. “We never wanted to enter the United States illegally. We ask for benevolence for cases like mine: mothers who have been waiting for a long time with children, who want to give them a better life. We have already gone through a process; we already had a right. We have been victims of scams, the cartels, we have been deceived, we are traumatized.” The woman had secured an appointment through CBP One for three days after the app was shut down and all appointments were cancelled.

On top of this, several countries across the Latin American migration corridor have also strengthened deterrence measures. Law enforcement agents and immigration authorities in the region have forcefully returned migrants, restricted people’s movements, and dismantled urban camps where people with nowhere else to go were sheltering. They have closed migration reception stations, dissolved gatherings in public spaces, carried out raids, arbitrarily detained people, increased patrolling, and complicated and reduced access to bureaucratic procedures—including asylum processes.

“We were held captive for 60 days,” says a Venezuelan man stranded in Ciudad Juárez, northern Mexico. “[Criminals] hit me on the head, pulled a tooth, and shoved a gun in my mouth to take pictures and call one of my sons in the United States. My son and son-in-law paid the ransom, and we were released. The plan was to go to the United States. The rest of my family is there waiting for us. But with this US government, we don't know what to do.”

Carmen López, MSF Manager for Mobile Health Activities, shares the story of a Venezuelan patient she assisted in Guatemala. The man and his son were deported earlier this year from the US, despite having entered through CBP One: “First, they were held in a detention centre in the United States separately for about 20 days. Later, they were deported to Mexico. During the transfer to the Mexican authorities, his backpack containing personal items and savings was stolen. They were left in Villahermosa [a town in southeastern Mexico]. They had to start their return [to Venezuela] without money. He was very frustrated because he had gone through the legal process, and it had all been a lie in the end.”

For many, returning to their country is not an option, either because of a lack of financial resources or fear of what they fled in the first place—such as, the political and economic crises in Venezuela or Cuba, rife violence in Haiti, conflict in peripheral regions of Colombia, or threats from criminal groups and a lack of opportunities in Ecuador and other Central American countries. “We were given a 24-hour ultimatum to pay an amount of money we didn’t have,” says a Salvadoran woman in Tapachula, southern Mexico. “Migrating was neither a political choice nor a search for better economic opportunities. It was an urgent decision to save our lives.”

With seeking asylum at the United States southern border now close to impossible, tens of thousands of people are seeing Mexico as the only alternative option. But MSF teams witness how asylum procedures in Mexico have become lengthier and more complex in several cities. In parallel, violence perpetrated by organised crime groups and other actors remains alarming, including kidnappings, extortion, robberies, sexual violence, and labour exploitation. “Violence is much more evident now,” says Ricardo Santiago, who coordinated MSF programmes in northern and southern Mexico. “Before—given the large number of people on the move—some would be spared, whereas today most of the people I've spoken with have been victims of violence. There is no escape.”

MSF teams in the region, particularly in Mexico, have seen an increase in psychological needs among patients and a high proportion of people with severe mental health issues despite a reduction of medical activities since the slowing of migration flows. In recent years, many patients have had an obvious need for mental health support because of the recurrent violence suffered and the precarious living conditions endured along the migration route. But on top of these experiences, people now face uncertainty provoked by the drastic and numerous policy changes, which trigger despair once people realize that all they endured to reach the US was in vain.

“The symptoms are increasingly intense,” says Lucía Samayoa, MSF Project Coordinator in Tapachula. “They're living under a lot of pressure and stress. Many people require pharmacological treatment, with a more structured, longer therapeutic process.”

Moreover, stranded migrants and asylum seekers have dispersed, becoming more invisible —due to fear of prosecution, detention, and deportation in the midst of a stigmatising environment, in which they are repeatedly labelled as criminals.

“Today, migrants are less accessible and the humanitarian system is unprepared to effectively address their vulnerabilities and complex needs,” says Frías. “Behind every policy is its impact on real people: survivors of torture, families escaping danger, and children navigating border crossings alone. Their health, safety, and dignity are legal and moral obligations. All governments in the region must act now to protect, not punish, people in search of safety, and create safe immigration pathways.”

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney based in Georgia, says that Trump is intentionally “overwhelming” immigration courts.
Lawyers such as Kuck and several former immigration judges told me the Trump administration is undermining immigration courts across the board, from firing immigration judges to detaining more immigrants, leading to a backlog in courts.
But that norm is being destroyed, say many immigration attorneys and several former immigration judges.
“The immigration courts have proven so many people to be U.S. citizens after ICE has arrested them.","The immigration court system was already strained when Donald Trump took office in January. Since then, he’s taken dramatic steps to undermine it even further.

Over the last seven months, Trump has fired immigration judges, weakened due process rights for those facing deportation and pressured judges to rule in the administration’s favor.

Some of those fired judges, immigration attorneys and other experts say the end result will be that these courts are either destroyed or left so dysfunctional that they can’t effectively guarantee basic rights.

Trump and his team have made clear that they value speed in immigration courts as agents try to meet an unrealistic goal of 1 million deportations in a year. After Republicans in Congress set aside a historic amount of money for deportations, border czar Tom Homan said he wanted to raise the 3,000 daily arrest quota to 7,000.

In theory, people facing deportation should have a chance to make their case before a judge, with proceedings taking months or years in some cases. But now, with a little more than 600 immigration judges, down from roughly 735, they are getting less time and ability to do that.

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney based in Georgia, says that Trump is intentionally “overwhelming” immigration courts.

“It appears what they’re doing is moving forward with a plan to eliminate due process and immigration judges,” Kuck said. “The due process system created over the last 50 years is frustrating their goal of deporting a million people because it’s physically impossible to have a million cases go through immigration court in one year.”

Trump has cast doubt on the need for due process for undocumented immigrants.

Trump himself has even cast doubt on the need for due process for undocumented immigrants.

“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,” the president said in April, claiming it would require “hundreds of thousands” of hearing.

Lawyers such as Kuck and several former immigration judges told me the Trump administration is undermining immigration courts across the board, from firing immigration judges to detaining more immigrants, leading to a backlog in courts. The result is that a long troubled system is now near a breaking point.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson argued that new funding approved for the court system in Trump’s megabill will help with the backlog.

“There are currently efforts underway to hire additional immigration judges,” Jackson said. “Illegal aliens going through removal proceedings receive more than sufficient amounts of due process — anyone suggesting otherwise is lying. Any illegal alien who wishes to avoid deportations can self-deport.”

Some $3.3 billion in funding was approved for immigration courts in the megabill, but the law also placed a cap of 800 immigration judges — a number considered far too small to efficiently process the nearly 4 million pending immigration cases. Most experts say the system would need 2,000 to 3,000 judges to process the cases efficiently and fairly.

That same bill guaranteed some $45 billion for immigration detention, and nearly $30 billion for enforcement, including the hiring and training of some 10,000 new ICE agents

Immigration judges are technically employees of the executive branch under the Justice Department, but for the past roughly 50 years, judges have operated with independence and decided cases without interference.

But that norm is being destroyed, say many immigration attorneys and several former immigration judges.

Recently, ICE and the Justice Department declared millions of undocumented immigrants are not eligible for bond release from detention as their cases are processed — a change to nearly 40 years of precedent followed by immigration judges to guarantee due process. Historically, denial of bond was applied to people who recently crossed the border, not longtime residents regardless of documentation status. The Homeland Security Department did not respond to a request for comment about the change.

Victor Nieblas, a longtime immigration attorney in Los Angeles and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said denial of bond is a tactic to increase deportations.

“The longer you’re detained, the easier it’ll be for you to decide ‘I’d rather go home,’ and so you sign a voluntary return or a voluntary deportation,” he said.

Since January, roughly 106 immigration judges have either been fired by the Trump administration, resigned, or were transferred to another part of the Justice Department, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.

One fired judge, who requested anonymity fearing retaliation from the administration, said the cuts showed the Trump administration wants immigration courts to “collapse.”

“It’s never been like this before,” said the former judge, who had served for years under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Jennifer Peyton, a recently fired assistant chief immigration judge in Chicago, said the administration is pressuring understaffed judges to speed up their decisions.

Judges have been told they should decide each case within a single hearing block, which runs from two to three hours.

Instead of taking time to conduct research on the legal questions in a case, judges have been told they should decide each case within a single hearing block, which runs from two to three hours.

“You’re creating an environment for the remaining judges where I’m sure everyone’s looking over their shoulder, worried they’ll be fired,” Peyton said. “They are definitely trying to make the system stop working.”

George Pappas, a Boston immigration judge fired last month, said the “drumbeat” started in February. He was told by his superiors to “be careful” with how he ruled and speed up dismissals of pending cases, which would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest an undocumented immigrant and put the person in an expedited removal without a hearing.

“That direct pressure undermined my ability to rule neutrally,” Pappas said. It all added “a layer of self policing,” he said, saying that would lead to a “total eradication” of the current system.

A Justice Department official did not answer questions about the accusations leveled by immigration judges who were fired by the Trump administration. Instead, the DOJ official accused the Biden administration of pressuring immigration judges to make certain decisions, and said the Trump administration is looking to hire judges who will expeditiously reduce the backlog of cases.

After the passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, the earlier version of immigration courts required that cases be decided by “special inquiry officers” who were not required to be lawyers, as they are now. In 1973, immigration judges were created by regulation.

Asked whether the administration wants to change the required qualifications for immigration judges, both the White House and the Justice Department declined to answer.

If the system reverts, hiring standards could be changed and loyal Trump officials could become judge and jury, Kuck said.

But to do so would likely set off legal challenges. And immigration policy experts warn a broken due process system for undocumented immigrants will impact Americans as well.

“Getting rid of due process is a threat to everyone in the United States who’s here legally or who is a citizen,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies for the CATO Institute. “The immigration courts have proven so many people to be U.S. citizens after ICE has arrested them. In terms of your rights, it matters that we have a system for reviewing whether someone is entitled to be in the United States or not.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-donald-trump-vl-1210p-2b01c1.jpg",N,,2025-08-12 17:57:08.261033

When it comes to the United States’ immigration policy, we’re beginning to see how bad things can get.

A story this week by the Idaho Statesman’s Carolyn Komatsoulis showed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are upping their game in Idaho, smashing a Meridian man’s car window to detain him.

At the same time, Idaho State Police have signed an agreement with ICE to join a “Task Force Model,” which uses racial profiling to let local police question people on the street about their immigration status, according to another Idaho Statesman story. Even though Gov. Brad Little said his orders to the State Police were limited to specific duties, the agreement still gives Idaho officers the power to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant, to arrest immigrants under certain conditions and to transport immigrants to detention facilities, according to the Statesman story.

Civil rights organizations are sounding the alarm over ICE’s obvious violations of constitutional rights, including U.S. citizens getting caught up in mass arrests and deportations, inhumane conditions for immigrants in federal prisons and unconstitutional raids.

Not to mention deporting detainees — without proper adjudication as to whether they are in the country without legal authorization — to foreign countries, including a brutal torture prison in El Salvador and the dangerous and inhumane establishment of “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.

You may be completely fine with all that, unconcerned with inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of human beings, including children. You may be fine with stray innocent bystanders getting caught in the wide net that’s been cast (as long as it’s not you, of course).

But consider this: A rough estimate by the University of Idaho’s McClure Center put Idaho’s workforce count at about 27,000 undocumented immigrants, mostly working in agriculture, construction and service industries.

Idaho industry professionals report that in agriculture, dairy and hospitality industries, businesses employ unauthorized workers to meet their labor needs because authorized workers cannot be found.

So what happens if Trump fulfills his campaign promise — with the help of Idaho State Police — and rounds up nearly 27,000 undocumented immigrants in Idaho?

Employers in agriculture, construction and service industries are going to be in a world of hurt, to say the least. The people Republican leaders believe are out there lining up to take these jobs exist only in their minds.

Finding workers is already a key concern for Idaho businesses today, according to the U of I report, even with undocumented workers. These businesses report that they have to adapt to the lack of workers by forgoing business growth opportunities, cutting back production or even closing, according to the U of I report.

This doesn’t even include the contributions that undocumented immigrant workers make to Idaho’s economy through their spending and taxes.

Those contributions “are likely in the billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs,” according to the report.

Despite recent poor jobs reports, the United States still faces a labor shortage in the millions.

Rounding up and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could have a devastating effect on the economy, perhaps none more so than Idaho’s.

But maybe that’s what it’s going to take for Congress to do its job and adopt immigration reform.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson’s Farm Workforce Modernization Act would be a good place to start. It would create a pathway to legal status by creating a category called Certified Agricultural Worker for undocumented farmworkers who have done at least 180 days of agricultural work over the past two years.

It would reform the H-2A Guestworker Program by expanding eligibility to include dairy and other year-round agricultural work, and by adding flexibility for employers.

It would still require employers to attempt recruiting U.S. workers first before using the H-2A program, and establish a mandatory E-Verify system for agricultural employment to ensure future workers are authorized to work legally.

An earlier version of the bill passed the House with bipartisan support, but it got nowhere in the Senate.

Perhaps things weren’t bad enough.

The U.S. has been skating along like this for decades, with an untenable and unsustainable immigration policy, blindly looking the other way while undocumented immigrants do work that other Americans won’t do, spend money that bolsters the economy and pay taxes that help to provide government services.

If we let President Trump and ICE continue with this reckless, inhumane and unconstitutional deportation crusade, we’re going to see just how bad it can get.

Maybe that’s what it will take to get Congress to fix our broken immigration system.

In letters sent to the chief judges of five federal district courts last week, the Reporters Committee expressed concerns about Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(c), a little-known rule that blocks public access to immigration case filings via PACER, the electronic system for federal court records, forcing journalists to visit the courthouse to view them in person.

“This restriction prevents timely public access to fast-moving legal developments and impedes the ability of the press to report on critical, newsworthy matters,” the Reporters Committee argues in the letters, which were sent to federal courts in New York, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. “Timely public access to judicial records is not just good public policy — it is a matter of constitutional importance.”

The letters note that the Reporters Committee regularly hears from journalists who struggle to cover developments in immigration cases because of the rule’s restrictions. Additionally, the letters argue that the rule’s restriction on access is both too broad and too narrow to reasonably serve its purported goal of protecting sensitive information.

Federal courts have the authority to lift Rule 5.2(c) access restrictions. In June, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit removed restrictions in the case of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University scholar who is challenging whether his detention was legal.

Is it still possible to obtain Italian citizenship iure sanguinis?","The Constitutional Court has ruled on Citizenship by descent. Discover the impact of Judgment 142/2025 and what it means for applicants.

With Judgment no. 142, filed on 31 July 2025, the Italian Constitutional Court dismissed the questions of constitutionality raised by the Courts of Bologna, Rome, Milan and Florence, which had sought to place limits and additional requirements on the automatic recognition of citizenship for the children of Italians born abroad.

The question put to the Court

The referring Courts challenged Act 91/1992, arguing that it allows millions of people with no substantial ties to Italy, other than blood descent from an Italian ancestor, to obtain Citizenship.

The Act states that ""the child of an Italian father or mother is a citizen by birth"", imposing no limits beyond proof of lineage.

The Court was therefore asked whether it was legitimate to introduce further requirements.

What the Constitutional Court decided

The Court, considering the doubts unfounded, held that:

It is not its task to restrict citizenship by means of a ""manipulative"" judgment that would introduce conditions not set by Parliament;

The legislature enjoys wide discretion in determining the requirements for Citizenship;

The current provisions (subject to distinctions introduced by Act 74/2025) that accord citizenship to anyone who is the child of an Italian citizen do not breach the Constitution.

Accordingly, the Court declared:

complaints of unreasonableness and disproportionality inadmissible;

references to unproven international obligations inadmissible;

allegations of unequal treatment with other routes to citizenship unfounded.

Consequences of Judgment 142

The ruling:

does not affect Decree-Law 36/2025, which lay outside the issues decided;

clarifies that the new rules introduced in 2025 (Decree-Law 36/2025, converted into Act 74/2025) do not apply to cases pending before 28 March 2025.

Therefore:

Applications lodged before 28 March 2025 continue under the previous rules;

Applications submitted on or after that date are subject to stricter conditions (e.g. generational limits, proof that an ancestor resided in Italy).

For a closer look at the new criteria: Italian citizenship iure sanguinis—2025 new rules

Suspended proceedings must be resumed

Proceedings that had been stayed awaiting the Court's decision must now be resumed under the pre-2025 legislation.

Constitutional Court and Decree-Law 36/2025: the next step

A further question of constitutionality has been raised by the Turin Court against the 2025 reform.

A hearing is scheduled for the coming months, and the outcome could significantly change the current landscape.

When should you consult a lawyer?

The rules on Italian Citizenship, especially after the 2025 reforms, have become increasingly complex.

It is advisable to consult a law firm in order to:

confirm entitlement to Citizenship by descent or identify alternative routes;

prepare documentation correctly;

avoid errors in the application;

bring proceedings, if necessary, to secure recognition.

""All these people are angry. They have concerns. I have concerns. I could vote Democrat or Republican as long as I think they're doing something good for our country. But right now I don't see that happening with this, and that's why everybody's angry,"" Smith said.

LaMalfa was criticized for many of his votes in Congress, including his support in 2021 not to certify the 2020 election that ushered in Joe Biden as president and this year for backing President Trump and his many executive orders, which some on Monday said usurped power from Congress.

""You made a choice to violate your oath to the Constitution,"" Max Walter of Redding said, referring to LaMalfa's vote not to certify the 2020 presidential election. ""And every day since then, you have violated your oath. But you have loyalty, you have loyalty to a felon (Trump), to somebody who mocks people in wheelchairs, to someone who mocks women.""

On questions about tariffs, LaMalfa said he supported them, claiming they would bring jobs back to the U.S. He also said he supported release of the Epstein files, but wanted to make sure the names of victims aren't released.

Roy Reddin asked if LaMalfa supported the type of congressional redistricting that is proposed in Texas.

""Currently the Texas legislature is very close to to an epic gerrymandering where they are going to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters by realigning their districts. So my question to you, is in two parts: Do you support what the Texas legislature is doing and why should California not do the same thing for five seats, one of which could be yours,"" Reddin said.

Although redistricting congressional districts happen at the state level, LaMalfa said he opposed attempts at redistricting such as what is happening in Texas, where the state legislature has proposed redrawing congressional district maps.

The redistricting plan in Texas could lead to the state picking up an additional five Republican seats in Congress, helping the GOP retain a majority in the House next year.

But other states, including California, have vowed to re-draw congressional district boundaries, if Texas goes through with its plan.

Not everyone was critical of LaMalfa. One woman said she was an immigrant and she supports LaMalfa because he backs the Trump administration's actions against undocumented immigrants.

""He's an honest Christian man and he's fighting for us,"" one woman said.

One woman who spoke out said many of the issues that came up Monday were moral issues that transcended a political climate that has become too divisive.

""I'm afraid to stand up for my rights because I might get shot,"" she told LaMalfa, citing the shootings of state legislators in Minnesota this summer.

The Council for Global Equality (CGE) has accused the administration of a ""cover-up of a cover-up"" to keep the reports buried.

Each year, the department is required to report on the practices of other countries concerning individual, civil, political, and worker rights protected under international law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Governments and international groups have long cited these surveys as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative sources on the state of human rights, informing policy surrounding foreign aid and asylum.

The Foreign Assistance Act requires that these reports be sent to Congress by February 25 each year, and they are typically released in March or April. But nearly six months later, the Trump administration has sent nothing for the calendar year 2024.

Meanwhile, NPR reported in April on a State Department memo requiring employees to ""streamline"" the reports by omitting many of the most common human rights violations:

The reports... will no longer call governments out for such things as denying freedom of movement and peaceful assembly. They won't condemn retaining political prisoners without due process or restrictions on ""free and fair elections.""

Forcibly returning a refugee or asylum-seeker to a home country where they may face torture or persecution will no longer be highlighted, nor will serious harassment of human rights organizations...

...reports of violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people will be removed, along with all references to [diversity, equity, and inclusion] (DEI).

Among other topics ordered to be struck from the reports: involuntary or coercive medical or psychological practices, arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, serious restrictions to internet freedom, extensive gender-based violence, and violence or threats of violence targeting people with disabilities.

Last week, The Washington Post obtained leaked copies of the department's reports on nations favored by the Trump administration—El Salvador, Russia, and Israel. It found that they were ""significantly shorter"" than the reports released by the Biden administration and that they struck references to widely documented human rights abuses in these countries.

In the case of El Salvador, where the administration earlier this year began shipping immigrants deported from the United States, the department's report stated that were ""no credible reports of significant human rights abuses"" there, even though such abuses—including torture, physical violence, and deprivation have been widely reported, including by Trump's own deportees.

Human rights violations against LGBTQ+ people were deleted from the State Department's report on Russia, while the report on Israel deleted references to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial and to his government's threats to the country's independent judiciary.

""Secretary Rubio's overtly political rewriting of the human rights reports is a dramatic departure from even his own past commitment to protecting the fundamental human rights of LGBTQI+ people,"" said Keifer Buckingham, the Council for Global Equality's managing director. ""Strategic omission of these abuses is also directly in contravention to Congress's requirement of a 'full and complete report' regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights.""

In June, the CGE sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the State Department calling for all communications related to these decisions to be made public. The department acknowledged the request but refused to turn over any documents.

Andrea Velez was in downtown Los Angeles on June 24 when she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. She was charged with assaulting a federal officer while he was attempting to arrest a suspect.

The Department of Justice later dismissed her case without prejudice. The agency did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday.

Velez, who works as a production coordinator for a shoe company, recalled seeing federal agents when her mother and sister dropped her off at work.

“It was like a scene,” she told NBC Los Angeles. “They were just ready to attack and chase.”

Velez said she felt someone grab her and slam her to the ground. She said she tried to tell the agent, who was in plainclothes, that she was a citizen, but he told her that she “was interfering with what he was doing, so he was going to arrest me.”

“That’s when I asked him to show me his ID, his badge number,” she said. “I asked him if he had a warrant, and he said I didn’t need to know any of that.”

A federal criminal complaint alleged that an agent was chasing after a man, and Velez stepped into the agent’s path and extended her arm “in an apparent effort to prevent him from apprehending the male subject he was chasing.”

The complaint said that Velez’s arm hit the agent in the face.

Velez said she denied any wrongdoing and insisted she was a U.S. citizen. She was taken to a detention center in downtown Los Angeles where she gave officers her driver’s license and her health insurance card, but she was still booked into jail.

She said she spent two days in the detention center, where she had nothing to drink for 24 hours.

Velez said the ordeal traumatized her, and she has not been able to physically return to work.

“I’m taking things day by day,” she told the news station.

Her attorneys told NBC Los Angeles that they are exploring legal options against the federal government.

Her story echoes those of others who have said they were wrongfully detained by immigration agents under President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations.

Job Garcia, a Ph.D. student and photographer, said he was tackled and thrown to the ground by immigration agents for recording a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles.

DC Circuit vacates judge's order to hold US in contempt for ignoring TRO blocking immigrant removals

A federal appeals court has vacated an order by a Washington, D.C., federal judge that found probable cause to hold the federal government in criminal contempt for violating his order blocking the removal of a group of immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated an April 16 order by Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg of the District of Columbia in a 2-1 per curiam decision Friday.

How Appealing links to the Aug. 8 decision and links to news coverage, including stories by the New York Times and the Washington Times.

The immigrants were taken to a prison in El Salvador in Central America but were later transferred to Venezuela, according to the New York Times.

D.C. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas and D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, appointees of President Donald Trump during his first term, wrote separate concurring opinions with differing reasons for their decision to vacate Boasberg’s probable cause order. D.C. Circuit Judge Corneila T.L. Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, dissented.

In a commentary at the Volokh Conspiracy, Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said his quick reading of the opinions leads him to think that Boasberg “on remand would have jurisdiction to proceed with some form of criminal contempt,” minus a “purge” option that drew objections from Rao.

Boasberg had said the federal government could purge itself of contempt by giving the immigrants a chance to challenge their removal in a habeas proceeding by asserting custody over them.

Boasberg issued the probable cause order, which included the purge option, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled April 7 that the immigrants’ case had been filed in the wrong venue. Boasberg said the Supreme Court decision, which lifted his temporary restraining order, “does not excuse the government’s violation.”

Rao, however, said Boasberg lost authority to coerce compliance with his order after the Supreme Court vacated it. She went on to say punishment through contempt “might still be available in these circumstances, but the district court cannot use the threat of such punishment as a backdoor to obtain compliance with a vacated and therefore unenforceable TRO.”

The dissent would not have vacated Boasberg’s probable cause order, while Katsas said he would vacate the order and terminate the criminal contempt proceeding.

Katsas said the case could be resolved based on ambiguities that resulted in different interpretations of Boasberg’s order.

The government had contended that the order banned removal of the immigrants from U.S. territory, but that had happened before he entered the TRO. Boasberg, however, said the order barred removal of the immigrants from U.S. custody, and his order was likely violated by their transfer to El Salvadoran custody.

The ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the party accused of contempt, Katsas said.

Although Katsas thought that the case could be resolved based on ambiguity, he also said Boasberg acted “to vindicate a TRO that the Supreme Court had vacated for lack of jurisdiction.”

He said Boasberg’s order “raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses. And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.”

The federal department publicly criticized U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D) in a press release after he visited Farmville Detention Center on Friday. It accused him of prioritizing detainees with criminal convictions over crime victims.

“He continues to do the bidding of dangerous criminal illegal aliens that endanger his own constituents,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “When will Congressman Beyer meet with the American victims of these illegal aliens’ violent crimes?”

Beyer fired back via a spokesperson on social media, criticizing conditions at the detention facility about an hour and 15 minutes southwest of Richmond.

“Federal regulations require minimum standards of care for all detainees, and unfortunately the medical resources at this facility were clearly woefully inadequate to meet those standards,” Aaron Fritschner, Beyer’s deputy chief of staff, said on X.

“Improving these conditions would be a far better use of time for the staff of the Department of Homeland Security than attacking Members of Congress for doing their jobs by engaging in oversight of the Executive Branch.”

Beyer, who had been talking about visiting Farmville for months, requested to meet “a number of detainees” at the detention center. They included people who had been kept in solitary confinement, who had recently experienced mental health crises and who had faced long delays in getting access to crucial medical treatment, Fritschner said.

DHS said that the detainees also included people convicted of assault and battery, burglary, distribution of drugs and driving under the influence. The agency claims that two of them are gang members, although only one detainee is listed as having a conviction for gang participation.

In an interview with the local news site WRIC, Beyer described “an enormous medical burden” at the detention center, which he said has only one physician and is struggling to get more nurses.

“Rep. Beyer also met with an older man who was detained by ICE when he went to his green card interview,” Fritschner told ARLnow. “DHS did not include this man in their list, but it’s the kind of case that has so many people in our community upset about what DHS and ICE are doing.”

Beyer told WRIC that “maybe as many as three quarters” of detainees at the center “only have a civil reason for being there.”

DHS disputes this, claiming that 66% of people detained at the center have been either charged or convicted of crimes in the United States.",https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20250501_193747234.MP_.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 12:58:37.738820

NSGB is the U.S.’s oldest overseas military installation, but it was not the first.
With all this in mind, Congress surely understood the risk that the U.S. military could be used for civilian law enforcement purposes abroad.
This is true even if doing so provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement.
NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. On that basis alone, U.S. laws should apply there.","On Jan. 29, President Trump issued an executive order directing the expansion of the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay (NSGB) for “high-priority criminal aliens.” Since then, approximately 500 migrants—initially apprehended in the U.S.—have been detained at NSGB, and another 9,000 are being vetted for transfer. Detainees are under the supervision of the U.S. military and have been housed both in the MOC and at Camp Six—which at one point held alleged members of al-Qaeda. While the military is reportedly only acting in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the facts suggest their role is more “direct [and] active.” This raises the important possibility that the administration is violating the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). This article outlines how the use of the U.S. military to supervise the detention of migrants at NSGB would violate the PCA, analyzes whether such a violation is actionable, and presents possible remedies.

The PCA

The PCA prohibits using “any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws[,]” but the law is unclear about what uses of military personnel are improper, and it leaves out entirely the issue of extraterritoriality. The first question has largely been fleshed out by the courts, leaving us with three tests for actions that “execute the laws”: first, any military act that is “regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature and causes the citizens to be presently or prospectively subject to regulations, proscriptions, or compulsions imposed by military authority”; second, “the direct active participation of federal military troops in law enforcement activities”; and third, “any [military] activities that pervade the activities of civilian law enforcement officials.” See also Bissonette v. Haig, United States v. Redfeather, and United States v. Jaramillo.

The use of “citizen” may seem problematic in the current context—which involves noncitizens—but the issue can be easily dispatched with because the term, as used in Bissonette, seems to be a colloquial distinction of petitioners from civilian law enforcement officers (LEOs) and the military. It is doubtful that this distinction has any real significance because the PCA is a criminal statute; as with all criminal statutes, the focus is on the acts and intent of the person accused of violating it—not on the victim.

Civilian LEOs assigned to correctional facilities exercise power that is regulatory, proscriptive, and compulsory by any typical understanding of those words, and consistent with how they were applied in Bissonette. These LEOs restrict the detainees’ freedom of movement, often using armed guards along the perimeter of a facility. The presence of guards is direct, as defined in Redfeather, because it involves personnel rather than just equipment. The personnel’s role is also active, as defined in Redfeather, because it involves searches, seizures of contraband and other evidence, and the pursuit of escaped detainees, and it may involve criminal investigations and the interrogation of witnesses. If these tasks are performed by uniformed members of the military, or even civilian employees of the Defense Department, it could constitute a PCA violation.

Declarations by both detainees and members of the military—filed in Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem and Espinoza Escalona v. Noem—show that the military is being used in violation of the PCA. Mirroring Bissonette’s use of military personnel and resources to create roadblocks and an armed perimeter for the purpose of confining the citizens of Wounded Knee, NSGB employs military personnel and Camp Six’s walls to similarly contain noncitizen detainees in a manner that is regulatory, proscriptive, and compulsory.

Second, the military’s role here is both direct and active. Rather than merely engaging in a protective service of federal assets or providing assistance to civilian law enforcement, service members are engaging in strip searches, restraining detainees for out-of-cell movement, cell searches, direct supervision, serving food, and regulating and supervising phone use.

Finally, the military presence at Camp Six likely pervades that of civilian law enforcement. ICE “cannot be said to have been ‘lawfully engaged’ in the ‘lawful performance’ of their official duties” because those duties had been overtaken by the military. As of February, 900 service members were deployed to NSGB. The “Guard Force” at Camp Six consists of 28 soldiers, seven or eight Akima contractors, and only two ICE agents per shift. All three of the tests for what it means to “execute the law” are met, meaning that the PCA has been violated.

(Extra)territorial Application

No cases have addressed whether the PCA applies extraterritorially. As assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, William Barr opined that the PCA does not apply outside the territory of the U.S. However, that memo was written in 1989, and NSGB has undergone significant changes since then. The memo was written before NSGB was used as temporary housing for HIV-positive migrants interdicted at sea, 9/11, and the Bush administration’s expansion of NSGB to house enemy combatant detainees.

For these reasons, the memo’s rationale is less persuasive and is certainly non-dispositive. Below I address this issue in two parts: First, I argue that PCA violations at NSGB are actionable because NSGB is territorial; second, I argue that PCA violations committed at NSGB should be actionable even if it is considered extraterritorial.

The Case for Territoriality

NSGB is the United States’s oldest overseas military installation. It is located within the sovereign territory of Cuba but has been under the legal jurisdiction and control of the U.S. since 1903. The treaty contains no termination date and has no provision for unilateral termination, effectively making it an indefinite lease agreement. The treaty does not expressly limit the uses of the land, but it also does not contemplate the detention of migrants apprehended within the U.S. Rather, it expressly says that the lease is to be used for coaling and a naval station. This traditional use was precisely how NSGB was used until the 1990s. Until now, no non-U.S. territory—including NSGB—has ever been used to detain migrants who were first apprehended and detained within the U.S.

The clearest reason why the PCA should apply at NSGB is that it is a de facto territory of the U.S., a fact the government concedes. According to the government, “there is no Cuban government presence at NSGB and no way for Cuban authorities to exercise any control over the detainees.” Additionally, “while [the detainees] have physically departed the [U.S.] …[,] DHS has not completed the removal mission and has certainly not surrendered them to the control of the Cuban government.” The government went on to cite the finding in Boumediene v. Bush that NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. As a de facto territory, NSGB is legally indistinguishable—for the purposes of applying the U.S. Constitution and statutes—from Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

In Boumediene, the Supreme Court held that noncitizen detainees at NSGB can challenge their detention with a writ of habeas. Although the issue of habeas is not entirely analogous with the question posed here, Boumediene remains relevant because it addresses the extent to which the laws of the U.S. apply to noncitizen detainees housed at NSGB. It is especially on point because the Court’s reasoning relied on the degree of objective control that the U.S. asserted over an otherwise foreign territory.

The Court observed that “questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.” Speaking to these factors, the Court noted that, since the U.S. has had complete and uninterrupted control of NSGB for more than 100 years, under an indefinite lease it would be impossible for the political branches to govern it without legal constraints. NSGB is “no transient possession. In every practical sense [NSGB] is not abroad; it is within the constant jurisdiction of the [U.S.]” The Court also held that “the detainees … are held in a territory that, while technically not part of the [U.S.], is under the complete and total control of our government.” As this concept relates to the general circumstances of the U.S.’s control over NSGB, and not solely habeas, this characterization of the territory ought to apply equally to questions of PCA violations occurring at NSGB.

Notably, this expansion of what is considered U.S. territory would not extend to all foreign facilities operated by the U.S. military. In Al Maqaleh v. Gates, the court remarked that “while it is certainly realistic to assert that the [U.S.] has de facto sovereignty over [NSGB], the same simply is not true with respect to Bagram[, Afghanistan].” Bagram was an active war zone at the time of the case, and the U.S. does not hold the same type of indefinite lease agreement with Afghanistan as it does with Cuba.

The Case for Extraterritoriality

Even if NSGB is not territorial, the PCA should still apply. Congress is silent on the matter, and no court has spoken on the issue. This creates a presumption against extraterritoriality, but presumptions are not insurmountable. Other U.S. laws without explicit extraterritoriality provisions are applied there. Aside from Boumediene extending the right of habeas to detainees at NSGB—and the subsequent filings of statutory habeas petitions by and for both enemy combatant and migrant detainees—there is also case law illustrating that criminal statutes can be applied to conduct committed at NSGB. Also relevant is the hope that the government is using some lawful basis to detain individuals at NSGB in the first place.

Criminal Statutes

Capt. John Nettleton—a former Guantanamo commander—was charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2), for making false statements at NSGB. Congressional intent for extraterritoriality had previously been read into § 1001 and, for the same reasons, the same should be done for the PCA. In United States v. Walczak, the court based its reasoning on the nationality principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the text, and the rationale in United States v. Bowman.

First, the nationality principle holds that a state has jurisdiction over its citizens for crimes committed outside of its territory. Under this principle, even if NSGB is outside of U.S. territory, those violating the PCA at NSGB would still be under U.S. jurisdiction for criminal offenses because they are U.S. citizens.

Second, the PCA reads in its entirety:

Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

While perhaps less clear, there are similarities between the PCA and § 1001. Walczak focused on the phrase “Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department of agency of the [U.S.]” and held that § 1001 applied to the false statements made on Customs forms without regard to the place where the offense occurred because the Department of the Treasury is a “department of the [U.S.]” Similarly the PCA focuses on “departments”—or rather branches of the U.S. military. While the text is not dispositive, it suggests that the location is irrelevant because the criminal conduct is the improper use of military branches and the branches—or “departments”—are necessarily deployed all over the world.

Third, in Bowman, the Court noted that to limit the

locus [of certain offenses] to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute, and leave open a large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home. In such cases, Congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries, but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense.

NSGB is the U.S.’s oldest overseas military installation, but it was not the first. In fact, in 1867, Congress was planning on using Midway Island in much the same way that NSGB was traditionally used—as a naval station and coaling depot. The Senate also consented to a treaty in 1878 that would have permitted a naval station to be built in Samoa. The PCA was enacted that same year—showing that Congress was contemplating overseas military installations and the PCA at the same time.

In 2021, Congress added the Space Force to the enumerated branches of the PCA. In doing so, they necessarily contemplated not just extraterritorial—but extraterrestrial—use of military power. Also relevant is that at this time, the U.S. operated around 750 foreign-based military installations, and the function of NSGB had been expanded to include temporary housing for HIV-positive migrants and long-term detention of enemy combatant detainees. With all this in mind, Congress surely understood the risk that the U.S. military could be used for civilian law enforcement purposes abroad. Knowing that, Congress did not create new exceptions or repeal the PCA. It chose to expand it.

Just like in Bowman, Congress’s intent can be inferred because the scope and usefulness of the PCA would be greatly curtailed if the U.S. could choose to move a class of persons to a foreign based military installation in order to avoid sanction for actions which—if committed within the territorial U.S.—would constitute a violation of the PCA. Otherwise, the large number of foreign-based military installations would enable immunity for violations committed in foreign countries. And, as the military is deployed worldwide and the statute criminalizes an improper use of the enumerated branches, congressional intent for extraterritoriality can be inferred from the nature of the offense. Put together, the nationality principle, the text, and the Bowman rationale weigh toward the PCA overcoming the presumption against extraterritoriality.

Basis for Detention

It is unclear what authority is being used to justify migrant detention at NSGB—it does not come from a specific act of Congress, and it was not within the contemplated uses found within the treaties with Cuba. Statements made by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, indicating that detention would be temporary pending deportation unless other countries would not accept the migrants, suggest that this authority comes from 8 U.S.C. §1537(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. §1231(a)(2)(A), or 8 U.S.C. §1231(g)(1). Critically, no provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) has an extraterritorial provision.

Military Purpose Doctrine

The Military Purpose Doctrine is important to consider as a possible exception to the PCA. It authorizes the military to actively participate in direct law enforcement activities when done for the primary purpose of furthering a Defense Department or foreign affairs function of the U.S. This is true even if doing so provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement. But using the U.S. military to supervise detention of migrant detainees at NSGB is not just an incidental benefit.

This is clear from the recent use of the military in Los Angeles. By carefully limiting the permissible role of federalized troops in California to “protect[ing] the safety and security of federal functions, personnel, and property,” the government has shown us that illegal immigration is primarily a civilian law enforcement activity. Though they accompany ICE agents on immigration raids, military service members are present only to protect federal law enforcement and assist by establishing a security perimeter. They cannot conduct law enforcement activities. This point has been made time and time again—in social media posts, news reports, official statements, and court filings.

The government has also demonstrated that detention on a military installation is a civilian law enforcement activity. Large swaths of land along the U.S.-Mexico border have been designated as military installations and, while soldiers can temporarily detain trespassers there, they must turn them over when an appropriate law enforcement entity can assume custody.

Remedies

The available facts show that the PCA is likely being violated. Ubi jus, ibi remedium—for every wrong there is a remedy. Here, violators face the criminal sanctions enumerated in the statute and/or a variety of civil actions including ultra vires claims and habeas relief. A civil rights action may also be appropriate, but the probability of success is minimal. Because the guilty actors are federal instead of state agents, the suit would have to be brought as a Bivens action rather than a § 1983 suit. Bivens, however, will not be discussed at length here, as the Supreme Court has drastically limited Bivens actions and the probability of success is miniscule.

Ultra Vires Claim

An ultra vires claim can be brought, despite sovereign immunity, when the plaintiff brings suit against an official in their official capacity, can show that the official acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act, and seeks a prospective relief other than monetary damages. This is illustrated by a parallel case. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has brought an ultra vires claim arguing that the way the National Guard is being used in Los Angeles either amounts to or creates the risk of an imminent PCA violation.

Turning to the case at NSGB, neither the plaintiffs in Espinoza Escalona v. Noem nor those in Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem brought claims related to the PCA—but they could have, because in both cases, officials have likely exceeded their authority, in violation of the PCA, by housing noncitizen detainees under military supervision. While petitioners could not seek monetary damages through an ultra vires claim, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against future transfers would be appropriate, as both are proscriptive remedies.

Injunctive Relief

Emergency injunctive relief is proper to prevent additional transfers to NSGB. The question is to what extent it can be applied. Hundreds of cases have been filed against the Trump administration, and the scope of emergency injunctive relief has been a cornerstone issue. The Supreme Court recently kiboshed universal injunctions, which might suggest that each person has to file their own lawsuit to obtain relief—even if the wrong spawns from an executive order affecting millions of people. Fortunately the Court has left open several avenues for widespread relief: Plaintiffs may be able to certify nationwide classes; the Administrative Procedure Act might enable courts to set aside unlawful actions; and states could either file in state court and obtain nationwide injunctions upon showing of a “patchwork” of individual injunctions is insufficient to protect their interests or file a suit against the government directly in the Supreme Court.

Habeas

Habeas is the mechanism used to challenge legality or duration of confinement. Habeas jurisdiction is proper here for two reasons: Migrant detainees are “in custody under or by color of the authority of the [U.S],” and they are “in custody in violation of the … laws … of the [U.S.]”—namely the PCA. Additionally, the detainees here are in “the immediate physical custody of American forces who answer only to an American chain of command.” For these reasons, habeas relief should be granted and migrant detainees at NSGB should be released—whether that be into the U.S. or by removal to another country.

***

It would be patently unlawful to use the military in this way within U.S. borders; it is dangerous to suggest that by removing detainees to a black site in the Caribbean the government is allowed to act with impunity. NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. On that basis alone, U.S. laws should apply there. But even supposing this is not true, there is reason to believe that the PCA should be interpreted to apply extraterritorially. In either case, there are remedies available for the migrants who have been, are, or will be detained under these conditions at NSGB.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-12 12:59:04.779627

Several other felony charges were tacked on due to Momand having underage friends in the backseat, but the charges were ultimately dropped by Henrico prosecutors. The case was resolved — Momand pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and reckless driving — with no jail time ordered by the judge.

But he wound up at Riverside Regional Jail that night anyway. Moments after his court hearing on Friday he was picked up by immigration officers. Over the weekend, the agency transferred Momand to a detention facility in Farmville, where he remained on Monday.

Momand arrived in the U.S. with his family in the aftermath of the military’s hectic exit from Afghanistan in 2021, according to his immigration attorney, Miriam Airington-Fisher. His defense lawyer, Casey Coleman, said his father “made significant contributions to the U.S. government in Afghanistan.”

It’s possible that he was targeted because of the felony charge, despite it being dropped by an agreement with prosecutors. A spokesperson for ICE did not return a request for comment Monday morning regarding Momand’s arrest.

In 2009, Congress authorized resettlement programs for Afghans and Iraqis affected by America’s long-running wars in those countries. Since then, around 50,000 visas have been granted to Afghans who were employed by the U.S. government, according to the State Department. Another group of refugees was welcomed in after the U.S. exit from Kabul in 2021.

The Biden administration said many of the more recent admissions “took significant risks to support our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan.”

The Department of Homeland Security at the time said all visa recipients were rigorously vetted — thousands of applicants to the program continue to be denied each year, according to statistics from the Department of State.

Airington-Fisher, an immigration attorney of 17 years, said Special Immigrant Visas are reserved for the “most meritorious cases.” She described her client’s arrest as a clumsy waste of government resources.”

His family was scheduled for a formal green card interview this week, she said.

“They can say a million times that they are arresting the worst of the worst, that they are MS-13, that they are gang members, but that’s just not who they’re arresting,” said Airington-Fisher. “They’re arresting people like Arman, whose family filed all the proper paperwork.”

On Monday, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin sent CBS 21 the following statement about the woman's detention:

ICE arrested Estrelita Soliman-Ramos, a criminal illegal alien from the Philippines, on August 4, 2025. Her criminal history includes two arrests for theft. “On July 28, 2025, she was pulled over by local police for driving without a license and improperly restraining a child. On August 4, she reported to York ERO, and she was taken into custody.

While McLaughlin stated that Soliman had initially been in the country legally, that status had not been the case for over two decades:

She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000. Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.

A GoFundMe created on behalf of the family, which had raised over $81,000 as of Monday morning, said Soliman began her green card process last year.

As she worked through the process, the woman received a notice from ICE asking her to appear and register for an ""Alternatives to Detention"" program on Aug. 4.

The annual field trip had a different tone this year, however, as immigration enforcement raids have swept their communities.
Against this backdrop, choosing an issue to tackle as they sat at the wooden City Council desk was easy.
“We see the pain in the kids.” The conversations the younger kids are having aren’t too different from those of the older ones, Gallegos said.
“You guys have power,” Gallegos reminded the group as the youthful city council prepared to cast their mock vote calling for community mental health services.","The scene at the dais in Riverside’s City Council chambers looked a bit different on a recent Monday morning: Instead of men and women in business attire, children wearing navy blue T-shirts emblazoned with vibrant orange and yellow butterfly wings occupied the swivel chairs.

The children were participating in a mock council meeting as part of a summer leadership program run by TODEC, a legal center serving immigrants and farmworkers in the Inland Empire and Coachella Valley. The organization brought kids from across Coachella Valley and nearby cities to the Riverside City Council to give them hands-on learning experience on civic engagement and culture.

The annual field trip had a different tone this year, however, as immigration enforcement raids have swept their communities. Since June, the children have witnessed friends self-deport with their families, learned a local youth soccer coach was detained and have seen their own undocumented family members change daily routines in fear.

Against this backdrop, choosing an issue to tackle as they sat at the wooden City Council desk was easy. For the group of 22 children, ages 4 to 17, curbing fear over the unfolding raids and ongoing family separations was front and center.

“When people are going through stuff like that they get emotional and they get sad,” explained incoming fifth-grader Montserrat Garcia, leaning into the microphone as she assumed the role of mayor.

After a bit of discussion and guidance from Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson and TODEC executive director Luz Gallegos, the mock city council unanimously voted to fund mental health workshops for their community.

“They are learning the building blocks. They are being the change that needs to be seen,” said chaperone Julio Roman, dad to a 6- and 9-year-old on the trip. “If you read about it, you hear about it in books, it’s nothing like being here and having the privilege of coming in and actually seeing how the process works.”

Using civic knowledge to push for change

That’s been the intention of Monarcas Luchadoras, which translates to monarchs in the struggle. The program aims to equip school-age children, many of whom are immigrants or come from immigrant families, with an understanding of how to enact change. They’ve learned how laws are passed as well as how to recognize problems in their community and push for solutions through organizing.

Though the mission hasn’t wavered over the program’s nearly four decades, it has felt especially important this summer, she said — especially as kids are confronted with very real fears over separation.

“It’s a very different program to other summers,” said Gallegos, who is an alumna of the program. “We see the pain in the kids.”

The conversations the younger kids are having aren’t too different from those of the older ones, Gallegos said. They have all wanted to know why events are unfolding and how they align with American values.

“We are seeing kids as young as 4 years old knowing what ICE is, knowing that they may be undocumented, knowing that their parents and family and friends are undocumented,” she said.

The students took advantage of a rare field trip and explored art installations at The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art & Culture and learned about the historical figures whose statues make up the city’s Civil Rights Walk.

At the museum, a few kids lingered in front of a painting of a low rider, while others ran toward an installation with glass seashells typically used to call out to gods such as the Aztec goddess Cihuateotl, who was depicted at the installation.

“They’re teaching me how to keep up our culture, how to help other people, not just ourselves, how to be nice and kind, how to be respectful,” fifth-grader Garcia said.

Stepping up for Riverside’s immigrant community

The children have learned a lot just by being in the environment, said Linda Cruz, whose three children soaked in the new experiences, including her 3-year-old daughter Mia, who joins the group at events like Monday’s field trip.

Her children have also helped TODEC pack groceries and educational materials for families too scared to leave their homes.

“They’re seeing the anxiety, and they’re also seeing that, with that anxiety, they can do something,” Cruz said. “It’s giving them confidence that I think a lot of people in our community lack.”

Gallegos and other TODEC leaders have pushed kids to think about solutions even if they’re not old enough to vote. The center has also taken children to Sacramento, Moreno Valley and Riverside County to speak on how immigration enforcement has affected their friends and families.

And they’ve encouraged kids to share their own ideas as they learn to use their voices. Zoey Roman, 9, wants to find more ways to help families pay for groceries as parents stay home from work because of the raids.

If you haven't yet, you may want to read Part 1 (or listen), Part 2, Part 3, or Part 4 before diving into this analysis.

The Deportation Data Project released new figures yesterday covering ICE enforcement activities through the end of July, obtained through their ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This data provides an updated picture of immigration enforcement trends that builds on previous analysis of ICE arrest patterns.

The latest data shows that overall arrest numbers decreased between June and July, marking a notable month-to-month decline. However, these figures remain elevated when viewed against recent historical context, indicating that immigration enforcement continues at levels significantly higher than previous periods.

ICE's daily arrest numbers also tell an important story about enforcement capacity and policy. Despite previous reports of a 3,000-per-day arrest quota, daily figures have consistently fallen short of reaching this threshold, with no significant increase in recent daily totals.

This discrepancy becomes more convoluted when considering recent court filings from the Department of Justice that have challenged the existence of such a policy altogether, contradicting earlier public statements and media reports that supported the existence of these daily quotas.

I’ll leave it to the lawyers to decide whether the administration’s touting of a daily goal of 3,000 arrests does or does not constitute a quota. It seems that, once again, the administration likes to say one thing in public, then something different in official filings—reminiscent of Trump’s debunked allegations that the election was stolen. In any case, regardless of whether 3,000 daily arrests was a “goal” or a “quota”, the administration is not meeting it. The data makes that clear.

Perhaps the most significant finding from previous analysis continues to hold true in the July data: the demographic composition of ICE arrests remains skewed toward individuals with no criminal history. The surge in arrests that peaked at the end of May and continued through mid-June was primarily driven by enforcement actions against immigrants without criminal backgrounds.

While this number retreated from its previous high by the end of June and maintained lower levels throughout July, immigrants with no criminal history still represent the largest single category of ICE arrests through the end of July. Remarkably, this group continues to exceed the number of arrests involving immigrants with criminal convictions—a pattern that raises important questions about enforcement priorities and resource allocation.

These trends in ICE enforcement data reveal the ongoing tension between stated policy objectives and actual implementation on the ground. As the Deportation Data Project continues to extract information through litigation, these updates provide crucial transparency into immigration enforcement patterns that might otherwise remain hidden from public scrutiny.

The persistence of high arrest numbers, combined with the continued focus on individuals without criminal histories, suggests that current enforcement practices remain at odds with stated priorities of focusing resources on those who pose genuine public safety concerns. As new data becomes available, tracking these patterns will be essential for understanding the real-world impact of immigration enforcement policies.

But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp benefits.
Those who may lose SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, the CBO estimates.
But the Food Research & Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the food police and start investing in real solutions”.
“That means increasing Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.","Republican-led cuts to public assistance programs – carried out at the behest of Donald Trump’s administration – will lead to 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps, among them families with children, the non-partisan congressional budget office (CBO) has found.

The estimate, published Monday, forecast that the number of people receiving food stamp benefits in an average month would drop after Republican lawmakers expanded work requirements to some parents, older enrollees and others.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), formerly known as food stamps, in 2024 served an average of 41.7 million people monthly, or 12.3% of the US population. Federal spending on the program amounts to almost $100bn, and benefits average $187.20 a month.

But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp benefits. The Snap program has long required certain able-bodied adults to work to receive benefits for longer than three months.

But the bill broadened the requirement to parents of dependent children – requiring that those with kids ages 14 and older work, volunteer or participate in job training at least 80 hours monthly.

The bill – which places more responsibility for food programs and other benefits onto states – requires that adults ages 55 to 64, veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster care youth meet the mandate, though it exempts Native Americans, according to CNN.

The CBO estimates that US households, on average, will see an increase in the resources available to them as a result of the bill – but “the changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households”.

Those who may lose SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, the CBO estimates.

The agency said it “estimates that, in general, resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution”.

But the highest earners, with incomes of nearly $700,000, on average, will see a $13,600 jump in their incomes, or about 2.7%.

Overall, middle-income Americans, who earn about $86,000 on average, will get an $800 increase in federal assistance overall while those who earn less than $24,000 will see their projected incomes drop by about $1,200 a year.

The estimates come as the federal government is shifting costs of benefit programs onto states.

“Hunger is a public health crisis, and Snap is one of the most effective tools we have to address it – reducing food insecurity, improving health outcomes, and lowering long-term health care costs,” the Food Research & Action Center said recently, after the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) moved to restrict certain junk foods, including sodas and candy, from products that can be purchased with Snap benefits.

“For years, Snap has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy – products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said in a statement.

But the Food Research & Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the food police and start investing in real solutions”.

“That means increasing Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f826e74a361b72e6ca893bb7fc51dfa8514b49/728_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8598e8381f8da165e8b00c33e687bfe2",N,,2025-08-12 12:58:29.179277

LaMonica McIver said she will continue to fight for congressional oversight of immigration detention centers, despite facing federal charges accusing her of assaulting officers during a May visit to a migrant jail in Newark.

McIver (D-10) told the New Jersey Monitor at an event in Jersey City Monday that the case against her has been “definitely stressful.”

“When you talk about a person coming to charge you because you were there to do your job and they’re telling you you can get 17 years in prison, that’s nothing to joke with. I’m a mother, I’m a wife, I have a family,” she said.

McIver was joined by Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City for what they billed as a dialogue series to discuss their “shared experiences and work fighting for our communities in the time of Trump.”

The two recalled an immigration raid in Newark that occurred less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump took office for his second term, along with their often confrontational visits to detention centers.

McIver, Menendez, and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) showed up at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed migrant detention center in Newark, on May 9 for an unannounced inspection of the facility. Their visit ended in chaos, with federal officers arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and charging him with trespassing, then later charging McIver and accusing her of shoving agents as they took Baraka into custody. She pleaded not guilty, and her trial is tentatively set to begin in November (the charges against Baraka were quickly dropped).

Menendez recalled from his visit to Delaney Hall that the building was dirty, the telephones were not working, and the three members of Congress got stuck in an elevator. Baraka and other Newark officials have accused Delaney Hall’s owners, private prison firm Geo Group, of opening the facility without proper city permits and inspections.

McIver noted on Monday that after the incident at Delaney Hall made national headlines, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to stop members of Congress from making unannounced visits to immigrant detention centers by requiring them to alert the department seven days in advance. An appropriations law in effect since 2019 grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“It hasn’t changed — it’s just that the administration wants it to change, so they literally put out a guidance, but you can’t just change policy because you want to,” McIver said. “That’s not how it works.”

Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too.

Dr. David Himmelstein, HUNTER COLLEGE: There are already huge numbers of vacancies for nursing home workers and for home care workers.
Job losses would include health care workers, but also support positions like maintenance staff and housekeepers like Vanessa Joseph.","Amna Nawaz:

More than a million immigrants work in health care in the U.S., and they make up an increasing share of caregivers for elderly and disabled Americans. That includes medical professionals, but also the housekeepers and the janitors that keep nursing homes running. These facilities already face labor shortages.

And now, as William Brangham reports, the Trump administration's immigration policies could make it even more difficult to find workers.

William Brangham:

She fled her native Haiti and settled in Florida. After the devastating 2010 earthquake, the Obama administration granted her and thousands of other Haitians temporary protected status, or TPS, which allowed them to remain in the United States and work legally, but didn't provide a path to permanent residency.

As TPS for Haitians was repeatedly extended, Edelyne got married, bought this house. She also had a daughter, who is 6 and is an American citizen. She enrolled in school, working first as a nursing assistant, and then as a registered nurse in nursing homes.

Edelyne Jean:

I love what I'm doing, and I do it with pride and the compassion. Like, I feel for these people. Like, some of them, they have no family members. We are the family. We are family.

Edelyne Jean:

I tried. Like, I do the right thing. I tried to be one of them, to be part of America. But I don't think we're welcome, I'm welcome, especially with this administration. No.

William Brangham:

In February, even as armed gangs expanded control over parts of Haiti, the Trump administration sought to end TPS for Haitians and send them back.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: They're pouring into our country, pouring in. If I weren't elected president, there'd be nobody in Haiti anymore.

William Brangham:

The move was just one of several efforts to rescind the status of thousands of noncitizens working legally across the United States.

Is this something you're worrying about every single day?

William Brangham:

Haitians on TPS were granted a reprieve last month when a federal district court judge ruled that the deadline for ending TPS must be extended to next February. But that's little comfort for Edelyne and her family.

Edelyne Jean:

If nothing happens, I'm screwed, because, if I can't work to take out the bills, I won't be able to take out my daughter. And I don't know. I can't even think about it.

William Brangham:

The looming end of TPS is not just a crisis for Edelyne and the hundreds of thousands of other Haitians here in the U.S.

It's also putting extraordinary strain on long-term health care facilities, like nursing homes, where a little over 7 percent of the work force are noncitizens.

Dr. David Himmelstein, HUNTER COLLEGE:

There are already huge numbers of vacancies for nursing home workers and for home care workers. And if the immigrants who are now filling those jobs go away, they just won't be filled is almost certainly what's going to happen.

Dr. David Himmelstein:

Hospitals and emergency rooms to panned on nursing homes. They can't discharge patients who are not able to care for themselves unless there's a nursing home to take care of them or home care workers to take care of them. And that's going to mean backups.

William Brangham:

At the Sinai Residences in Boca Raton, Florida, these policy changes could mean dozens of workers might lose their jobs. This facility includes independent and assisted living, a nursing home and a memory care unit.

Job losses would include health care workers, but also support positions like maintenance staff and housekeepers like Vanessa Joseph. She came to the U.S. from Haiti two years ago with a younger sister and her teenage son. She's legally working under TPS.

Vanessa Joseph, TPS Recipient:

I cry every day. But I don't tell my son that because he can have more — more stress than me. So I tell him it's going to be OK. So I just stay positive.

Rachel Blumberg:

There were a lot of questions of, what have I done wrong? And my answer to them was that, you have done absolutely nothing wrong. It's unfortunately just where you were born, which doesn't seem fair at all. It was, I would have to say, the hardest day of my entire 30-year career in senior living.

William Brangham:

Blumberg says losing these workers would not only be hard on their own lives, but on the many residents at Sinai who've developed long and deep relationships with them; 92-year-old Isobel Loring has lived at Sinai for almost a decade, and she's grown very close to Vanessa.

Isobel Loring:

I love you too.

The people I care about are the people that are working with us, that are helping us, that are here for us when we need them under all circumstances. If these people are not being allowed to work, there won't be people to take care of us. These communities that have elderly people, there are no Americans that really want to do those jobs.

Vanessa Joseph:

I like work here. We are family here. But it's so hard, hard, hard to go back in Haiti. I can't. Sometimes, I would like to see my mom, hug her because she's sick, but I can't.

Rachel Blumberg:

We're already looking at, unfortunately, replacing them. It's not what I want to do, but we're a 24/7 operation. We have to have our caregivers and our essential workers there.

William Brangham:

The Trump administration is still determining next steps in the court case that delayed the end of TPS to early next year.

In a recent statement, the Department of Homeland Security said: ""President Trump and Secretary Noem are restoring common sense to our immigration system and returning TPS to its original status, temporary.""

William Brangham:

Back outside Orlando, nurse Edelyne Jean is bracing for the next shoe to drop.

If it comes down to the government saying you have to leave, will you go back to Haiti or will you try to go somewhere else?

Edelyne Jean:

I don't see myself going back to Haiti, because, if I go, they will kill you. Eventually, they will. So I'm not going. And I have my daughter too. She was born here. She belongs here.

William Brangham:

With federal immigration policy changing almost daily, Edelyne is left worried that the life she has built in America could soon come to an end.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

""We're getting them out at record numbers,"" Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. ""We have an obligation to, and we're doing it.""

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it's not just the big bill's fresh infusion of funds fueling the president's agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

""Your agency is out of control,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would ""go broke"" by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an ""indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,"" often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump's long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

""We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,"" the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

""We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department's plan to disburse OBBBA funding,"" they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee ""to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated"" through the new law.

""ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,"" she said. ""This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.""

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it's what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a ""whole of government"" approach.

""They're orienting this huge shift,"" Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves ""inward.""

The flood of cash comes when Americans' views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a ""good thing"" for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump's approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new ""Speedway Slammer"" in Indiana.

The proposal was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review three weeks ago.

Though details are confidential until publication in the Federal Register, the proposed rule could seek to supplement or replace the annual H-1B cap lottery by giving priority in the selection process to registrants who meet or exceed certain criteria, such as wage or education level.

During the final weeks of the first Trump Administration, an alteration to the cap selection process was finalized by DHS that would have largely replaced the computerized H-1B lottery with a system that allocated H-1B visa numbers according to the Department of Labor’s four-level prevailing wage system. That regulation would have first distributed H-1B cap numbers to registrants offered a wage that equaled or exceeded Level IV, the highest wage tier of the prevailing wage system, then would have selected registrations in descending order from Wage Levels III, II, and I; a computerized lottery would have been used only if the number of registrations for a specific wage level exceeded the number of H-1B cap slots available. The final rule was postponed in the first days of the Biden Administration and ultimately vacated by a federal court without having been implemented.

It is not yet known whether the proposal now under review is the same as the rule finalized in early 2021.

It is expected that the proposed regulation will be released for publication in the Federal Register in the coming days or weeks, with a public comment period of 30 or 60 days. After giving meaningful consideration to the comments, the agency would then publish a final version of the rule with an implementation period.

From the detention facilities that private-prison firm GEO Group owns or leases, revenue for the second quarter this year jumped 12% from last year, driven largely by new contracts at facilities like Delaney Hall in Newark.

Executives at GEO Group and CoreCivic said they were open to operating on military sites.
“There are billions going to immigration facilities,” Linhorst said.","WASHINGTON — Government contracts fueled a financial boom this year for the two private prison companies that dominate the U.S. immigration detention industry.

The industry stands to gain further as the Trump administration expands the network of privately run detention sites nationally, targeting a goal of deporting 1 million immigrants this year.

From the detention facilities that private-prison firm GEO Group owns or leases, revenue for the second quarter this year jumped 12% from last year, driven largely by new contracts at facilities like Delaney Hall in Newark.

“Congrats again on the quarter and the fantastic growth opportunities ahead of us,” Joe Gomes, a financial analyst with Noble Capital Markets, told GEO Group executives on an earnings call last week.

Big rewards

Revenue for CoreCivic, the other major company in the nation’s corporate prison industry, rose about 10% over the same period, the company said. CoreCivic operates the Elizabeth Detention Center.

“Our business is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment,” said Damon Hininger, CEO of CoreCivic, who praised a recent federal court ruling that cleared a path for new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities in New Jersey. “We strongly believe that this was the right decision,” he said.

Early in the second Trump administration, the private prison industry is riding a lucrative wave of government contracts and eyeing steps to grow further. Those plans include opening mothballed facilities, using GPS tracking devices to monitor undocumented immigrants and expanding air- and ground-based transportation of detainees.

The private operators are also looking to profit by expanding their reach by using military sites to hold detainees. Executives at GEO Group and CoreCivic said they were open to operating on military sites.

George Zoley, executive chairman of the GEO Group, said his company had reached agreements with a military contractor so that GEO could “pursue potential procurements that may be issued for operational support services at military sites.”

NJ military site

The U.S. government plans to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst for deportation flights and to hold between 1,000 and 3,000 undocumented immigrants there, according to plans NJ Spotlight News first reported.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has also publicly approved Camp Atterbury in Indiana and the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold undocumented immigrants.

‘The fact that there are new beds opening up today does not mean that they’re going to close when Trump leaves office’ — Molly Linhorst, attorney, ACLU of New Jersey

Lifting this financially lucrative wave for private prison firms is the roughly $170 billion in federal funding Congress allocated for the Trump administration, through a recently enacted law, to use on its hardline immigration agenda.

“I think it is an unprecedented opportunity for them,” Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney at the ACLU of New Jersey, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.

“There are billions going to immigration facilities,” Linhorst said. “The private prison companies are by no means strangers to the federal government.”

Billions to be spent

Both companies lobbied Congress on legislation that turned into the law that contained the approximately $170 billion portion of new funding, federal lobbying records show.

Zoley, of GEO Group, said the Delaney Hall site “remains in the process of ramping up,” describing its opening in February as an “important milestone.”

Delaney Hall, which can hold 1,000 detainees, is expected to make the company more than $60 million over its first year running, Zoley said.

The GEO Group has contracts to run 21 detention facilities nationwide, and the number of beds in its control — industry shorthand for how many people can be detained — grew from 15,000 to 20,000 from April through June this year. “This represents more than one-third of the current ICE detention levels, which we estimate to be approximately 57,000 beds nationwide,” Zoley said, adding that the company “stocked up the inventory of our monitoring devices” used to track immigrants who are not detained but after “ICE detention capacity” runs out.

The Trump administration has a goal of reaching 100,000 beds for ICE by the end of the year, an objective that could be met with the use of outdoor tents and military sites, like the joint base in New Jersey.

Whatever immigration detention apparatus is erected during the second Trump term will linger beyond, Linhorst predicted, noting the 15-year contract the U.S. government reached with GEO Group to run Delaney Hall.

“The fact that there are new beds opening up today does not mean that they’re going to close when Trump leaves office,” Linhorst said.

“Right now, it’s a huge moment,” Linhorst added. Yet what decisions the U.S. government reaches with the industry will carry on, she said. “There’s a lot of motive to continue to fill these beds.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/08/ICE-federal-agents-Delaney-Hall-ICE-protest.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 01:56:21.438391

Everett woman and son detained by ICE

Shaw is a New Zealand national who is in the process of applying for lawful permanent residency. Shaw currently holds a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that provides work authorization and advance parole, allowing international travel and re-entry.

Shaw’s work authorization was approved, although the advance parole was not. She immigrated to the U.S. three and a half years ago under sponsorship from her former husband, and qualified to reapply independently as a survivor of domestic abuse.

“I thought we had crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I,’” Besancon said. “Sarah had been waiting on some travel documents to be approved. But once her visa and her children’s visas were cleared, she felt comfortable taking them to Canada. We assumed everything was fine.”

Shaw currently works for the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families at the Echo Glen Children’s Center, a juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie. Shaw is also a member of Union Local 341.

Everett mother being held at Texas immigration center

Shaw is currently being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center, which is one of two facilities in the nation that house detained families facing deportation.

Shaw’s attorney, Minda Thorward, said she is eligible for a green card, and noted that in years prior, Shaw would have been released quickly. However, Thorward claimed that “anything’s possible” under the current presidential administration.

“With everything this administration has done, they’ve chosen cruelty intentionally — over and over,” Thorward said, according to KING 5.

“I know you don’t want to be detained,” Grande told the man.
Accompanied by faith: Local faith leaders began showing up to immigration court daily this month to accompany people in response to ICE’s decision to arrest many after their hearings, Alexandra Mendoza reported for The San Diego-Union Tribune.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains more and more people, courtrooms at Otay Mesa Detention Center have filled, leaving many family and friends hoping to see their loved ones’ hearings stuck instead in the facility lobby.

In June when I went to the detention center to watch a bond hearing for a man arrested at the downtown San Diego Immigration Court and detained at Otay Mesa, the line of members of the public trying to get into the court stretched almost to the lobby door. The guards working the front desk warned that we might not get in because of limited seating.

I watched as a family of nine had to choose which members to send up to the courtroom. Several community members were in line behind me to see the same case I was there to watch. I was the only one of us allowed up, and the processing took so long that even though we arrived at the facility well before the afternoon hearings began, I missed most of his hearing by the time I got upstairs to the court.

Guards escorted attorneys and members of the public to the courtrooms through a series of sliding metal doors controlled by badges.

It wasn’t the first time that I’d seen people denied entrance to the courtrooms due to space constraints. Each courtroom has rows of three benches on each side of the door. According to the guards, people in custody are not allowed to sit next to people not in custody, unless they are attorneys. That means if there is a detained person sitting on a bench, no member of the public can sit there.

The guards also don’t allow men in custody to sit on the same bench as women in custody, or men wearing blue, indicating ICE considers them low security level, to sit next to men wearing red, those ICE considers high security. Men in orange, people ICE has labeled medium level security, are usually grouped with those in red.

In July, I sat in the packed courtroom of Immigration Judge Guy Grande at Otay Mesa Detention Center, watching as person after person asked to be deported.

More than a dozen men squeezed into the three benches to the left of the door. The men in the first row wore orange, and those in the second two rows, which had five people crammed into each of them, wore blue. On the right, a row of women wearing either blue or orange filled the front bench. I sat with a couple of family members of one of the men in the second bench, and several more detained men sat in the bench behind us, including a man in red.

The man spoke with his son, a toddler in the row I was sitting in, and a guard moved him further away from the child so they wouldn’t speak.

Grande worked his way through the cases, including a few detained men that were held in San Luis Regional Detention Center in Arizona who appeared on a television screen along with the judge, who was using Webex from his courtroom in downtown San Diego to hear the cases.

As the afternoon stretched past 4 p.m., the time that immigration courts typically close, Grande called forward a man from Mexico who asked for voluntary departure.

The judge swore the man in and began reading through ICE’s allegations and charge. (Though immigration is considered a civil legal matter rather than a criminal one, people in immigration court do face charges that indicate why ICE thinks they are deportable.)

When the judge asked to confirm his nationality, the man said he was from Tijuana.

Grande told the man that ICE said he had overstayed his visa, that he had entered in October 2015 with a tourist visa.

The man corrected the judge. The last time he entered was in June 2025, less than two weeks before, he said.

“In 2025?” the judge said.

Yes, the man said.

He told the judge he’d been in the United States for about three days doing some shopping when ICE arrested him.

The judge turned to the ICE attorney in the courtroom and confirmed that normally someone can stay up to six months on that kind of tourist visa.

The judge looked at the date on the Notice to Appear, the document containing the allegations and charge that the Department of Homeland Security files with the court to start an immigration case. It was just a few days after the man said he’d entered the United States.

The ICE attorney asked for a continuance, saying she needed time to find the man’s arrest documents.

“I know you don’t want to be detained,” Grande told the man. “I wouldn’t want to be detained either.”

“The government doesn’t have the file, and it’s late in the day,” Grande added. “You could be in status. Maybe the government can’t sustain the charge.”

The man asked, with some disbelief in his voice, if the judge was suggesting he wait more time in custody to try to sort out the issue.

After more back and forth, Grande asked the man if he wanted the judge to terminate his case.

The man said he didn’t know what that meant.

The judge said he didn’t think based on the information in the Notice to Appear that he could order the man removed.

“I don’t want to be detained anymore,” the man said. “My family depends on me. I work in Tijuana to provide for my family.”

Over ICE’s objections, Grande terminated the case. When I checked for the man in ICE’s detainee database about a week later, he was no longer in custody.

Around 5:30 p.m., Grande still had several people in his courtroom waiting to ask to be deported.

“I am burned out,” Grande said. “This is beyond my pay grade.”

He told his clerk to set the remaining cases over for the following morning.

“We started to reach out to all the states that have legislation concerning masked ICE agents and said, ‘Let’s do this jointly.
Soon, Fonseca Tapia said, realized that he was being followed in a vehicle by the man in the construction worker get-up.
After Fonseca Tapia stopped filming, he said that the masked agent issued a warning: “More of my guys are coming and we’re going to take care of you.” To Fonseca Tapia, that sounded like an act of intimidation.
ICE failed to answer The Intercept’s questions about the use of disguises by ICE agents and if the agent who failed to identify himself in Brewster had been reprimanded.","Despite their proclivity for wearing masks, the Department of Homeland Security denies that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents refuse to identify themselves in the field. “I’ve been on a number of these operations,” Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said last month. “They are wearing vests that say ICE or ERO, which is the enforcement arm of ICE or Homeland Security Investigations. They clearly verbally identify themselves.”

But video from a confrontation in a New York state town that was reviewed by The Intercept contradicts her claims.

In the footage, Juan Fonseca Tapia, the co-founder and organizer of the Connecticut-based immigrant advocacy group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, questions a man dressed as a construction worker.

“What agency are you with?” asks Fonseca Tapia, filming through his car window.

“I’m not going to tell you,” responds the man, who is wearing a high-visibility construction vest, an orange helmet, and glasses, with a camouflage mask covering most of his face. “It’s none of your business.”

The construction worker getup was actually a disguise: ICE confirmed to The Intercept that the man in the hard hat is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. “ICE New York City officers were conducting surveillance in Brewster, New York, August 2, when anti-ICE agitators followed them and attempted to disrupt their operation,” an ICE spokesperson told The Intercept by email.

In the video — which was posted last weekend on social media by Greater Danbury Area Unites for Immigrants — the ICE agent said only that he is a member of “federal law enforcement.” Neither “ICE” nor “ERO” is visible on his vest in the footage.

That puts the lie to McLaughlin’s claims that ICE agents identify themselves.

Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept that he spotted a second man who was similarly disguised as a construction worker.

“I find it outrageous. It’s indefensible. This is where we are crossing a dangerous line on immigration enforcement into these paramilitary type tactics with a secret police force,” said New York state Sen. Patricia Fahy who last month introduced the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics, or MELT, Act, which would ban the use of face coverings and plainclothes by ICE and other federal enforcement agents during civilian immigration actions conducted in New York. “The first three words of the provision that we’re adding into law are ‘Masks and disguises prohibited,’ period. And this video is Exhibit A. This is exactly what we are alarmed about.”

On Tuesday, at a National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, Fahy joined colleagues from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in condemning the use of “paramilitary-type secret police” tactics by ICE agents. “We started to reach out to all the states that have legislation concerning masked ICE agents and said, ‘Let’s do this jointly. Let’s collectively bring attention to this,’” Fahy told The Intercept. “We had a couple of dozen lawmakers all standing up to say ‘This is not who we are’ and calling out these authoritarian-type tactics.”

The interaction with the disguised construction worker began when Fonseca Tapia spotted a group of people he believed to be ICE agents in downtown Brewster. He began alerting day laborers who congregate in the area, while driving in his car. Soon, Fonseca Tapia said, realized that he was being followed in a vehicle by the man in the construction worker get-up. Eventually, he found himself surrounded by several vehicles with dark tinted windows.

Fonseca Tapia said that the man in the construction worker disguise confronted him and repeatedly tried to persuade him to roll down his window or get out of the car. He said he feared that he might be “kidnapped” by ICE.

After Fonseca Tapia stopped filming, he said that the masked agent issued a warning: “More of my guys are coming and we’re going to take care of you.”

To Fonseca Tapia, that sounded like an act of intimidation.

“It’s literally a threat,” said Fonseca Tapia. “You have three vehicles with very tinted windows, so it’s impossible to see inside. People are wearing masks and refuse to identify themselves, and one of them tells you he is going to call more of them to ‘take care of you’?” This is for sure an intimidation tactic to instill fear in people who are working to alert the community when there is an ICE presence.”

An ICE spokesperson cited “increased assaults toward ICE” as the reason that the ICE agent confronted individuals who followed and filmed them in Brewster. “The officer was concerned for the safety of himself and others,” the spokesperson wrote.

“I don’t know what the concern was — because he was following me,” said Fonseca Tapia. “If he thought I posed a threat, I don’t think he would put himself in danger by following me.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, masked ICE agents carrying out immigration raids have become increasingly common. Across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies working with ICE launch operations wearing disguises or plainclothes and sometimes arrive in unmarked vehicles and arrest people without warrants. Often ICE agents don masks, balaclavas, neck gaiters, or other facial coverings to conceal their identities.

Lawmakers, veteran law enforcement officials, activists, and citizens have criticized the donning of masks by law enforcement as anti-American — for sowing confusion, chaos, and fear, while reducing accountability and undermining public trust.

“The failure of ICE officers and agents to promptly and clearly identify who they are and the authority under which they are acting has led witnesses of immigration enforcement operations to justifiably question the law enforcement status, authority, and constitutionality of ICE officers and agents and their operations,” wrote U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a May letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; Tom Homan, the executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations; and top ICE officials. “We remain deeply concerned that ICE’s lack of transparency will lead the public to intercede in enforcement efforts, escalating an already tense interaction, and risking an entirely avoidable violent situation.”

Fahy emphasized that she had a family member who served in law enforcement and that she saw the use of masks and disguises as a threat to law and order. “It’s undermining all of law enforcement because they come across as impersonators. There’s no accountability and there’s no transparency, so it erodes public trust and undermines decades of work and millions of dollars spent,” she told The Intercept. “When they use disguises, these arrests — without presenting an arrest warrant, neither a judicial or even administrative warrant — come across as abductions or kidnapping. These are third-world tactics, and they should shock the collective conscience.”

The International Association of Chiefs of Police warns that “members of the general public may be intimidated or fearful of officers wearing a face covering, which may heighten their defensive reactions.”

An ICE spokesperson said the agency has no policy on masks, aside from pandemic safety requirements. The Department of Homeland Security has endorsed the agents’ right to wear masks, citing attacks on agents or the doxing of law enforcement or their families. In an email, DHS specifically mentioned one Texas man’s threat to shoot ICE agents as a reason to allow masks, although it was unclear how a mask would protect an agent from a bullet. Nonetheless, DHS insisted that because of such fears, ICE would not discourage its agents from wearing masks during anti-immigrant raids.

For almost two months, DHS has failed to respond to The Intercept’s questions about escalating statistics quoted by government officials about supposed assaults of federal agents. In June, DHS told The Intercept that “ICE law enforcement and their families are being targeted and are facing an over 400% increase in assaults.” ICE now claims that figure has jumped to 830 percent.

ICE failed to answer The Intercept’s questions about the use of disguises by ICE agents and if the agent who failed to identify himself in Brewster had been reprimanded. “At no time did the officer attempt to make an arrest or detain anyone without being plainly marked as an ICE officer,” the spokesperson said.

The New York City Bar Association has noted that secret police tactics are a gateway to further lawlessness. “Allowing masked ICE agents to conduct detentions also makes it increasingly likely that third-party actors will impersonate federal agents and use their anonymity to subject vulnerable populations to harassment and violence under the apparent color of law,” the group said in a June statement.

Bad actors have, indeed, masqueraded as ICE agents from coast to coast this year. Various people have reportedly impersonated ICE agents to commit or attempt robbery in Pennsylvania, kidnapping in Florida and South Carolina, scams in California, sexual assault in North Carolina, rape in New York, as well as acts of impersonation, intimidation and other offenses in California, Florida, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Washington state.

In Congress, Democrats have introduced several bills, including the No Secret Police Act, which would bar federal agents from concealing their faces with “home-made, non-tactical masks” and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting people.

“If you uphold the peace of a democratic society, you should not be anonymous,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “DHS and ICE agents wearing masks and hiding identification echoes the tactics of secret police authoritarian regimes — and deviates from the practices of local law enforcement, which contributes to confusion in communities.”

An ICE spokesperson claimed the persons filming the agent in Brewster presented “a safety concern for the officers, the community and even the agitators themselves” and that the “ICE officer contacted the local police.”

The Village of Brewster Police Department, however, told The Intercept that it did not take part in any such interaction. The Putnam County Sheriff’s Office refused to entertain The Intercept’s questions. “We don’t have somebody that would handle even communicating that to the press if it was even for the press’s knowledge,” said a person who replied to a request for her name with “No, thank you,” before hanging up. A message left for the department’s civil affairs division was not returned.

Fonseca Tapia said that personnel from both the Brewster Police Department and the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office were called to the scene and spoke with him.

“This is a call to action for people to understand that this is wrong and this is not normal. Nobody is coming to save us. We are all we got,” Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept. “Now is the time for action. People need to get involved because today it’s immigrants’ rights, but who knows what group it’s going to be tomorrow?”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-agent-disguise-e1754926711311.jpg?fit=1064%2C530&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-12 01:57:03.578276

Cornyn tours ICE facility at Fort Bliss, backs Trump-era immigration policies - El Paso Times",Kristian Jaime,,,,,https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/immigration/2025/08/11/sen-john-cornyn-visits-ice-detention-center-on-fort-bliss/85618284007/,"Ultimately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility.
ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility.
Oversight concerns and ICE facilities Cornyn underscored the need for congressional oversight of such locations, alluding to the current lawsuit by a number of democrats against the Trump administration.
Calling them ""humane and safe"" facilities, Cornyn noted some will be detained for as little as two weeks before being repatriated.
For others, they will be sent there to address overcrowding at other ICE facilities.","When Texas Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX, stopped in El Paso to visit the Camp East Montana migrant detention center on Fort Bliss, it was also to double down on national security rhetoric.

Cornyn's visit on Monday, Aug. 11, was only a ""windshield"" tour according to his office, but it also was an opportunity to echo much of the sentiment from the Trump administration on removing ""criminal aliens"" from the country.

""I call it the 'Lonestar Lockup' and it will hold up to 1,000 criminal aliens pending their repatriation to their countries of origin,"" Cornyn said. ""We're not talking about gardeners or housekeepers or people like that. We're talking about as many as 291,000 individuals that are illegal aliens with criminal charges pending or criminal convictions. They are also ones who have exhausted their legal remedies.""

The Trump administration plans to expand the facility by 250 beds each week until it reaches 1,000. Ultimately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility. That would make it the largest of its kind in the United States.

ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility. El Paso's ICE spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa said in a news statement that it will provide detainees with access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation and medical treatment, among other services, which detainees receive in other facilities.

""There's no due process issue involved here since these are people who didn't show up to their immigration hearing,"" Cornyn said. ""The judge issued an order of deportation, so they simply defied that and remained in the United States. Many people want to come to the United States, and there is a legal way to do that, and we honor and respect people who play by the rules.""

Cornyn aimed at the previous Biden administration for what he called ""open border policies"" that he claims did little to no vetting.

The Republican senator praised Trump's efforts to ""bring rule of law back,"" saying the nation needed a new president. He cited the lower number of immigrants crossing in areas like El Paso, which he attributed to the $175 billion allocated to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for building facilities like Camp East Montana.

When will the facility be open?

""The facility is not yet open and will open in about a week with about 1,000 individuals detained there. ICE confirmed they will be given a medical exam and categorized by risk levels based on criminal records. They will be repatriated or sent to other facilities from this location,"" Cornyn said.

Cornyn also noted that it will not house families or children. Citing that it meets federal or state standards, he also said it will have adequate food and cooling from the Texas heat.

He also noted it will be a permanent facility, complete with hard walls ""for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

Oversight concerns and ICE facilities

Cornyn underscored the need for congressional oversight of such locations, alluding to the current lawsuit by a number of democrats against the Trump administration.

""I think congressional oversight is important, but that requires members of Congress not to committ acts of violence or disobediance of the laws themselves,"" Cornyn said. ""We've seen some people try to crash these facilities that are secured. They must do their job and not have members of Congress or anyone else to interfere. Once this location is open, it'll be avaiable at scheduled times for oversight and to the media to show the American people what they actually are.""

Calling them ""humane and safe"" facilities, Cornyn noted some will be detained for as little as two weeks before being repatriated. For others, they will be sent there to address overcrowding at other ICE facilities.

The Henrico, Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics LLC company was awarded a $231,878,229 firm-fixed-price contract to establish and operate a detention facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The contract comes on the heels of Presidential Executive Order 14159, which outlines using ""national security assets for law and order.""

Among the criticisms of the contract by congressional Democrats was that the company had little experience building expansive projects such as Camp East Montana.

""That's the reason there needs to be appropriate congressional oversight and we'll have a chance to monitor the location once it opens,"" Cornyn said.

He concluded there will be other facilities of this type across the country, but not on the scale of one on Fort Bliss.

Sentencing is scheduled for October 16, 2025, before United States District Judge Angela M. Martinez.

In his plea, Espinoza admitted that for a period of time leading up to March 2024, he recruited human smuggling drivers and coordinated the transportation of illegal aliens from areas near the Mexico border to places further in the interior of the United States. Espinoza’s involvement in the conspiracy was for personal financial gain and led to at least 25 illegal aliens receiving transportation.

Espinoza also admitted that on March 6, 2024, he coordinated an event in which a driver and a front seat passenger picked up two illegal aliens near Lukeville, Arizona. At some point while they were being transported, the aliens were told to get out of the vehicle. The two aliens then jumped, fell, or were pushed from the vehicle while it was still moving. As a result, one of the aliens hit his head on the ground, suffered serious injury, and died at the hospital two days later.

A conviction for Conspiracy to Transport Illegal Aliens for Profit carries a maximum penalty of ten years of imprisonment and a maximum fine of $250,000,000.

The investigation of this case is the result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 405 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 350 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets

Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation in this case. The United States Attorney’s Office, District of Arizona, Tucson, is handling the prosecution.

After inspection by immigration officials, some were granted parole, which is a temporary permission to live in the U.S. legally.
“This sudden policy shift is the latest in the Trump-Vance administration’s assault on immigrants who have followed the rules.
“Ending parole status in this way is both unlawful and harmful to immigrant families by making them more vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation.
“ The plaintiffs are asking the court to reverse the termination of their parole and work authorization, restore their ability to stay, work, and apply for asylum or other immigration relief, and stop DHS from carrying out future mass arbitrary revocations of parole status.","Boston, MA – The Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts and three individuals from Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti filed suit today against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by Democracy Forward and Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, challenges the Trump-Vance administration’s sudden and unlawful termination of the plaintiff’s parole status, which allowed them to live and work legally in the United States.

Starting in 2023, non-citizens seeking asylum or other immigration relief in the United States were required to use the CBP One mobile application to schedule appointments at ports of entry. After inspection by immigration officials, some were granted parole, which is a temporary permission to live in the U.S. legally.

However, in April 2025, through a mass email that read, “It is time for you to leave the United States,” DHS notified hundreds of thousands of non-citizens that their parole status was terminated, and, as a result, their work authorizations and eligibility for certain benefits were also revoked. The email, sent to non-citizens with the right to remain legally present in the U.S., and in some cases, the U.S. citizens representing them, threatened penalties to encourage self-deportation.

The filing states that this unlawful policy violates federal law, which requires a case-by-case determination that the purpose of parole was served before it can be ended, ignores non-citizens’ legal rights and disrupts their lives, costing them jobs, homes, access to health care, and placing them at risk of deportation.

“As a community-based organization, we have seen firsthand the direct harm this sudden policy inflicts on people who arrived lawfully, complied with every DHS requirement, including the CBP One process, and worked hard to build stable lives for their families. Stripping them of parole and work authorization without any individualized review is not only unlawful, it destabilizes families, weakens our communities, and undermines the trust immigrants place in the legal system. Our commitment is to stand with them and fight to ensure their rights are protected. At VAM, we believe that protecting migrants is protecting the future of our community,” said Carlina Velázquez and Carlos Martín Medina, Board of Directors, Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts.

“This sudden policy shift is the latest in the Trump-Vance administration’s assault on immigrants who have followed the rules. Let me be clear: none of this is about immigration, it’s about cruelty and the targeting of people in vulnerable circumstances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “Our clients used the CBP One app because DHS required it. To now strip them of their rights and threaten them with deportation is a gross violation of the law and public trust. We’re honored to represent these individuals and to fight for accountability and justice. We will continue to go to court and use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable.”

“When the government strips away a person’s status and work permit, it pushes entire families into poverty, destabilizes communities, and forces people to choose between basic survival and compliance with an unjust policy,” said Georgia Katsoulomitis, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. “Ending parole status in this way is both unlawful and harmful to immigrant families by making them more vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation. “

The plaintiffs are asking the court to reverse the termination of their parole and work authorization, restore their ability to stay, work, and apply for asylum or other immigration relief, and stop DHS from carrying out future mass arbitrary revocations of parole status.

The three-day trial kicked off in San Francisco, with attorneys for the state arguing the deployment — which California Gov. Gavin Newsom strenuously objected to — violated a federal law against using military forces for domestic law enforcement.

The protests began June 6 as lawful demonstrations stemming from a series of raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that saw more than 100 illegal immigrants rounded up around the city.

Hundreds took to the streets, chanting in opposition and waving Mexican flags and anti-ICE signs while clashing with cops and federal immigration officers.

But the protests soon escalated into full-blown riots, with cars burned in the streets, public buildings vandalized and local businesses pillaged by looters.

As the violence dragged on, President Trump announced he was deploying some 4,000 Coast Guard members and around 700 active-duty Marines to the City of Angels to put an end to the anarchy.

Newsom condemned the deployments, saying it amounted to using soldiers as “props in the federal government’s propaganda machine.”

The Trump administration fired back, arguing the state’s sanctuary city laws preventing local law enforcement from upholding immigration laws made federal intervention necessary.

Newsom sued the administration, and federal Judge Charles R. Breyer — a former President Clinton appointee who is overseeing the California bench trial — ruled the deployment was illegal.

However, hours later an appeals court rejected Breyer’s ruling which cleared the way for the mobilization to continue.

By July 1, nearly all of the National Guard members and Marines called to Los Angeles had been released, with around 300 still in the city.

Those remaining on duty are “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agencies, William Harrington, former deputy chief of staff for the Army task force in charge of the Guard troops said in court Monday, according to the New York Times.

The trial could set a legal precedent for the extent of a commander-in-chief’s authority over the military on US soil.

Newsom’s lawyers are vehement that sending troops to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the president from using armed forces to engage in civil law enforcement.

Attorneys for the state also argue that by deploying troops over the objections of the governor and other California officials, Trump violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which delineates the balance of power between the federal government and US states.

Also being alleged is that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth violated the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing they “lack authority to federalize members of the California National Guard without issuing such orders through Governor Newsom,” the complaint reads.

Trump’s lawyers have staked their counter-argument on a little-known law — Section 12406(3) of the US Code — which permits the president to federalize the National Guard under certain circumstances.

Among them, if the US is in danger of being invaded or currently under invasion, if there is an ongoing rebellion or danger of one occurring, or if the president is unable “with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Newsom and California are seeking a formal declaration from the court that Trump and Hegseth’s orders were illegal, as well as injunctive relief, which would prohibit future deployments of the California National Guard without the governor’s express approval.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/trump-newsom-square-off-federal-109482302.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-11 22:57:32.494354

""All our lives, we are taught to fear masked men in unmarked vehicles. We learn we should run from such men to avoid being kidnapped, sexually assaulted, or killed,"" 33 members of the Democratic Women's Caucus (DWC) wrote in a letter led by Reps. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas), and Nydia Velásquez (D-N.Y.) to Trump administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, and ""border czar"" Tom Homan.

""Yet, ICE is increasingly conducting raids and arrests in masks [and] plain clothes, without visible identification or badges, using unmarked vehicles—tactics that cause confusion, terror, and mistrust among the public,"" the letter continues. ""These tactics invited perpetrators of violence against women to take advantage of the chaos by impersonating masked ICE agents in order to target and sexually assault women.""

Reports of masked men—and in one case, a woman—impersonating federal officers began emerging shortly after President Donald Trump returned to the White House and ordered a mass deportation campaign that senior adviser Stephen Miller said aims to arrest at least 3,000 people per day. Since then, there have been reports of impostors abducting and subsequently sexually assaulting, robbing, or extorting women in states including Maryland, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

""This cannot continue and must be addressed immediately,"" the DWC letter insists. ""The Democratic Women's Caucus is committed to defending the rights of all women and girls to live in safety. We call on the department to recognize this pervasive issue and to take immediate action.""

""We demand that ICE agents visibly and clearly identify themselves when conducting immigration enforcement activities to stop enabling impersonators who leverage women's uncertainty and fear of immigration consequences to rape, harass, and abuse them,"" the congresswoman wrote.

""Your current practices leave women vulnerable to life-altering violence,"" the letter adds. ""It's past time to act. Just like local police officers, ICE agents must be required to wear visible and clear identification to ensure their safety, better protect women, and deter impersonators. Finally, impersonators must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law and this violence must be denounced by this administration.""

In a bid to unmask federal agents, Velázquez in June introduced the No Masks for ICE Act, which would ban agents from wearing facial coverings during enforcement actions and require them to wear clothing displaying their name and agency affiliation.

House lawmakers led by Reps. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) in June also introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would require all Department of Homeland Security and other federal law enforcement officers to show their faces and clearly display their badges and identification when detaining or arresting people.

Similar legislation—the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act of 2025—was introduced last month in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Also in July, upper chamber lawmakers led by Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kain (D-Va.) proposed the similar Immigration Enforcement Identification Act.

Watch the segment in the player above.

In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law.

“ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

We're not going anywhere.

The Department of Homeland Security has put its Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s recruitment efforts into overdrive. As ICE attempts to boost its numbers to carry out Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the agency is carrying out an ad blitz. According to 404 Media, DHS is looking to run ads on streaming services like HBO Max and Hulu.

The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.”

The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown.

When it comes to hiring requirements, the immigration agency is lowering the bar. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks.

DHS is not only making it easier to become an ICE agent, but more financially attractive as well. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay.

The recruitment push is working. We know that it has brought in at least one new high-profile agent: 59-year-old actor and vocal Trump supporter Dean Cain, who once played Superman on TV. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.”

Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. You can’t make this stuff up.

Jokes aside, this drive to hire more personnel seems to be ideologically driven. ICE used to require employees to have an undergraduate degree, but not anymore. Apparently, you don’t even need a uniform. So many of the arrests we’re witnessing are being carried out by masked plainclothes officers.

The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown.

It’s almost like the president is building an army of sycophants — and he has the money to do it. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Just to put this into perspective: ICE now receives more funds and resources than most national militaries. It’s rapidly becoming the nation’s largest domestic police force, its size and power doubling that of the FBI.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-ali-velshi-ice-split-vl-1242p-600d2f.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 20:56:54.969049
