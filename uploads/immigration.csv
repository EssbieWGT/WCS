Wood Middle School football field campus on Monday, Oct. 13.

Multiple sources confirmed that when approached by district staff, the individuals identified themselves as ICE and left the property in their vehicle after district staff requested that they do so.

The district sent a message to the Wood community shortly after.

“Earlier today, school staff received a report that an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) vehicle was parked on campus near the Wood football field. District staff engaged with the officials and were told that the vehicle was there for surveillance of the general area. Staff informed the agents that they were parked on private school property and asked them to leave, which they did shortly after. Our School Resource Officer and Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office are aware of this occurrence. We know that the presence of any type of law enforcement presence on campus can create questions or concern for students, staff and community members. We want all of our students, staff, and community members to know that their well-being is our top priority,” the district said in the message.

“It makes me worry for these kids and their parents,” said Wilsonville High School science teacher Harold Coller, who was on his way to help fellow teachers at Wood during a free period when he saw the ICE vehicle. “They (ICE)may leave before school gets out, but we just wanted to make sure; this is the first time we’ve had to deal with anything like this. And I know, just from reading the news and being in Portland, how this administration likes to blatantly lie about conditions on the ground and what is happening. I know that these masked agents working for the federal government have assaulted people and people’s rights repeatedly with very little accountability.”

,Litigation,2025-10-13 21:42:15+00:00,News From The States,"Metro's cooperation with ICE violates state law, says ACLU of Nevada lawsuit",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/metros-cooperation-ice-violates-state-law-says-aclu-nevada-lawsuit,"Nevada’s cooperation with federal agents violates state law, is eroding the integrity of the judicial system, and is hurting tourism, the ACLU alleges.
The agreement violates Nevada law, according to the lawsuit, because it was not condoned by state lawmakers.
“I recognize the tough position that the sheriff’s been put in, that the Mayor of the city of Las Vegas has been put in when they signed an agreement,” Haseebullah noted.
Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives.
In 2019, then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada is challenging the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s agreement with the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to assist the federal agency by holding individuals in custody beyond their release. Nevada’s cooperation with federal agents violates state law, is eroding the integrity of the judicial system, and is hurting tourism, the ACLU alleges.

“This isn’t intended to disparage LVMPD,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said Monday at a news conference announcing the legal action against Metro and Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill. He suggests Metro acquiesced to the federal government because of President Donald Trump’s “administration’s perpetual threats against municipalities, local governments and state governments.”

Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE, named for a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows police to issue civil immigration warrants and detain individuals up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so that federal agents may take them into custody. The agreement violates Nevada law, according to the lawsuit, because it was not condoned by state lawmakers.

Nevada is a Dillon’s Rule state, Haseebullah noted, meaning “if the Nevada Legislature does not grant authority for the local agency to act, the agency cannot do that action.”

State law provides that county jails may house prisoners at the request of the federal government, “but only upon payment of ‘all actual and reasonably necessary costs’ of such confinement,” the suit says, adding even if the term ‘prisoner’ referred to someone with a civil immigration infraction, Metro’s agreement with ICE violates Dillon’s Rule, because it requires Metro to cover all associated costs.

The suit was filed on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who was found guilty of attempted possession of a stolen vehicle, a gross misdemeanor. He was sentenced by Judge Tara Newberry Clark to an inpatient treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health, and upon completion, to outpatient treatment. Instead, he is being held in the Clark County Detention Center.

“The unlawful hold, caused by ICE’s 287(g) agreement with LVMPD, has trapped him in indefinite detention, directly obstructing a lawful court order issued by a Nevada judge,” the ACLU said in a news release. The filing asks a court to lift the hold and order Metro to end its agreement.

The suit, Haseebullah said, is another ACLU has “had to file because of this administration’s desire to create as much instability as they can within our communities.”

He says he expects the case to land before the Nevada Supreme Court.

“We’d love to get the proper outcome at the District Court level, but I imagine this will go up,” he said at the news conference. “We need a substantive ruling to know whether or not Nevada municipalities or local law enforcement agencies have the ability to act without approval from the state that funds them in large part.”

McMahill, who long maintained Metro would not assist federal agents with immigration enforcement, entered into a 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with ICE on June 16 of this year, according to the lawsuit, “after the federal government idiotically labeled Las Vegas a ‘sanctuary city’ without even defining ‘sanctuary city,’ and forced Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work…” Haseebullah said. An exhibit attached to the suit reveals that as of Sept. 1, LVMPD received 957 requests for assistance from ICE this year.

“In Nevada, sheriffs and political subdivisions, such as LVMPD, have no existence or powers except by grant of Nevada’s Legislature,” says the ACLU’s pleading.

“I recognize the tough position that the sheriff’s been put in, that the Mayor of the city of Las Vegas has been put in when they signed an agreement,” Haseebullah noted. “We recognize the decisions made by this administration don’t come with any sort of intellectual honesty.”

The sanctuary designation, he noted, is a “legal misnomer” that is bereft of common definition.

Nevada was removed from the federal list of sanctuary designations last month after Gov. Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives.

In 2019, then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations. Nevada was not among those states.

Lombardo, however, informally honored provisions of the agreement after he announced its suspension.

“Immigrants can’t be the scapegoat for all the things that go wrong in this country.","CHICAGO — Three decades after she came to the U.S., on Tuesday 53-year-old Maricela Rosales Castillo put her hair in a ponytail, grabbed her favorite blue sweater and backpack, and left her home in Berwyn, Illinois, to head to a market for groceries. She was planning to make albóndigas, a meatball stew, for her children that day.

She didn’t make it far.

Just steps away from her house, she was intercepted by a group of Border Patrol agents armed and wearing dark masks. These agents, whose primary mandate is to secure the national borders, are now patrolling Chicago suburbs.

It’s part of Operation Midway Blitz, a campaign the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched Sept. 8 saying it would target “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in the area.

But the government’s own data and detentions like that of Rosales — a mother of three who has no apparent criminal record — cast serious doubt on whether that’s really the mission.

On Oct. 3, DHS announced that since the operation began in September, more than 1,000 undocumented migrants had been arrested across Chicago and its suburbs — “including the worst of the worst pedophiles, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers.” However, the agency provided detailed information for only 10 men with a criminal background, about 1% of those detained, making independent verification difficult.

In one particularly jarring raid, on Sept. 30 federal agents with Black Hawk helicopters and military-type vehicles descended on an apartment complex in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood. DHS said the location was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members,” a Venezuelan criminal gang targeted by the Trump administration.

According to DHS, 37 people were arrested during the operation; however, only eight of them were confirmed to have a criminal record — and that includes crimes ranging from aggravated battery to retail theft. The agency did not say whether any of those cases resulted in convictions.

Just one “verified” Tren de Aragua member and one U.S. citizen with an active warrant were among the 37, DHS said, without saying how it had verified that gang affiliation. Others taken that day, the agency said, were “illegal aliens.”

In other words, while the administration says it is disrupting transnational gang activity, the bulk of those detained seem to have no serious record. In fact, federal data shows that over 70% of detainees who were being held as of last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement nationally had no criminal convictions.

One of Rosales’ daughters, Samantha Rojas Rosales, only learned about her mother’s detention after watching a video obtained by MSNBC. “That’s her,” she said. “She always wears that blue sweater.”

In tears, Rojas said these immigration operations ostensibly aimed at gangsters are tearing families apart. Her mother came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1995, she said.

“She has worked hard. She has paid her taxes. She’s done everything possible to make sure she isn’t a problem here,” the 21-year-old daughter said. “And she has raised me here my entire life.”

Asked about the arrest, a Homeland Security official focused on what Rosales did 30 years ago: “Rosales Castillo admitted to being illegally present in the U.S. to Border Patrol officers which is a crime,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told MSNBC in an email.

Grabbed up while grabbing coffee

The same morning Rosales was arrested, just blocks away in Cicero — an area with the highest concentration of Latinos in the state — another immigration operation unfolded. Two mechanics, Mario Martínez Serrano and Daniel Cabrera García, were standing outside a bakery drinking coffee when unmarked vehicles and Border Patrol agents surrounded them.

Surveillance footage obtained by MSNBC shows Border Patrol agents chasing the men inside the bakery. Cabrera was violently thrown to the ground, three witnesses said. Both men were taken away in an unmarked vehicle.

Rosie Rodríguez, who has an insurance agency next door to the bakery and witnessed the arrests, told MSNBC that immigration agents are snatching away “good people.”

“They’re my clients. These are hardworking men. These are not criminals,” she said.

DHS disagrees.

Martínez is a “criminal illegal alien with an extensive criminal history, including arrests for battery, DUI, domestic abuse, possession of a controlled substance, and two prior removals from the U.S.,” McLaughlin told MSNBC.

Martínez’s wife, who did not want to be named for fear of immigration authorities, said he's lived in Illinois for 30 years. She acknowledged he’s “made mistakes in the past, but in the 10 years we have been together he had no issues with the law. He’s a good husband, a father to two teenage U.S. citizens, and a hard worker.”

Cabrera’s cousin, David González, described him as a family provider. “He’s a good man. He had dreams. He was about to open his own car shop. He didn’t do anything wrong. Now everyone around here feels like a target, even U.S. citizens like me,” he said.

Asked about Cabrera’s case, McLaughlin only said he was “an illegal alien from Mexico who attempted to evade arrest.”

The scene in Chicago

Over a five-day span in greater Chicago, MSNBC received dozens of reports from families and neighbors alleging that their loved ones had been taken by immigration officials, seemingly without any reason other than being undocumented.

On Wednesday — the day after the detentions in Cicero and Berwyn — two sisters were stopped and dragged out of their vehicle in front of a school in Chicago’s Little Italy neighborhood by at least 10 agents, some of them wearing face coverings. Video obtained and verified by MSNBC shows one of the women pinned to the ground as she pleaded for help.

“They don’t have a warrant. They forcefully opened the door of the truck. It was locked, it was locked,” the woman repeated. MSNBC confirmed both women were later released.

“When Donald Trump campaigned, he said he was going after criminals, rapists and drug dealers,” said Humberto Fuentes, a resident who said he witnessed the women being detained. “Now, they’re assaulting women, deporting children, mothers and fathers — not criminals. And if they’re criminals, he needs to prove it. We haven’t seen that evidence yet.”

That’s the main argument being made by legal observers and state and local officials, including Gov. JB Pritzker.

“It’s not going after the worst of the worst when you’re just literally stopping people who happen to be brown and asking them for papers,” Pritzker told MSNBC. “We don’t want people picked up off the streets just because they happen to be undocumented and have committed no crime.”

President Trump insists Chicago is in crisis, that undocumented migrants are driving crime and that Democratic leaders including Pritzker aren’t doing anything about it.

A number of studies have found that immigrants — including undocumented ones — are less likely to commit crimes than Americans born in the U.S., and challenged claims that unauthorized immigration increases violence.

In Chicago, which has received over 50,000 asylum-seekers since 2022, ""Violent crime is down,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson told the U.S. House Oversight Committee in March, adding that ""the city ended 2024 with its lowest homicide rate in five years.”

In the first six months of 2025, those numbers declined even further, with all major crime categories lower than during the same period in 2024.

“We are good people,” insisted Fuentes, who is from Mexico and has lived in Chicago for 22 years. “Immigrants can’t be the scapegoat for all the things that go wrong in this country. Sooner or later, someone will have to admit this is all for show.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251013-jacob-soboroff-chicago-zz-05-7c0ab6.jpg",N,,2025-10-13 18:56:53.803708

“I see it very prevalent in my community here from Orlando, Florida, with our Haitian community that is being targeted, and also with Black Latinos that are being targeted,” Frost said during a panel discussion at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s legislative conference in Washington, D.C.

The discussion came on the day that Des Moines Public Schools superintendent Ian Roberts, who is Guyanese, was detained. School district officials said they had no information on why he was being held.

Frost questioned the need for ICE.

“The fact of the matter is that we have other federal law enforcement to help ensure that we have an orderly and humane immigration process at the federal level,” he said. “Creating a whole agency to literally go to our communities and now en masse and terrorize our people, I think is not needed.”

President Donald Trump has authorized National Guard troops to take over law enforcement duties in Washington D.C., and dispatched them to cities led by Black Democratic mayors, including Los Angeles and Memphis, while weighing whether to send troops to Baltimore, Chicago and New Orleans.

Some Republican governors such as Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and Mike DeWine of Ohio were quick to send their National Guard units to D.C., while Republican Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee deployed troops to Memphis, his state’s second largest city, in aid of Trump’s orders.

Haddy Gassama, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said people need to know the laws in their states.

Gassama said local and state agencies can participate in 287g agreements with ICE, allowing the federal agency to delegate certain tasks to state and local law enforcement officials such as executing warrants in their jails and identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement.

“The Trump administration has said that their goal is to, just this year alone, detain and potentially deport up to 100,000 immigrants.

The immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them Thursday, Cruz told the Tribune.

“They asked us if we have papers. I said I do but I don’t have them on me,” Cruz, a 60-year old man with heart problems originally from El Salvador, recalled in Spanish.

The agents stood Cruz up, put him in their truck, drove around in circles, and asked questions, he said.

Where was he born? What is his name? Who is his mother? Who is his father?

“I told them, they are dead,” Cruz said. The agents said they needed the information anyway so they could look him up in their databases. Eventually, the agents verified that he is, in fact, legally in the country. And they let him go.

But not before writing him a $130 ticket for not having his papers. Cruz’s friend, who is homeless, did not have legal status and was taken away by the feds.

Under federal law, registered foreign nationals must carry proof of registration with them at all times. But prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced. As President Donald Trump escalates his immigration crackdown in Chicago and its suburbs, “Operation Midway Blitz,” agents are using broad federal authority when targeting suspected immigrants, legal experts say.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Oct. 1 that it had made 800 arrests in the area since the mission began at the beginning of September.

ICE arrests increase across Chicago under Trump, many with no convictions, data shows

While federal officials claim they are targeting the “worst of the worst,” bystanders have been swept up and people across Chicagoland have accused the government of widespread civil rights violations. In blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois last week, U.S. District Judge April Perry said the federal government had a credibility problem that made many of their claims “unreliable.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago told the Tribune it has not yet seen any of its clients receive this sort of citation. But it’s part of a recent push by the Trump administration to ensure immigrants register with authorities and maintain their documentation to them at all times or face potential penalties.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center calls it a “hateful tactic” meant to “cause panic and fear throughout the country.”

“America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident — and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers — is unnecessary and cruel,” said Ed Yohnka, communications director for the ACLU of Illinois. “It does not make our communities stronger or more safe. It is simply part of the Trump administration’s attempt to make life uncomfortable for all immigrants. It is just awful.”

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not return messages seeking comment.

It’s not clear how many individuals have been ticketed for not having their papers on them. The ticket Cruz showed the Tribune references a law requiring immigrants to be registered with the government and have their registration documents.

A former dishwasher, Cruz lives in a government-funded apartment but isn’t working due to his health. Cruz said he was relieved to be released but worries how he will pay the fine. The ICE agents told Cruz he has to pay it within 60 days or go to court.

“It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident,” Cruz said.

In Chicago, immigrants who thought they were following the legal path are also facing deportation under Trump crackdown

U.S. citizens say they’re also being questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, had just finished working a double shift at the Beach Bar on Ohio Street earlier this month when she said she was surrounded by three federal agents who grabbed her, forced her hands behind her back and zip-tied her.

Headphones in, Greeley had been focused on getting home to her two dogs for a walk. Instead, she said she was detained by masked agents who did not answer when she asked for names. They questioned her for an hour, she said.

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic hospital and is adopted, carries a copy of her passport just in case she runs into federal agents.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley said. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

During the encounter, Greeley said they told her she “doesn’t look like” a Greeley.

“They said this isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Greeley recalled. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

When the agents let her go, Greeley got home and screamed when she saw the shadow on her door. Days after the incident, Greeley said, it’s still “terrifying.”

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said, tearing up. “All those other people are getting taken.”

Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents. Hundreds turned out.

Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, represents the Far North Side neighborhood on Chicago’s City Council. She said it was an effort to “recognize people from our community who were taken” and bring people together “to remind them that we are not powerless.”

The protest organizer group, Protect Rogers Park, posted on Facebook: “Today 400+ Rogers Parkers gathered to mourn, celebrate, defy authoritarianism, (canvass) and recommit to loving their neighbors. Oh, and buy a lot of tacos.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-ICE-rogers-park-1009-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-13 18:57:09.336587

In a statement, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said she decided on the restriction after protests outside the facility on Saturday night ""degenerated into chaos.""

""There were 15 arrests, and 10 of those were around the age of my own daughter. As a mother and a mayor, I am mad at what happened,"" Thompson said in the statement. ""Broadview didn't choose to have the ICE facility in our community. But it's here. And so are Broadview residents.""

Thompson wrote that some of the protesters have been making life difficult for Broadview residents.

""There are too many protesters are raising their fists rather than their voices, creating chaos at the expense of the people who call Broadview home,"" she wrote. ""Broadview residents lack the protestors' privilege to return to calm, quiet neighborhoods for undisturbed rest.""

For that reason, Thompson said she has signed a new executive order in consultation with the Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff's office, which will permit protests only in the safety zone at the ICE facility on Beach Street. Protests will no longer be allowed at 2000 S. 25th Ave. between Lexington and Fillmore streets, Thompson wrote.

""Additionally, it has been only God's grace alone that a protester has not been struck and killed by a motorist on 25th Avenue given how frequently protesters dash onto this busy, four-lane street,"" Thompson wrote. ""This new measure will provide for both the serenity of residents and safety of protestors.""

Thompson emphasized that she respects, supports, and defends everyone's right to protest, and decried the use of chemical munitions by federal agents at the site.

""Nevertheless, my first priority is to defend public safety and the residents who live here and people who work here,"" she wrote.

On Monday, barriers were placed on South 25th to prevent protestors from spilling into the streets.

Protester Jon Ort, one of the few demonstrators standing outside, said it seems as if the facility is being fortified.

""We are a city where we protect one another,"" he said.

Neighbors came out too when they realized the barriers had been put down. Some were placed on top of their plants.

James Baker lives on South 25th and says it's been almost impossible getting in and out of his home in the last few weeks.

""I went to the grocery store four days ago. Me and my son had to carry groceries from the end of that light right there to the house,"" Baker said.

Around the corner from where the barriers were placed, Thompson stood with other local mayors and elected leaders. She explained the barriers are meant to keep people out of the streets when protests spill over the sidewalk. A judge's order will soon take the fence outside the facility down.

""This unity is more powerful than any show of force that has come from the other side of that illegal that illegally build fence,"" Thompson said.

This comes after Thompson signed an earlier executive order restricting protest times to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

New York recently enacted a law permitting the New York Public Employment Relations Board to assert its jurisdiction over private employers

The National Labor Relations Board has filed a lawsuit challenging the law, arguing that it is preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution

Amazon has also filed a lawsuit challenging the law on similar grounds

On September 5, 2025, New York Senate Bill S.8034A was signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul, effective immediately. The law amends Section 715 of the New York State Labor Relations Act, permitting the New York Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to assert jurisdiction over private-sector employers. PERB is an agency created by Section 205 of New York Civil Service Law, which traditionally oversees public-sector labor relations.

The law’s sponsor memo indicates that its purpose is to ensure “employees still receive protections by the National Labor Relations Act” when the NLRB is unable to successfully assert jurisdiction. Currently, the NLRB lacks a quorum, which limits its authority.

In response to the law’s enactment, on September 12, 2025, the NLRB filed a lawsuit against the State of New York and PERB in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the law. The NLRB argues (1) that the law is preempted by the NLRA under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution; and (2) that the law usurps the NLRB’s authority to regulate areas which are “explicitly reserved for federal oversight.”

On September 30, 2025, the NLRB filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin New York State and PERB from implementing and enforcing the law. The NLRB argues that the law “creates a parallel regulatory system that undermines the federal labor policy Congress designed to be national in scope.” Stated differently, the NLRB argues that its congressionally granted jurisdiction over private employers has been directly displaced by PERB under the law. Moreover, the NLRB argues that in the absence of a preliminary injunction there is a threat of imminent irreparable harm since the law operates to displace the NLRB’s jurisdiction even after its quorum is restored. The NLRB argues that a preliminary injunction is in the public’s best interest and that issuing an injunction is favorable because the NLRB will continue to process labor practice cases and PERB can continue to oversee public-sector labor matters.

On September 22, 2025, Amazon also filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against PERB and PERB officials, seeking to strike down the law for similar reasons as the NLRB. In response, PERB has filed a motion seeking to halt this lawsuit, given the parallel lawsuit that the NLRB has already filed. Meanwhile, certain unions have filed a motion to intervene in both lawsuits seeking to have the law upheld, and certain business associations have sought to file briefs in both lawsuits in support of the arguments that the law should be struck down. These legal battles are expected to play out over the next several months.

Lawmakers in other states have already adopted or considered laws which displace the NLRB’s jurisdiction. For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law which will expand the jurisdiction of the California PERB to private-sector employees, effective in 2026. Additionally, Massachusetts is considering a law which would make key aspects of the NLRA part of state law. Similar challenges to the legality of bills in other states are expected.

New York employers should continue to monitor developments in these cases, assess their labor policies, and prepare for possible situations where PERB seeks jurisdiction over private-sector matters.

And I think that’s what it’s starting to become in some ways.

“I had at least one girlfriend from Broadview, I'm sure of it,” Rivers said, adding a little levity to the session.","CHICAGO – A day before arriving in his hometown of Chicago for a game between his Milwaukee Bucks and the Bulls at the United Center, Glenn “Doc” Rivers spoke about his team busing down for the game on Oct. 11 and said, “hopefully we get through the night, and not get arrested by ICE. And then we’ll be in good shape. Lot of brown people on our team.”

That set the stage for Rivers, on the eve of his 64th birthday, to express his disappointment and anger about the mass arrests by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago.

“It bothers me. I’m trying, I’m trying; I mean, it’s just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that’s not this country. That’s not what we’re about,” Rivers said in his pregame press conference Oct. 12 at the United Center, located on Chicago’s west side.

""I think the mayor’s (Brandon Johnson) done an amazing job with everything he says. You know, I think this is starting to separate us all, which I hate. This is not, you can be pro-civil rights or what’s right and not be, like, anti-white. And I think that’s what it’s starting to become in some ways. And it shouldn’t be. It really shouldn’t be. I would hope that if this was Ukrainian immigrants being detained that everyone on both races would fight for it. That’s wrong. It’s just wrong.

“I think every American is good with if there’s criminals on the street, we want to arrest the criminals. My dad (Grady) was a (Maywood) cop for Christ’s sakes. My dad would not be proud of this. I know that. My dad would have a major problem; I couldn’t imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they’re doing. I couldn’t imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he’d call in sick. And it’s just so – did you walk around the city today? This is an amazing city.

“Riding down the elevator with a couple, I wish I could remember where they’re from, their daughter ran in the marathon and the couple was so proud and they were saying, man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I’ve never been to this city, wow. And the dad says, but we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere. And he was like, ‘where is it?’ It’s nowhere. It’s just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I’m from Chicago. I’m very prideful about this place, so I hate it.”

Since the beginning of October, ICE raids in and around Chicago have escalated – along with protests of its activities – resulting in President Donald Trump deploying members of the Texas National Guard to the city.Rivers is a Chicago native who grew up in Maywood, Illinois, a village just west of the city. Maywood is also located just blocks from Broadview, which is the location of an ICE processing facility and has been the site of continued protests.

“I had at least one girlfriend from Broadview, I'm sure of it,” Rivers said, adding a little levity to the session. “Yeah, it's awful. I know it well. My brother (Grady Jr.) lives in Elmhurst. You gotta go from Maywood to Broadview to drive through it. Again, it's the same thing. And it almost feels like it's intentional, like they're trying to create unrest. It wasn't here, and now it's here.

""It's just, there's gotta be a solution. I mean, protest is legal. You should be able to protest, and I think it's being made violent in some ways, so I don't know. Antifa? Does anyone know what that is? I actually looked today. I really did. I actually looked it up and there were 15 different answers for it. Yet we have all these other groups. The Proud Boys, no one's going after (them). It's just, this is getting sickening.

At least five U.S. airports will not air a politicized video message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming the government shutdown on Democrats—but a legal expert tells Forbes the video does not violate the Hatch Act, which restricts federal employees from some kinds of partisan messaging.

Key Facts

Does Kristi Noem’s Video Violate The Hatch Act?

“This is probably not a Hatch Act violation, because it's not tied to an election,” Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the non-partisan ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), told Forbes. “But it's entirely inappropriate to be using federal resources to message on a partisan basis and disparage the opposing political party.” The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees—with carve outs for the president and vice president—from making partisan attacks while on the job “to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation,” according to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). A 2021 report from the OSC found 13 administration officials from President Donald Trump’s first term violated the Hatch Act by engaging in partisan messaging, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, acting secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security adviser Robert O’Brien. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway violated the act dozens of times in her official capacity, according to a 2019 OSC report recommending that Trump fire her.

What Is The Penalty For A Hatch Act Violation?

None, unless Trump decides otherwise. “As a general matter, if you violate the Hatch Act, you are subject to discipline” including potential suspension, loss of pay or even removal from position, Brown told Forbes. “But there aren't a lot of teeth for the most senior officials, when it is someone at the cabinet level who reports to the President.” The 2021 OSC report concluded that “the Hatch Act is only as effective as the White House decides it will be” and noted “President Trump’s failure to ensure compliance by his senior officials allowed for, as one federal court said of a senior administration official, members of the administration to ‘violate the Hatch Act with seeming impunity.’”

Tangent

A memo sent last week from Ha Nguyen McNeill, acting administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), blaming “Senate Democrats’ recalcitrance” for the shutdown angered many in the workforce, according to three TSA officers who told Forbes “people are very put-off by this rhetoric” and “we feel sickened.”

And within the deference states, there still lies significant variation.","What You Need to Know in a Minute or Less

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo shook the legal world when it overturned one of the cornerstones of administrative law: the Chevron doctrine. Established by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Chevron doctrine directed federal courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency administers.

In Part I of this series, we looked at how the federal courts have begun to implement Loper Bright one year after the seminal case; here, we dive into where things stand at the state level.

In a minute or less, here is what you need to know.

States Still Free to Go Their Own Ways

The Chevron doctrine was a rule about how courts should interpret federal law; state courts were never bound by it.1 In overturning Chevron, Loper Bright relied purely on statutory grounds under the Administrative Procedure Act. Because of this, state courts and state agencies are not bound by this decision either. However, many states tend to look to federal law and its trends as persuasive precedent for their own legal structures.

State of Play in the States

While at least 34 states give some level of deference to state agencies, there has been a recent trend limiting or eliminating such agency deference.2 In 2025 alone, North Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kentucky have either ended or significantly limited deference to state agencies.

Generally, states are split into four general categories regarding deference practices:

Fifteen states provide substantial deference to state agencies similar or stronger than Chevron. Examples include Illinois, D.C., and Massachusetts.3

Fourteen states provide a moderate level of deference, although with great variety. Some states use a sliding scale to determine the weight of deference, others only providing deference to the interpretation of regulations but not statues, and some add additional tests that must be met in order for deference to attach. These standards vary and there are many unique tests for states that fall under this category. For example, Connecticut provides Chevron-like deference, but only if the agency’s interpretation has been previously subjected to judicial scrutiny or is “time tested.”4 In North Carolina, interpretations are treated as non-binding, with deference based on the ability of the agency to persuade the court. In Michigan, interpretations are given “due consideration,” but courts must provide “cogent reasons” for overturning.

Four states appear inconsistent in their application of deference, with courts ruling both for deference and de novo review or declining to formally set rules of deference. Examples include Nevada and South Dakota.

Eighteen states provide no deference.5

Despite Shift From Deference, States Remain Diverse

Even with seven states limiting deference this year, states that apply deference outnumber the states that don’t. And within the deference states, there still lies significant variation. Some states such as Illinois provide a “presumption of correctness” even in the absence of ambiguity, while others, such as Maryland, provide deference to regulatory interpretations based on a multi-factored sliding scale test. Virginia applies deference based on the ability of the agency to persuade the court based on reasoning and expertise.

The recent shift to abolish or limit deference is also not universal. The Hawai’ian Supreme Court rejected the reasoning set forth in Loper Bright, stating: “[n]ow, the U.S. Supreme Court considers itself and other federal courts the experts on exceedingly complicated areas of American Life…In Hawai‘i, we defer to those agencies with the na‘auao (knowledge/wisdom) on particular subject matters to get complex issues right.”6

The Takeaway

While the abandonment of the Chevron doctrine has led many states to end or restrict deference to state agencies, there still remains significant variation in state application. This trend is not likely to change anytime soon.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/litigation%20courts%20verdict%20word%20cloud%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=T7rwXqBc,N,,2025-10-13 13:57:18.450733

The statement also cited a sharp increase in assaults against ICE officers, though reporting from Colorado Public Radio suggests those claims are overblown.","There are countless videos on social media showing similar scenes. One, filmed by a photographer in Hyattsville, Md., shows a man pinned to the ground by two ICE officers. He pleads in Spanish and English for someone to help him.

During the incident, one of the officers drops his gun and fumbles for it. Then, he appears to point it at bystanders. Emily Covington, an assistant director in ICE's Office of Public Affairs, told NPR in a statement that drawing a weapon can be used as a de-escalation tactic.

Another video, from Broadview, Ill., near Chicago, appears to show a man outside an ICE facility getting shot in the head with a pepper ball, a projectile filled with chemical irritants. That man, Pastor David Black, has sued the Trump administration.

Late last month, a local CBS reporter said a masked ICE agent fired a pepper ball at her car at that same facility, causing her to vomit for hours. The reporter, Asal Rezaei, said there was no protest happening at the time. Broadview Police are now investigating.

""These are just the tip of the iceberg,"" says Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ""People being tackled, people getting pepper sprayed or tear gassed. We've seen people getting threatened. And we've seen at least two incidents involving gunfire.""

A majority of Americans do not approve of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, according to a recent survey from The New York Times and Siena University. Yet in Chicago, immigrant advocate groups say federal immigration officers are escalating those tactics and becoming more violent.

""This administration overall seems more interested in heightening the tensions instead of trying to ramp them down,"" Tsao says.

In late September, federal officers broke down doors and arrested dozens of people during a massive apartment raid on Chicago's south side.

Earlier this month, federal officers shot a woman in the city, and a few weeks before, they killed a man in a nearby suburb. In both shootings, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the victims threatened officers. But in body camera footage from the fatal shooting, the officer who responded says his injuries are ""nothing major.""

In the case of the woman, her lawyer says officer body camera footage from the incident contradicts that narrative, too. On Thursday, a grand jury indicted her and another man, alleging that they ""impeded, intimidated and interfered"" with the duties of a federal officer.

""What we're seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,"" says Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois, which has brought a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating the constitutional rights of protesters.

In Covington's statement to NPR, she said ICE officers are ""highly trained and act accordingly with law and policy."" The statement also cited a sharp increase in assaults against ICE officers, though reporting from Colorado Public Radio suggests those claims are overblown.

Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, says federal immigration officers are not prepared for what is being asked of them.

""They do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment,"" says Kerlikowske, who was also the police chief in Seattle and police commissioner in Buffalo, N.Y.

Good policing in cities, he says, relies on de-escalation, trust and public cooperation. The show of force federal agents are using in Chicago and elsewhere is unnecessary, he says.

""These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job,"" Kerlikowske says. ""I couldn't be more disappointed.""

Courts have weighed in on the amount of force a police officer — whether they're local, state or federal — can legally use, and determined that any use-of-force must be ""objectively reasonable.""

""What does it mean to be objectively reasonable? That term by itself doesn't actually mean anything without context,"" says Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who trains police officers.

DHS, which includes ICE, uses that standard. The agency's most recent use-of-force policy notes that officers should only use force when ""no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist."" Among the agency's principles are ""de-escalation"" and ""respect for human life.""

For use of force to be constitutional, there must be a valid threat. But threats can range from someone with a gun, to someone resisting arrest, to many scenarios in between. How police respond to a situation also must be proportional to the danger of the situation.

""We look at the situation through the lens of the reasonable officer on the scene,"" adds Stoughton. ""It might be perfectly reasonable for an officer to step in front of someone, raise a hand and say, 'Stop. I need to talk to you.' And it would be totally unreasonable for the officer to put a gun in that person's face and say, 'Stop or I'm going to shoot you.'""

Many uses of force can be legally justified, but Stoughton says just because officers can do something doesn't mean they should.

""I don't think most people are asking the question, is this action in this particular video consistent or inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment?"" Stoughton says, referring to the law that governs searches and seizures, which also protects against excessive force. ""I think what they're asking is, is this a socially and democratically legitimate police action? And that's a very different question than whether it's a legal police action.""

Immigrant rights groups in Chicago, including the ACLU of Illinois, say federal agents are violating the law – by using ""violent force"" against protesters and others.

Because of that, they say it's important for bystanders to document what they witness, which helps make questions of force a little less open for interpretation.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5300x2981+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4d%2Fa8%2Fbaf668f44ed9a5363cc655419105%2Fgettyimages-2239229963.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 13:57:01.795049

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Oct. 3 incident in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood sent students running into the school and prompted teachers and staff to create a barrier between the children and federal authorities.

“The escalation of ICE raids does nothing to keep our young people safe; in fact, it makes them afraid, and it disrupts their learning,” Johnson, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said at a recent news conference.

Now, a new line of protection has surrounded students in the Chicago Public Schools system. Armed with whistles and know-your-rights pamphlets, these community volunteers call themselves “guardian angels.” Together, they secure the perimeters of elementary, middle and high schools across the city.

Asked about the incident, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls when protesters impeded the arrest of an alleged undocumented immigrant. In general, federal policy prohibits immigration authorities from raiding sensitive locations such as churches and schools, although agents have been seen conducting operations in nearby neighborhoods.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “During a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, U.S. Border Patrol vehicles were impeded by protesters. After repeated vocal attempts to disperse the crowd, USBP deployed tear gas and pepper balls. During this operation an illegal alien was arrested and later complained of a leg injury after attempting to flee law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution he was taken to the hospital for medical treatment.”

McLaughlin accused protesters of trying to break into the hospital where the detainee was receiving medical care after the arrest.

“Our brave officers are facing a surge in increase in assaults against them, including sniper attacks, cars being used as weapons on them, and assaults by rioters. This violence against law enforcement must END. We will not be deterred by rioters and protesters in keeping America safe,” she said in a statement.

Volunteers fan out across Chicago schools

When the call for volunteers went out, 500 community members stepped up, filling more than 1,000 shifts at nearly 100 schools on Chicago’s northwest side. The goal is to ensure students can attend class for an education without fear of a confrontation with ICE.

This “guardian angel” movement has continued to grow, and volunteers have shown up in droves daily at school pick-up and drop-off locations.

“They’re just regular people who understand that people have the right to eat, to work, to go to school,” said Juliet De Jesus of the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.

Johnson said he’s hopeful there won’t be a repeat of what happened outside the school, thanks to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits federal authorities from using force against citizens.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X.","Overview:

The deployment of the Texas National Guard to Illinois to support federal authorities in immigration enforcement has been ruled lawful by a federal judge, despite protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants' rights. The troops, who are currently under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command, will remain in a federalized status. The deployment is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, which has flooded Chicago with ICE agents using increasingly aggressive methods to apprehend undocumented immigrants.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

Fine said she is optimistic that the Illinois General Assembly will pass new restrictions on ICE agents when it reconvenes Tuesday.
Before introducing Fine, he emphasized that Chicago is a city of immigrants.","A coalition of local elected officials, led by State Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview) and advocacy groups, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, held a community workshop in Lovelace Park on Sunday in response to continued federal immigration crackdowns in the Chicago area.

Around 150 people attended the session, titled “Together For Our Neighbors: People’s Defense Workshop.” The event included updates from mutual aid and legal organizations, and advocacy groups fielded questions on a variety of topics, such as whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are required to read detainees their Miranda rights and to what extent local police are barred from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

After the event, several organizers and attendees traveled to the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, which has been the site of confrontations between protesters, political candidates and Department of Homeland Security agents.

Fine, who is running to replace U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston) in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, said her office has received an influx of messages from residents concerned about immigration raids in the district.

“Today, we heard that somebody was taken from the Home Depot in Evanston,” Fine said. “We had landscapers who were taken across the street from Glenbrook South High School when school was in session. This is happening in our communities with our friends, our neighbors, the people we shop with at the grocery store, the families that our kids go to school with.”

In an X post, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss confirmed ICE was present in Evanston on Sunday morning. Multiple community members were taken, and ICE was also present in Rogers Park, according to the post.

The Department of Homeland Security also arrested an individual in Evanston near the intersection of Church Street and Brown Avenue on Sept. 10, according to a city statement released later that week.

Fine said she is optimistic that the Illinois General Assembly will pass new restrictions on ICE agents when it reconvenes Tuesday.

Jewish Child and Family Services Chicago also participated to highlight the effect of ICE raids on mental health, Skokie resident and JCFS CEO Stacey Shor said.

“What we see happening is, for people who may be directly impacted, there’s increased isolation,” Shor said. “They’re afraid to leave their homes. People are afraid to go about their business.”

Organizers also collected food donations for communities affected by the raids. The concrete tiles around the speakers had “God Bless Democracy” and “Love Thy Neighbor” written on them in chalk.

Chicago resident Carter Cleland, an activist with the anti-war group Chicago Area Peace Action, held a sign reading “Jail Bibi” on one side and with a symbol of the “No Kings” movement on the other.

Cleland said he has hosted weekly rallies in Wilmette for the last eight months to protest against President Donald Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and climate change. Attending this workshop was another element of that activism, Cleland said.

Ben Isabel, Fine’s chief of staff, told the crowd that “no human being is illegal,” prompting cheers from attendees. Before introducing Fine, he emphasized that Chicago is a city of immigrants.

“Our immigrant neighbors are our coworkers, our classmates, our friends and our family,” Isabel said. “They deserve safety, dignity and the full protection of their rights.”

An excellent piece by Telnaes that can be taken a couple of ways. Certainly, the brutality of the lawless attacks has damaged our freedom, but you can also take Liberty as a personification of the American people and those who wish to be American and interpret the attacks as happening to all of us.

An eagle, or Uncle Sam, wouldn’t include the immigrants as effectively. We’ve spent the last century-plus glorifying the concept of immigrants and refugees seeing the Statue of Liberty as they sail into New York harbor despite the plain fact that not everyone arrives either by ship or through that port.

We invented the myth of the First Thanksgiving as an embodiment of the friendship of the established inhabitants for those who might come seeking freedom. And, oh, BTW, to fill jobs in our growing mines and factories.

This was part of a view of American history I call “the virus that spread from Plymouth Rock,” since the Jamestown colony was already more than a decade old when that friendly feast happened or perhaps never did.

And Spain had begun establishing settlements here as soon as Columbus landed, but our kids don’t learn about the extensive and important Spanish settlements in the West until the land had become part of the United States, or until the virus reached that part of the country.

Not only does history not happen until the white folks arrive, they have to be the right white folks, and the Know-Nothings of the 1830s and 40s were quite sure that Catholics, and especially Irish Catholics, were not who belonged here. The burning of the Charlestown Nunnery was only one of the attacks on the wrong kind of people by a group that had surprising political success peddling their bigoted program.

And, by golly, didn’t they come back about 75 years later.

And again 75 years after that.

The Know-Nothing Party is long gone, but the current crop of nativists creates their own mythology, and I wasn’t surprised this morning by a report on social media that another bullet has been found, proving that Kirk’s murder was part of a conspiracy, though there was no mention of a grassy knoll.

Though speaking of conspiracy theories, I got a laugh when it happened that I saw Whamond’s cartoon just before I spotted this on social media:

Humor is an effective tool against hate, though you have to be cautious, since bullies don’t like being made to look revealed to be stupid.

Bagley’s accusation is very effective at comforting the afflicted, but likely not so good at afflicting the comfortable, given that a substantial number of the bullies think the January 6 events were a good thing, even as they put “Support the Blue” stickers on their bumpers.

They should understand the second panel, but the combination doesn’t click for them. Which is how we got to where we are.

Again.

They do hate, but don’t see themselves as motivated by hatred. Telnaes paints Noem as the evil reincarnation of Aimee Semple McPherson, which is probably unfair to McPherson, who was certainly flamboyant and religiously extreme but politically fairly moderate.

The thing is, Telnaes did not make up some bizarre phrase to stick in Noem’s mouth: Rather, she used the journalist’s sneaky trick of quoting her directly and accurately. Kosplay Kristi was speaking of sending ICE to the Super Bowl, under the impression that a lot of lawn workers and motel maids will be shelling out six grand each to watch Bad Bunny.

I have the responsibility for making sure everybody goes to the Super Bowl, has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave, and that’s what America is about.

In case you wondered what America is about. It’s about going to the Super Bowl, enjoying it and then self-deporting. Or something.

You can’t copyright a book title, but I don’t think David Halberstam’s estate has to worry about anyone writing about this administration and calling it The Best and the Brightest.

It would all be hilarious if it weren’t so unspeakably, incredibly brutal and cruel. Part of the problem is that, while people being dragged out of their cars and beaten in the streets should be appalling, when seen on TV it seems to be happening to someone else, somewhere else.

I’ve seen a demonstrator hit in the face with billy clubs less than 10 feet from me, and it’s a whole lot different than seeing it on television. She was screaming in pain and fear and her face looked like bloody liver as they dragged her away, but I really think you had to be there, because three months later I watched the Chicago Convention on TV and it was the same town and the same cops, but it just felt like TV.

On the other hand, once budget cuts begin to double insurance premiums, and to simultaneously limit what financially-burdened hospitals are able to provide, the impact of a less physical, more organizational cruelty will hit more people more directly.

Unfortunately, the midterms are likely to be over before the worst of it has struck, which sounds heartless, but if it’s going to happen, it ought to at least have some strategic value.

One piece of cruelty that is beginning to hit a wide target is the flood of layoffs triggered by the shutdown. Trump once more proves that you can be clever without being intelligent, because he’s threatening to fire workers in revenge for the shutdown but had the good instinct to order the military paid, although they weren’t supposed to be.

The threats could bring a few legislators to heel, but there are lots of young families in the military and letting them starve or lose their housing would be directly felt.

“Crocodile tears” is a wonderfully well-chosen metaphor.

It’s odd to look back on Nixon nostalgically, but being on his enemies list was more of a compliment than a threat. It meant he didn’t like you. He might decide to have your phone tapped or order your taxes audited, but you didn’t have to worry about your family’s safety.

Those were the good old days.

The boy is still in custody, Lattarulo said.

The transfer occurred on the same day Judge Richard G. Stearns of the Boston federal court ordered the boy’s release by Tuesday unless ICE and the Department of Homeland Security could provide grounds for continued detention, according to court documents

ICE arrested the boy, whose family is from Brazil, after an interaction with the Everett Police Department, the Boston Globe reported.

The boy’s mother received a call on Thursday to pick her son up from the department; however, an hour and a half later, she was told ICE had taken her son, the Globe reported.

ICE and the Everett Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comments on Monday.

This is not the first time ICE has detained someone younger than 18 in Massachusetts.

In September, ICE detained a 16-year-old boy in Milford during a traffic stop.

The teenager’s attorney, Jill Seeber, previously told WHDH-TV in Boston that the teenager went to get a snack at a nearby bakery when he stopped to talk to somebody that he knew. ICE agents then detained him, according to Seeber.

The boy was released from detention and was taken home by agents.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin previously told MassLive that ICE had no idea that the teenager was a minor and that he was detained “to determine his identity and if he was a potential safety threat.”

“ICE does NOT target juveniles or children,” DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to MassLive. “At the time of the detainment, ICE had no knowledge of the individual’s age.”

Carballo said ICE officers broke the window of a Langley Park woman’s car with her teenage daughter inside.
Fearing persecution under a military government, he was able to get asylum in D.C. before coming to the Langley Park area.
“It was an onslaught, especially at Northwestern and High Point high schools” where many Langley Park teens attend.
“Then we had Purple Line construction, which took away business when it became too difficult to travel here.","Sit down in the San Alejo Salvadoran restaurant, near the corner of New Hampshire Avenue and University Boulevard in suburban Maryland, and you have entered the heart of Langley Park — like a mini Central America.

Situated on the border where Montgomery County ends and Prince George’s County begins, Langley Park’s mostly Latino community is proud of its 100-year history as a lively neighborhood of immigrants, filled with Hispanic markets, restaurants and small businesses that line its busy streets.

But challenges from landlord neglect and the impacts of the Maryland Transit Administration’s new Purple Line are making life more difficult for the residents who call Langley Park home. And more recently, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have put the community on edge.

National politics hit home

As she sat eating tamales at San Alejo, Maryland State Del. Deni Taveras talked about how the ICE raids in the neighborhood have also reopened old wounds.

“A lot of people here lived through wars in their countries. To have masked men with machine guns breaking down doors at 6 a.m., that brings trauma,” she said, referring to how ICE officers have been entering homes in Langley Park. “People are afraid to go to work. They’re afraid to make a living,” she said.

Lindolfo Carballo, senior director of community economic development of the Latino advocacy organization CASA, which is located in the center of Langley Park, agreed with Taveras. “What this administration is doing has horrified our community,” he said and added that he’s seen ICE officers pull people right off the street and social media posts have tracked the abuse in the neighborhood.

Carballo said ICE officers broke the window of a Langley Park woman’s car with her teenage daughter inside. “Her daughter saw the whole thing. And that’s not only illegal but it’s inhumane,” he said.

The reason for the targeting? About 85% of the neighborhood’s 22,000 residents are from Central America, and some are undocumented, Carballo said. The majority are from El Salvador and Guatemala, along with immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and other countries.

Thousands of Latino immigrants moved to Langley Park during the 1970s and 1980s, a time when civil wars were tearing through El Salvador and Guatemala, Carballo said. Now, the community has one of the highest populations of Salvadorans in the U.S.

Carballo himself is an immigrant who escaped El Salvador in the early 1980s after he was arrested for participating in anti-government activities during the nation’s civil war. Fearing persecution under a military government, he was able to get asylum in D.C. before coming to the Langley Park area. He is concerned that Central American immigrants now are being denied the opportunities he received.

Even before he came to work in Langley Park, the area was always a neighborhood of immigrants, Carballo said, stretching back to the 1920s when a British immigrant, Frederick McCormick-Goodhart bought the land where Langley Park now sits.

The mining magnate built a 30,000-square-foot mansion, where CASA is now headquartered. Developers built low-cost garden apartments surrounding the mansion, which attracted large groups of immigrants over the past 90 years, from Eastern European Jews to Africans to an influx of Central Americans starting in the 1970s.

Housing, economic strains and fentanyl

While ICE raids are the latest concern for Langley Park residents, the neighborhood has had some longstanding problems that leaders are still addressing.

Carballo said while immigrants were able to find cheaper housing in Langley Park, its housing stock has long suffered neglect. For years, landlords often deferred maintenance and faced few consequences because non-English speaking tenants didn’t have the tools to legally challenge them — leaving some occupants living in deteriorating buildings.

“Drive around here and you can see windows made of cardboard,” Carballo said. “And in the wintertime, that is cruel.”

About 20 years ago, with the help of CASA, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary next month, some tenants organized and fought to improve living conditions, which brought about upgrades in some buildings.

“This is a hardworking area of individuals that want to make their American dreams come true,” Taveras said. But now people are paying $1,700 a month for rent, which is very high for someone making just $15-$20 an hour, she said.

To make ends meet, many people rent out rooms or families double up so they can make rent, causing overcrowding in some buildings.

Taveras has represented different parts of Prince George’s County on the council for 12 years, and now represents Langley Park while living on the edge of the neighborhood. She came to the D.C. area from New York in the early 2000s.

Of Dominican heritage, she says she’s proud to fight for the neighborhood, a community grappling with the same housing and economic struggles she knew growing up as an orphan in one of New York’s Hispanic neighborhoods.

Adding to the economic strains, fentanyl is also eating away at the neighborhood, especially among young people, Taveras said. “It was an onslaught, especially at Northwestern and High Point high schools” where many Langley Park teens attend.

Over the past 10 years, however, “we’ve been able to address the addiction through Narcan,” she said. Legislation and distributing fentanyl detection strips have also helped “because a lot of people didn’t know that what they were taking was laced with fentanyl.”

The Purple Line — hopes and hazards

The Purple Line, MTA’s long-awaited 16-mile light rail stretching from Bethesda to New Carrollton, cuts directly through Langley Park.A 2017 report said few deny that the Purple Line will bring new amenities and services to what researchers referred to as a “long-neglected portion of the county.”

While many in Langley Park welcome better transit access, they also worry it will accelerate gentrification, Carballo said.

Construction of the line over the past seven years has cut into profits for businesses along the rail’s path, according to Yolanda Brewster, a Guatemalan immigrant who runs the Xelaju kiosk, which sells Guatemalan food, clothes and souvenirs in La Union Mall on University Boulevard.

“First we had the pandemic, which wiped us out,” she said. “Then we had Purple Line construction, which took away business when it became too difficult to travel here. Now it’s like a cemetery — no one comes here anymore.”

Culture helps build community

Despite these challenges, Langley Park endures as a place where families build futures. Carballo of CASA said that, to him, the neighborhood represents “everything positive.”

“It’s a very young neighborhood, right? There are so many kids here, so many people, and that is the future of the United States.”

Del. Taveras agrees on how deeply that spirit runs. “We have children here that are on their way to Dartmouth. We have families starting their businesses, that are extremely entrepreneurial.”

“We have a sense of resilience here, a sense of community here, a sense of culture that is extremely rich and very endearing,” Taveras said.

She said this is especially important to point out during Hispanic Heritage Month, when the U.S. celebrates all things Latino. She remembered celebrations past at Langley Park’s MegaMart Hispanic grocery store, which had a party for Guatemalian Independence Day on Oct. 15 last year that was “so big, it lasted until the next day.

“As somebody who could have lived anywhere, I chose to be here,” Taveras said, “and I’m so proud of where I live.”

What we know:

Thompson said the protests at the ICE facility ""degenerated into chaos,"" adding that 10 of those arrested were ""around the age of my own daughter.""

""As a mother and a mayor, I am mad at what happened,"" Thompson said in a statement. ""Broadview didn’t choose to have the ICE facility in our community. But it’s here. And so are Broadview residents.""

Under a new executive order signed by Thompson, demonstrations will now be limited to the safety zone located directly at the ICE facility on Beach Street. The previous protest area on South 25th Avenue between Lexington and Fillmore has been eliminated.

What they're saying:

Thompson said the decision was made in consultation with the Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

""It has been only God’s grace alone that a protester has not been struck and killed by a motorist on 25th Avenue given how frequently protesters dash onto this busy, four-lane street,"" Thompson said.

While reaffirming her support for peaceful demonstrations, Thompson condemned violent behavior at recent protests and said her top priority remains protecting residents and first responders.

""I respect, support, and defend the protesters’ free and – peaceful – speech against the outrageous injustices and deplorable unprovoked chemical arms attacks by ICE agents against American citizens, journalists, and ministers that put Broadview police and firefighters in harms’ way,"" she said.

Under the current framework, USCIS confirms that renewal applications for existing DACA recipients continue to be processed nationwide without interruption.
Advance Parole for international travel remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.
This acceptance without adjudication approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced it is accepting new DACA applications but cannot process or approve them due to ongoing court restrictions, creating a complex situation for potential applicants. This development comes amid continuous legal challenges to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides protection from deportation and work authorization for undocumented individuals who arrived in the United States as children.

The current status reflects the ongoing legal battle that has plagued DACA since its establishment in 2012. Recent court decisions, particularly from the Southern District of Texas under Judge Andrew Hanen and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, have determined that DACA was not lawfully implemented. In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit struck down key portions of the Biden Administration’s DACA regulation while stopping short of completely terminating the program, sending the case back to Judge Hanen for further determination.

Under the current framework, USCIS confirms that renewal applications for existing DACA recipients continue to be processed nationwide without interruption. However, initial applications from first-time applicants are being accepted but placed on indefinite hold. The agency will receive and store these filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction emerges. Advance Parole for international travel remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.

This acceptance without adjudication approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved regardless of application submission. The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security have requested that the court permit adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not face penalties due to a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.

Legal experts anticipate that regardless of the Texas court’s next decision, the case will likely return to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final determination on DACA’s future in 2026. The program continues to stand at the center of legal and political debate in the United States, with this latest development representing both a technical step and a potential turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding Dreamers’ protections.",https://www.citybuzz.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/favicon-65x65.png,N,,2025-10-13 12:58:08.114322

That trip was also the last time she hugged Villegas Gonzalez goodbye.","On a recent humid morning in Michoacán, Mexico, hundreds gathered to mourn Silverio Villegas Gonzalez. His body had finally come home after getting shot and killed by an ICE agent in Franklin Park after he allegedly tried to run him over.

The small town where he was born and raised was filled that late September day with neighbors, friends, and relatives, many of whom have family members working or living in the United States. Among them were Silverio’s elderly parents, dressed in white, leaning on others for support as they made their way through their town, paying homage to Villegas Gonzalez.

Their faces were etched with sorrow; their steps heavy not just from age, but from the weight of a grief that may never leave them. At 38 years old, he was the youngest of their 10 children.

“Mi hijo era un buen hombre. Por qué me lo mataron así?” cried Esperanza Gonzalez, 77, his mother, on a phone call with Tribune. “My son was a good man. Why did they kill him that way?”

On the day of his burial, as they lowered their son into the ground, one absence loomed larger than the rest: Villegas Gonzalez’s two children were not there.

Villegas Gonzalez was killed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 during what authorities initially described as a routine traffic stop that Villegas Gonzalez tried to flee. A few weeks later, the state of Idaho took custody of his two kids, according to his family and Mexican officials.

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not immediately provide a comment regarding the case, but his family said Villegas Gonzalez had been seeking custody of his two sons, 7 and 3, in court before his death and had obtained partial custody. Their biological mother had moved with the children to Idaho about three years ago, the family said.

“The (U.S.) government killed their father and now they want to take them away from us,” Graciela Villegas, one of his sisters, told the Tribune. “Those children adored their dad.”

Now, from across the border, his family is not only seeking to reunite with his children, they’re also fighting for something just as important, they said: justice.

Earlier this month, Illinois Democratic leaders, including U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García and other congressional representatives sent a letter to the Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asking for transparency and accountability about the fatal shooting by the ICE officer. Meanwhile, the Mexican Consulate in Chicago confirmed it is working to help reunite the children with their extended family who live in the United States.

Ambassador Reyna Torres Mendivil said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is demanding a “thorough investigation.”

In the weeks since Villegas Gonzalez’s death, new video evidence has emerged, including footage from witness cellphones and, most notably, body cameras worn by Franklin Park police officers who responded to the scene. Democratic leaders requesting the investigation say there are “inconsistencies between publicly released surveillance footage and allegations made by DHS,” which claimed that Villegas Gonzalez dragged an officer with his vehicle and attempted to run him over, causing serious injuries.

Back in Michoacán, the calls for justice can seem louder than the wailing at the burial. For Graciela Villegas, who had not seen her brother in nearly two decades, seeing her brother in a casket was “excruciating.”

Her brother, she said, was wrongfully portrayed as a criminal.

“They killed him for no reason,” Graciela said.

Though DHS said Villegas Gonzalez was a targeted undocumented immigrant because of his criminal background of “reckless driving,” the Tribune found no criminal history for Villegas Gonzalez, who had been living in the Chicago area for the past 18 years.

Since getting his children, Villegas Gonzalez dedicated his time to work and taking care of his two sons, his loved ones say. He was working on getting healthier and on saving money, his sister said.

“That’s because he wanted to prove that he could be a good father to gain full custody of his children,” she added.

She thinks that her brother was “so worried of losing his children” and “that’s why he may have tried to run away” from the federal agents who were questioning him.

Penny Kostoglakis, the mother of the children and Villegas Gonzalez’s wife, said she has not been able to see her children since the state of Idaho picked them up from Chicago. Though she lives in that state and intends to seek custody, she said she thinks her children will be well taken care of by the Villegas family if they stay in the United States.

“He was always good to me,” she said about Villegas Gonzalez. “He was always working and I would stay home to take care of the kids.”

When she found out about the shooting she immediately asked her sister in Chicago, “Were the kids with him?”

Villegas Gonzalez had just dropped off his kids at day care and was on his way to work when the agents approached him. Mexican officials say they are monitoring the welfare of the children.

“We are doing everything necessary, in coordination with the consular network, to ensure that these children are being taken care of now,” Torres Mendivil said. “(The custody of the children) will not be determined by the family or the consulates. No one else will intervene other than a judge who must assess whether the children are being placed in a safe environment.”

Graciela Villegas remembers her brother as a quiet and reserved man who left his rural hometown in Mexico to pursue opportunities to earn more money in the United States when he was 20 years old.

That was the last time Graciela saw her brother alive.

“But he would call or message me almost every day,” she said through tears. “Whenever he could, he would send us money, especially since our parents have been sick lately.”

The family lives in Loma de Chupio, a small town with dirt roads and houses made of stone with tiled roofs. The community lives off the land, raising cattle and relying on what they can grow.

Most people in their town have family members living in the United States without legal status, Villegas said. Many of them knew him personally.

“The whole town is grieving, and everyone is scared of what might happen to their loved ones in the U.S.,” said Lourdes Alejandra Lopez, director of migrant services in Irimbo, Michoacán, the municipality that includes Loma de Chupio. Lopez has been supporting the Villegas family through the repatriation process, the burial, and now serves as their liaison as Mexican authorities demand an investigation into the fatal shooting.

Local officials have also started compiling information on residents with family members abroad, aiming to provide resources and guidance in case of deportation for when they return.

“For now, the family needs to rest,” Lopez said. “They are facing not only the pain of losing a loved one but also the burden of a legal battle.”

For Esperanza Gonzalez, the only comfort amid the grief would be having her two grandchildren, Villegas Gonzalez’s sons, back home with them.

She met her eldest grandson during a visit to Chicago a few years ago.

Spencer-Antoine, Jai Dulani, Amy Goodman, Aallyah Wright, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/native-survival-depends-on-protecting-both-tribal-and-us-citizenship-rights/,"The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 extended U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans without requiring them to sever their tribal affiliations, as was previously necessary.
Contemporary Threats to Citizenship and Sovereignty The Trump administration’s attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are not isolated incidents.
They are part of a consistent effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations and the people who belong to them.
The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.
Indigenous Peoples’ Day as Resistance In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty.","Indigenous Peoples’ Day has always been an act of celebration, resistance, and truth. When we gather and organize for Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we affirm that we are still here. It is a reminder that our stories did not begin with Columbus, and they do not end with the myth of American exceptionalism and conquest. But today, it carries an urgency we can’t ignore. In the current political climate, that affirmation takes on new meaning as questions about the legitimacy of our U.S. citizenship are raised in efforts to end birthright citizenship and erase the political existence of Native nations.

On October 9, 2025, Trump issued the 2025 Columbus Day Proclamation, declaring Christopher Columbus “a visionary who paved the way for the founding of our great Nation.” He urged Americans to honor “the values of courage, faith, and discovery that built Western civilization.”

In the proclamation, Trump made no mention of Indigenous people, unless you count the mention of a “vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage.” The wording of Trump’s phrase echoes a similar line in the Declaration of Independence, which accuses King George III of acting against the colonists who opposed British rule by colluding with “the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.” Instead of taking the opportunity to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples’ Day, Trump doubled down on a myth of discovery that glorifies genocide and rebrands colonization as destiny.

This same worldview underpins Trump’s renewed effort to end birthright citizenship, a move that threatens not only immigrants but also the very foundation of Native existence. In one of the administration’s own legal arguments, officials claimed, “The United States’ connection with the children of illegal aliens and temporary visitors is weaker than its connection with members of Indian tribes. If the latter link is insufficient for birthright citizenship, the former certainly is.”

This suggests that tribal citizenship, the political relationship that predates the United States itself, is somehow incompatible with being American. It echoes the logic used to justify centuries of termination policies, removal, and forced dependency.

The Trump administration’s attacks on birthright citizenship do not just threaten immigrant communities. They strike at the very heart of Indigenous sovereignty. They threaten to bring back an era of termination and removal, creating the conditions for Native people to once again be treated as wards of the state, stripped of rights, and relocated to lands or countries we have never set foot in.

Recent reports from the Oregon Capital Chronicle describe how Navajo citizens were detained in immigration sweeps across border states, raising alarm among tribal leaders who warn that racial profiling and the refusal to recognize tribal identification put Indigenous people in the same danger as undocumented immigrants.

The American Immigration Council has also warned that the Supreme Court’s refusal to restrict racial profiling in immigration raids has encouraged law enforcement to target anyone who looks “foreign,” a pattern that puts Indigenous people at particular risk because our identities and documents are not consistently recognized or treated as valid government documents.

Tribal Nations have alerted their citizens to this threat, suggesting they carry their tribal IDs, Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), passports, and other photo IDs to help reduce the risk of detainment in the event of ICE raids.

The Indian Law Resource Center also reminds us that many of those being deported are Indigenous people themselves. The center has raised concern over the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous and have rights under both U.S. and international law.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence — and an assertion that, despite these threats, we will not be erased, silenced, or eradicated.

Sovereignty and Citizenship

Indigenous Peoples’ Day stands in defiance of a nation that has always treated Native sovereignty as an obstacle to overcome in upholding the myth of Manifest Destiny. In 1871, theIndian Appropriations Act ended the recognition of tribes as sovereign nations. With that single act, Congress declared that no tribe would be acknowledged as an independent power capable of making treaties. Our nations were reduced to wards of the state, entirely dependent on the same government that had stolen our lands.

TheDawes Act of 1887 went further. It divided tribal lands into individual allotments and stripped millions of acres from Native control. It was designed to assimilate Natives into mainstream society and dismantle tribal sovereignty, breaking apart communities and leaving many Natives impoverished and landless. The act also tied land allotments to U.S. citizenship, granting it to those who accepted allotments, severed their tribal affiliations, and left reservations, making citizenship a tool of assimilation rather than recognition of rights.

With the 1934 passage of theIndian Reorganization Act, also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, tribes regained a measure of sovereignty. The Indian Reorganization Act allowed tribes to re-establish governments and manage their own lands, but the recognition came with heavy federal oversight. Yet even within those restrictions, our nations rebuilt and strengthened the scope and boundaries of our sovereignty.

Dual Citizenship

As Native peoples, we are citizens of the United States, but we are also citizens of our tribal nations. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 extended U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans without requiring them to sever their tribal affiliations, as was previously necessary. The Act created a dual framework, where we not only have the right to self-determination but also hold rights and responsibilities in two nations simultaneously.

This reality is fragile, and not all Native nations share the same protection. As Teen Vogue reported, nearly 400 tribes in the United States lack federal recognition, which means they do not share the same nation-to-nation relationship that federally recognized tribes have with the U.S. government. This also leaves their people without the legal rights, resources, or protections guaranteed to federally recognized tribes. For these communities, the lack of recognition means they exist in a legal limbo when federal policy turns hostile.

As Dina Gilio-Whitaker, author and professor of American Indian studies and lecturer at the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center, explained to Truthout:

Tribal sovereignty as a legal principle and self-determination as tribal autonomy has always been what’s at stake for tribal nations. Throughout U.S. history it has never been unassailable in U.S. law because of underlying logics of Euro-Christian superiority; that is what the doctrine of discovery is.

History has shown that while our sovereignty is an organic, inalienable right, it is not a fixed or guaranteed right in relation to the U.S. government. Indigenous nations must continually nurture the nation-to-nation relationship that we have and defend our sovereignty against political systems designed to limit or erase it.

If tribal sovereignty were ever dissolved as it was in 1871 with the Indian Appropriations Act, recognition of our tribal citizenship would disappear with it. If our U.S. citizenship were also revoked, we would be left stateless in our own homelands. That is the depth of what is at stake when sovereignty is undermined. Native identity, rights, and futures are tied to the recognition of both forms of citizenship, to the survival of our nations as sovereign powers, and to the protection of the land and water that sustain us.

Contemporary Threats to Citizenship and Sovereignty

The Trump administration’s attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are not isolated incidents. They are part of a consistent effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations and the people who belong to them. Treaty obligations are dismissed whenever they conflict with corporate interests. Sacred lands such asBears Ears andOak Flat are stripped of federal protection and opened to mining and drilling.Pipelines are forced through Native territories without consultation or consent. Federal funding for housing, health care, and education — already limited in many communities — is repeatedly threatened, further weakening the foundations of Native life.

Native children face a direct threat to their connection to their nations through attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, which has been challenged in multiple cases in state and federal courts. Native tribes and organizations successfully defended and even expanded this law.

Passed in 1978 to stop the mass removal of Native children from their families and communities, the Indian Child Welfare Act protects the right of children to remain with their families, in their communities, and connected to their cultures.

Despite ongoing challenges, the law remains one of the most important protections for tribal sovereignty and Native families. In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act’s constitutionality in a 7–2 decision in Haaland v. Brackeen, rejecting all challenges to the law.

More recently, in August 2024, the California Supreme Court strengthened the Indian Child Welfare Act by requiring child welfare agencies to investigate a child’s potential Native ancestry before separating families. But around the same time, the rejection of the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act denied survivors of cultural genocide a path to justice. The proposed commission would have investigated the legacy of Indian boarding schools and given survivors a chance to tell their stories and seek accountability.

Attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, birthright citizenship, and tribal sovereignty are interconnected. Each is a threat to the dual citizenship Native people hold. Undermining either form of citizenship puts Native people at risk of legal limbo, statelessness, and social and economic marginalization. The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Refusing to Surrender

Despite continued threats to our sovereignty, Native nations, communities, and organizations use every means available, from the courts to direct action, to defend our rights and existence. The victories won and even the losses show that even in the face of systemic erasure and violence, Native people refuse to disappear, refuse to surrender.

The fight to protect Oak Flat in Arizona is a current example of this. Oak Flat, a sacred Apache site, is threatened by a copper mine authorized through a congressional land swap pushed by the Trump administration. Tribal leaders, activists, and allies organized to defend Oak Flat, arguing in court and mobilizing to ensure that sacred land is not exchanged and destroyed for foreign private profit.

As of October 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear further appeals, supporting lower court rulings that allow the transfer to proceed. However, a federal appeals court issued an emergency injunction blocking the transfer and delaying the mine’s advance while legal challenges are considered.

At Standing Rock, hundreds of tribes and tens of thousands of allies gathered and occupied land near the Cannonball River in North Dakota to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline to protect treaty lands and water. Although the pipeline was completed, the resistance led to widespread awareness of Indigenous rights and environmental justice.

Standing Rock sparked solidarity actions around the world, inspired divestment campaigns targeting banks that financed the pipeline, and brought issues such as broken treaties, environmental racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women into global conversations. It also resulted in ongoing legal challenges and inspired a new generation of Native activists who understand that sovereignty is not negotiable.

These interventions, whether through the courts or activism, are not symbolic but the literal defense of rights that are supposed to be guaranteed under tribal and U.S. law. It is the refusal to accept marginalization, neglect, erasure, and defeat. Indigenous Peoples’ Day is both a reflection of these struggles and a call to continue the fight.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day as Resistance

In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty. When birthright citizenship is questioned, when sacred lands are desecrated, when funding for essential programs is threatened, and when cultural institutions are ignored or attacked, the very survival of our communities is at stake.

In an interview with Truthout, Dina Gilio-Whitaker explained:

Tribes will always be a threat to a certain segment of the American population (currently coded as Republican) because the doctrine of tribal sovereignty erects a system of guardrails to protect the rights that hundreds of treaties guaranteed, and the small amount of land that tribes still control. Those lands hold coveted resources that tribes have the power to choose to develop or keep in the ground.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day calls on everyone to honor our survival and acknowledge the ongoing struggle against colonization and genocide. Our struggles are not isolated; they echo in other parts of the world, from the defense of our homelands here to the fight for survival in Gaza, where people continue to resist displacement and violence. It is a reminder that what happens to Native nations today is a glimpse of what can happen to any community when power goes unchecked and rights are violated. Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds us that defending our sovereignty is defending justice for all.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2220129370-1536x1025.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 10:57:17.820348

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants—regardless of status—have been pulling back.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64.
""Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what's happening to immigrants,"" she said.
""I can't express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,"" Durazo said.","An estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are in the country legally but are not citizens stand to lose their government-subsidized health care coverage under the sweeping tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.

But seven states—California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington—plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.

The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

""We're taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,"" said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

""And the result will be that our health—individually, as families and as communities—will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,"" Broder said.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants—regardless of status—have been pulling back.

To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.

Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.

New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.

""States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,"" said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants' access to health care. ""But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.""

Making it less attractive to stay

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump's larger anti-immigration stance and ""Congress' interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.""

""It's a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?"" Vaughan said. ""They're trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.""

As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is ""likely to increase,"" Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.

""However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,"" Pillai said. ""So it's almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.""

Makhlouf said the Trump administration's policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.

""Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what's happening to immigrants,"" she said. ""When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people's humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ""You don't deserve access to health care,"" then that can be turned on to any group.""

Under Trump's domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom's office.

On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state's decision to deny coverage to immigrants.

""I can't express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,"" Durazo said. ""Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.""

Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.

""We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,"" McGuire said during the debate. ""So we've had to make some tough decisions. I know we're not going to please everyone.""

Obligated in New York

One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost—90%—of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.

Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump's law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state's Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.

""These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York's delivery system,"" Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.

""People have taken root here, they have families here now"" and federal agents ""basically just stripped them from their life.","One minute Maria was selling tamales from her food cart in Chicago's West Side. The next, her son said, she was bundled into a van, the latest victim of U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigrants.

Maria's family was left to pick up the pieces, removing her cart, food containers and umbrella before launching a frantic search for the Mexican-born mother of seven who has lived in the United States for two decades, albeit undocumented.

By Saturday morning, 24 hours after her arrest, her family had still learned ""nothing"" about her status from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency conducting aggressive raids in and around the nation's third largest city.

""It could be days, it could be months, it could be years, or we may never see her again,"" Eduardo Santoyo, 22, said of his mother.

Maria's detention in broad daylight — witnesses posted video online — fit a recent pattern: Agents swoop in without warning, snatch an unsuspecting resident and drive off, with relatives left to panic over the fate of their loved ones.

""What are we going to tell my sister?"" Santayo asked, referring to his mother's youngest child, who is only six years old.

Anguish colored the faces of Maria's son and another daughter, age 16, as they stepped in to continue running the tamale cart in the very spot where their mother was taken into custody.

This week saw scores of immigration detentions in Chicago, many of which only came to light after witnesses posted footage of the arrests on social media.

Alerts about raids are popping up regularly online as activist groups warn residents about sweeps in neighborhoods with a large Latino population like Cicero, Little Village and Pilsen.

Migrants reportedly have been detained at Chicago-area construction sites, near a university building, along strip malls and outside schools.

A local television producer, who holds U.S. citizenship, was arrested by federal agents during immigration enforcement operations on Chicago's North Side, her employer WGN said. She was later released.

Federal agents also targeted rideshare drivers in a sweep Friday at O'Hare International Airport, resulting in 12 arrests, according to local reports.

While protesters have been beaten, tear-gassed and arrested in recent weeks at an ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, anti-immigration unrest across the rest of the city has been sporadic.

But the impact of the raids has been nothing less than chilling.

""You may not see a raid, but this is affecting our community,"" said Casey Caballero, 37, a self-described soccer mom from Lombard who is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Caballero and others accuse immigration agents of discriminatory racial profiling.

Santoyo has U.S. citizenship, but expressed anger and fear that such status may matter little if agents are doing what he suspects: targeting people because of the color of their skin and the language they speak.

""That's racism,"" he said. ""If they come after me, I have papers, but how would they know that?""

Another tamale street vendor not far from Maria's cart said she had heard of her detention and quickly teared up over what happened.

""It could be anyone"" swept up in the raids, she said.

A heavily tattooed man, who said he was driving past when Maria was taken into custody, expressed outrage at the operation, noting she had been serving food to the community for years.

Nae Campbell, a longtime customer, recalled how this ""good woman"" could be found vending year-round, whether in searing heat or Chicago's famously bitter cold.

As for the raids, Campbell called them ""the most ... inhumane gesture I've ever seen.""

""People have taken root here, they have families here now"" and federal agents ""basically just stripped them from their life. That's crazy,"" the 32-year-old hospital worker said.

But Campbell, who drove across the city for Maria's goods, said she had faith that the vendor's family would be supported.

Doctors at Adventist Health White Memorial hospital in Boyle Heights told LAist that hospital administrators are allowing federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist. Hospital leaders also have told doctors to allow immigration agents to remain by a detained patient’s side, even during consultations, inhibiting frank discussions between doctors and their patients and potentially violating patient privacy laws. Doctors say this is not typical protocol for any patients, including those brought in by local police or sheriff’s deputies.

These doctors are equally concerned about their inability to ensure follow-up care for patients released to the ICE processing facility known as B-18 in downtown L.A., where critics say some detainees have been held for days on end with no proper beds or medical care.

Why this matters

White Memorial is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The hospital has been operating for more than 110 years. Its calling is to “help improve the lives of our friends and neighbors in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights,” according to its website.

Five physicians at White Memorial shared the details with LAist about ICE’s presence at the hospital and hospital administrators’ response on the condition that they not be named for fear of retaliation from their employer or from immigration authorities. LAist reviewed internal emails supporting their claims.

“We have an ethical and moral duty to provide excellent medical care and to serve the patient’s interest,” one doctor at White Memorial told LAist. But the doctor said the frequent presence of masked, armed immigration agents in the hospital makes it “very difficult to do that.”

The physicians told LAist they believe the directives from their bosses conflict with the responsibilities all doctors have to their patients and with guidance from the California attorney general.

White Memorial did not respond to a request for an interview from LAist or to our emailed list of questions.

In a statement, a White Memorial spokesperson said the hospital’s staff “are passionately committed to providing the highest standard of medical care to all who come through our doors, regardless of their circumstances” and that the hospital has “protocols in place that are designed to help support the lawful respect of patient rights.”

“We are doing everything in our power to provide safe and compassionate care to our community during this time of unrest,” the statement reads. It also urged people not to “delay the medical care you need.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to specific questions from LAist or agree to an interview.

In a statement, she wrote that “ICE is not denying any illegal alien access to proper medical care or medications.” McLaughlin said it was “longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

She added that she hoped LAist “would consider NOT writing this garbage” in the wake of the recent shooting outside an ICE detention center in Texas, where one detainee was killed and two injured.

“These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” she wrote.

An analysis of federal court filings for assault on a federal officer by Colorado Public Radio shows a sharp increase in charges in recent months. The data is far short of the scale suggested by officials.

The bigger picture

A version of the conflicts described at White Memorial is happening across the state and the country as hospitals are forced to contend with fallout from the Trump administration’s mass deportation program. Caught in the middle are doctors and other medical professionals who have a legal duty to provide medical care to patients and ethical concerns about policies they feel affect the traditional standards of care.

The five doctors who spoke with LAist say the conflicts are especially acute at White Memorial, a hospital whose patient and surrounding population is mostly Latino and where several doctors told LAist they’re seeing two to three detained patients per shift.

The situation also raises questions about medical privacy at a time when the federal government is seeking access to sensitive personal information, including medical information from both immigrants and U.S.-born citizens.

Lorenzo Antonio González is a physician who volunteers with Unión del Barrio, which patrols Boyle Heights and other neighborhoods to warn people about ICE raids. He does not work at White Memorial but is aware of the doctors’ concerns. He said he fears ICE’s frequent presence at the hospital will further the chilling effect already causing many Boyle Heights neighbors — where more than 80% of households speak Spanish and a quarter of residents are noncitizens — to forgo medical care and avoid leaving their homes. González called White Memorial’s alleged behavior “an erosion of trust within this pillar of a community.”

How we got here

As immigration raids ramped up in Los Angeles this year, some detainees have needed urgent medical care, either because they were injured while being detained, had a pre-existing illness, or because they became ill while being held at the downtown immigration facility.

Some of these incidents became headlines. In July, a Salvadoran woman was brought to Glendale Memorial Hospital with injuries suffered during a raid. In that case, camera crews descended on the hospital as activists protested the presence of ICE agents in the public lobby.

Meanwhile, White Memorial stayed out of the news. In June, a hospital leader sent an email to colleagues, flagging several incidents involving immigration detainees, including one in which agents remained in the room with a detained patient during the patient’s entire stay at the hospital. The email also noted that agents told doctors they could not call the patient’s family members when the patient couldn’t remember her medications, according to the email and doctors who spoke with LAist.

Doctors at White Memorial and other hospitals told LAist it’s not typical for law enforcement officers to remain in the room during patient care, even with criminal detainees, unless there’s a serious security risk. People in ICE custody are civil, not criminal detainees. Doctors also told LAist it’s common practice to call family members, with a patient’s permission, to inquire about their medical history and current medications.

So the doctors at White Memorial pressed hospital administrators for a clear policy and legal guidance on how to balance ICE agent demands with the hospital’s responsibilities for patient care.

The answer that came back from hospital administrators: defer to the agents.

Hospital leaders told doctors — both verbally, doctors say, and in writing in several emails reviewed by LAist — that immigration agents are allowed to be present at all times, even during discussions about a patient’s sensitive medical information. Doctors also were told they could not call a detained patient’s family member without an agent’s permission. In one email to subordinates, a hospital leader told White Memorial staff that doing so could be a “security risk.”

“That’s like encouraging medical negligence,” one White Memorial doctor told LAist in response to this guidance.

At least one doctor told LAist they are defying hospital leaders’ guidance, deferring instead to their medical duty to the patient and to follow medical privacy laws.

“There’s no way you can get me to not call a patient’s family if they’re hurt and need support,” the doctor said.

Why detainee care is under scrutiny

The concerns about White Memorial come at a time when the care of people in ICE custody is under scrutiny. In August, a man was severely injured while being detained at a car wash in Carson. Agents brought him to Harbor-UCLA medical center for treatment and remained by his bed, to which the man was cuffed, for over a month, according to a recent court ruling. He was never charged with violating any immigration laws, and in October, a federal judge ordered the agents monitoring him to leave the man’s hospital room and remove restrictions on the man’s “ability to make telephone calls to family and friends and to confer confidentially with counsel outside the presence of ICE agents.”Concerns about the medical care of detainees also extends to formal ICE detention centers. In September, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Westminster man who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, became the 17th person to die in ICE custody this year. Last year, 12 people died in ICE custody, according to agency statistics.

Ayala-Uribe, 39, was a former DACA recipient who supporters say had lived in the country since he was 4 years old. He was picked up in an ICE raid in Fountain Valley in August and sent to Adelanto. From there, a medical provider at the detention facility sent Ayala-Uribe to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an abscess, scheduled for surgery and sent back to the facility. He died in custody the following day.

Earlier this year, as immigration raids ramped up, the advocacy group Disability Rights California interviewed 18 people detained at the Adelanto ICE facility. In a subsequent report, the group concluded that “due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated.” The report claimed detainees faced “inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.”

In response to LAist’s emailed questions about medical care for ICE detainees, McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, said detainees received “medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare … many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she wrote.

McLaughlin did not respond to LAist’s follow-up email asking her to specifically respond to questions about hospital care for detainees outside of detention centers or to questions about the availability of health care at the B-18 processing center, which unlike the Adelanto facility, is not an official detention center.

In a recent, ongoing lawsuit over the L.A. immigration raids, the ACLU and other groups called out alleged unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical care at B-18.

“Individuals with conditions that require consistent medications and treatment are not given any medical attention, even when that information is brought to the attention of the officers on duty,” reads the initial complaint, filed in July.

One doctor at White Memorial told LAist she had called ICE supervisors at the holding center on several occasions to inquire about follow-up care for patients and was told there were no doctors at the facility and there was no way to obtain medication.

What this all means for detainees — and doctors

Other groups have tried to bring attention to the problems associated with immigration agents in hospital settings. The Committee of Interns and Residents, which is is part of the Service Employees International Union, publicly denounced the presence of ICE agents at University of California hospitals in July, saying it creates “an unsafe environment that … directly contradicts our mission to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare to every member of our community.”

Mahima Iyengar, a doctor at L.A. General hospital and secretary-treasurer of the committee, told LAist that having a law enforcement officer present during doctor-patient conversations can compromise care.

“There’s that level of trust that people have with their doctor that they don’t necessarily have when somebody else is listening,” Iyengar told LAist. “Your doctor is then not getting as much information as they need, and that information … very well could be what helps them come up with a diagnosis or what helps them decide what treatment [the patient] is going to be on.”

Iyengar said doctors also are unlikely to feel comfortable asking a patient important non-medical questions when an ICE agent is present.

“A lot of what determines our patients’ health are all of these social determinants, like where they’re living, how they’re getting to the hospital, if they have money, if they have kids that need childcare right now while they’re hospitalized,” she said. “All of those questions are important questions to ask that I would not personally feel comfortable asking if an officer was standing right there.”

McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to LAist’s specific questions about whether the agency recognizes detained patients’ privacy rights at hospitals.

What do legal experts say?

Last December, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued “guidance and model policies” for health care facilities in responding to the anticipated increase in immigration enforcement. The guidance is not mandatory for private hospitals, like White Memorial, but all health care facilities were “encouraged to adopt” model policies. Doctors who spoke with LAist said they had read the guidance and felt beholden to it.

The document states that:

State and federal medical privacy laws apply to all patients “regardless of immigration status.”

Health care facility staff “should identify circumstances in which granting immigration enforcement officers access to patients may interfere with physicians’ duty to provide competent medical care, to safeguard patient confidences and privacy, and to otherwise prioritize their obligations to their patients”; and

Facilities “should educate patients about their privacy rights and reassure them that their healthcare information is protected by federal and state laws.”

A spokesperson for Bonta told LAist the attorney general could not comment on whether the office had received complaints about ICE privacy breaches in health care settings because they are confidential.

“We continue to monitor compliance with all state and federal laws,” the spokesperson said in an email.

LAist also asked two health care legal experts about White Memorial’s direction to staff to allow ICE agents to be present during patient exams and bar calls to detained patients’ family members. Both said the guidance could violate medical privacy laws and ethical standards.

“From a patient safety perspective, it certainly raises red flags,” said Paul Schmeltzer, an L.A.-based health care and data privacy lawyer, referring especially to the prohibition on calling a detained patient’s family member. Schmeltzer also said letting an ICE agent remain next to a patient throughout their hospital stay without the patient’s consent is likely illegal. Patient privacy is protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Both generally prohibit doctors and hospitals from disclosing a patient’s medical information without their permission or a search warrant or other court order.

Schmeltzer said he saw “no permissible situation” under these laws for “disclosing” a detained patient’s hospital treatment to an ICE agent.

“The fact that an ICE agent is present in the room while this patient is receiving treatment, that’s a disclosure,” he said.

Deven McGraw, chief regulatory and privacy officer for the company Citizen Health, a patient data platform, agreed.

“ You’re basically saying, ‘Yeah, patient, you don’t have a choice but to disclose your medical information to this law enforcement official,’” she said.

McGraw was in charge of enforcing HIPAA at the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights from 2015 to 2017. She said there are personal and public health reasons for shielding a patient’s medical information from law enforcement. For example, a patient might hide that they have a communicable disease out of fear they’ll be targeted or isolated.

“ We’re supposed to treat people,” McGraw said. “The failure to treat them has potential consequences for their own health, plus the health of others.”

Schmeltzer and McGraw both said the administration at White Memorial might be making a calculated decision when weighing the hospital’s potential liability for violating the privacy rights of immigration detainees versus angering the Trump administration. Only the federal government and state attorneys general can prosecute a hospital for violating HIPAA, Schmeltzer and McGraw noted.

Some of the behavior described by doctors could be prohibited under a new state law, enacted in September as an “urgency” measure. The law requires health care facilities to ban immigration agents from entering non-public areas without a valid warrant and to advise staff on how to respond to agents’ requests for entry.

Even before the law, groups like the Committee of Interns and Residents had begun to train colleagues on the privacy rights of detained patients and how to handle ICE agents. Iyengar said doctors at L.A. General, for example, distribute “Know Your Rights” cards to immigrant patients and hospital employees are instructed to immediately call hospital directors if immigration agents appear.

“ Even just if there is an ICE officer in the hospital, that will put people off from visiting a loved one, or if word gets out, the community finds out, and they don’t want come to that hospital,” she said. “So, it’s just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that’s serving mostly immigrants.”

Bradford Exchange, Ltd., the Ninth Circuit addressed a plaintiff's attempt to sidestep the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) by structuring a complaint to avoid federal jurisdiction. The decision confirms that defendants can keep such cases in federal court by expressly waiving the ""adequate remedy at law"" objection that might otherwise deprive the court of equitable jurisdiction.

Plaintiff's Strategy: Equitable Remedies Only

The plaintiff filed a putative class action in California state court alleging that the defendant failed to disclose that his product purchase was part of a subscription program. Instead of seeking damages, the plaintiff sought only equitable restitution under California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and False Advertising Law (FAL).

The plaintiff admitted that he could have pursued damages under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), a legal remedy, but elected not to do so. His omission was deliberate. By limiting his complaint to equitable relief, the plaintiff sought to avoid removal by arguing that federal courts lack equitable jurisdiction when a plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.

Initially, the plaintiff's strategy worked. The district court granted plaintiff's motion to remand on the grounds that the court lacked equitable jurisdiction. Notably, the district court held that the defendant could not waive this ""jurisdictional"" defect.

The Ninth Circuit: Waiver Saves Federal Jurisdiction

The Ninth Circuit reversed. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed that, while federal courts lack ""equitable jurisdiction"" where a plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, the defendant may waive that defect. Specifically, the Court held ""district courts are empowered to remand a removed case to state court for lack of equitable jurisdiction, but only after the removing defendant is given the opportunity to waive the adequate-remedy-at-law issue to keep the case in federal court."" The Court described the impact of its holding plainly: ""if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in state court seeking only equitable relief and the case is properly removed to federal court, a defendant can defeat remand on equitable jurisdiction grounds by waiving the adequate-remedy-at-law issue.""

Practical Implications

The Ninth Circuit's ruling provides defendants with a new mechanism to defeat anti-removal tactics increasingly seen in California consumer class actions. While plaintiffs may continue to tailor complaints to seek only equitable restitution under the UCL and FAL, defendants can now neutralize that strategy and stay in federal court by waiving the argument that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law, ensuring that CAFA's jurisdiction reach remains intact.

In UK News:

The number of hate crimes committed in England and Wales has risen since the previous year, according to statistics released by the Home Office. In the year ending March 2025, 115,990 hate crimes were recorded by the police: this marks a 2% increase overall, a 6% increase in race hate crimes, and a 3% increase in religious hate crimes. A 19% increase in religious hate crimes targeting Muslims coincided with the time of the Southport murders and the subsequent race riots across the country.

Kemi Badenoch has confirmed at the Conservative Party Conference that her party would withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights and repeal the Human Rights Act if they form the next Government. This follows a legal review by the Shadow Attorney General, Lord Wolfson, into the impact of remaining in the ECHR. The Wolfson Report concluded that ‘it is hard to overstate the impact the ECHR has had on government decisions’, placing ‘substantial’ limitations on government policies to do with immigration, veterans’ rights, benefits, and reforms to sentencing and protest laws. Read Rosalind English’s summary of the Report here: The UK can, and should leave the Human Rights Convention (7 October 2025).

In International News:

A ceasefire has been agreed for the war in Gaza. The deal, brokered by the US, provides for a cessation in the conflict between Israel and Hamas which has been ongoing since 2023. The full text of the deal — entitled ‘Implementation steps for President Trump’s proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War’ — has not been publicised, though parts have been published by Israeli media. Trump’s 20-point plan, announced last week, provided for Gaza to be a ‘deradicalised terror-free zone’ which will be ‘redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza’; all hostages will be released, and full aid will be sent to the Gaza Strip.

In the Courts:

An asylum seeker unsuccessfully challenged the housing and financial support given to him by Enfield Council. In R (on the application of BLV) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWHC 2516 (Admin), the Claimant was a disabled man suffering from deafness, impaired eyesight, and major depressive and anxiety disorders. The Defendant was obliged, under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to provide ‘adequate’ accommodation and other ‘essentially living needs’ to the Claimant; under the Equality Act 2010 and Human Rights Act 1998, it was also bound to adjust its general approach to providing support under the IAA 1999 to account for the Claimant’s specific disabilities. The Defendant contended that Enfield’s support was inadequate for two reasons:

His accommodation was inadequate, because it was too far away from his support network and did not have a suitable disabled lift;

His internet access was inadequate, because it was not sufficient for him to access mental health and other support services via video-call (his deafness made it impossible to rely on voice call alone).

The court applied the ‘twin-track’ test, namely: 1) whether the Secretary of State met an objective ‘minimum standard’ for ‘ensur[ing] full respect for human dignity and a dignified standard of living, maintain[ing] an adequate standard of health and meet[ing] the subsistence needs of the asylum seeker’; 2) even if the minimum standard has been met, whether the Secretary of State complied with public law standards including rationality. The court found that (stage 1) the Claimant’s accommodation did meet the minimum standard. Furthermore, (stage 2) the Defendant’s treatment of the Claimant did not violate its duties under the EA 2010, HRA 1998, or other public law principles.

An interesting aspect of this case was that internet video calling was deemed capable of being an ‘essential living need’ because of the Claimant’s disabilities. The court ruled that ‘the concept of ‘need’ is…affected by technological progress and consequent changes in societal expectations’, and that ‘internet-based communication… has become essential for interacting with other people and accessing public services.’",https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.png,N,,2025-10-13 10:57:29.726233

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — HOSTAGE AND PRISONER RELEASES

All 20 of the remaining living hostages in Gaza have returned to Israel this morning. They have been brought to the Re’im military facility in southern Israel to undergo initial medical screenings. Oren Liebermann reports for CNN.

Buses carrying Palestinian prisoners released by Israel arrived in Ramallah in the West Bank today. These are the first of nearly 2,000 detained Palestinians expected to be freed in the coming hours. David M. Halbfinger, Aaron Boxerman, Natan Odenheimer, Isabel Kershner, Adam Rasgon, and David E. Sanger report for the New York Times.

Israel has not included Marwan Barghouti, a popular and potentially unifying Palestinian leader, in the list of around 250 prisoners to be released from Israel. Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk told Al Jazeera that the group that Hamas insists on the release of Barghouti, and other figures, and that it was in discussion with mediators. Lee Keath, Julia Frankel, and Jalal Bwaital report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

The first aid trucks since the ceasefire began arrived in Gaza yesterday. A spokesperson for the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that supplies of cooking gas had entered Gaza for the first time since March. The easing of restrictions has allowed the agency to deliver medical and emergency supplies where they are most needed, OCHA added. BBC News reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not travel to Egypt today for a summit on ending the war in Gaza due to the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, according to a statement from his office. This statement came following an announcement by Egypt’s presidency and a White House official that Netanyahu would be attending. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will be attending the summit. Wafaa Shurafa, Samy Magdy, and Melanie Lidman report for AP News; Eyad Kourdi, Kevin Liptak, Tal Shalev, and Kaitlan Collins report for CNN.

“Only by embracing the opportunities of this moment can we achieve our goal of ensuring that the horrors of recent years will never happen again,” Trump told the Knesset today during his speech, adding that “the long and painful nightmare is finally over.” Two members of the Knesset held up signs that said “Recognize Palestine” as Trump spoke, according to a Knesset spokesperson. As the two were escorted out of the room, other members of the Knesset began chanting “Trump! Trump!” Trump was still speaking to the Knesset at time of writing. CNN reports; NBC News reports.

Egyptian and Qatari mediators told Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya that Trump’s deal was his last chance to end the war, following Al-Hayya’s immediate reaction to refuse the deal, according to officials. The sources said that Turkey warned him that Turkey and Qatar would remove all diplomatic and political cover if Hamas did not agree to the deal. Jared Maslin and Summer Said reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Fighting between Hamas Security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City over the weekend killed at least 27 people. The Hamas-run interior ministry said that eight Hamas members were killed in “an armed assault by a militia.” Medical sources said that 19 Dughmush clan members had been killed. Both sides accused the other of triggering the clashes. Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to assert control over areas of Gaza vacated by Israeli troops, according to sources. Rushdi Abualouf reports for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv has enabled Ukraine’s strikes on Russian energy assets, including oil refineries far beyond the frontline, according to Ukrainian sources and U.S. officials. Officials said that the United States has been helping Ukraine mount these long-range strikes for months, in an attempt to weaken Russia’s economy and force them to negotiate. Christopher Miller, Amy Mackinnon, and Max Seddon report for the Financial Times.

Trump said that he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday on the phone about Ukraine obtaining long-range Tomahawk missiles. Trump told reporters during his flight to Israel that before he agrees, he “might speak to Russia about that, in all fairness,” because it would be a “step up” in the war. Megan Messerly reports for POLITICO.

First Lady Melania Trump said on Friday that she has had an “open channel of communication regarding the welfare of children” with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the last three months. The First Lady claimed that eight Ukrainian children had been reunited with their families in the past 24 hours due to the initiative, adding that both sides had “agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all the people involved.” Sophia Cai and Diana Nerozzi report for POLITICO.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The Rapid Support Forces paramilitary has killed at least 57 people and wounded 43 others in a series of drone and artillery strikes on the besieged Sudanese city of El-Fasher overnight into Saturday, according to local medics and aid groups. The Sudan Doctors Network medical advocacy group said the attack targeted a shelter for displaced people and was a violation of international law. The RSF denied that civilians were killed as a result of its strikes. Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

A spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Taliban government yesterday claimed that Afghan forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in “retaliatory” border operations overnight into Sunday. The Pakistani army disputed the figure, stating that 23 of its armed forces’ members had died and that “200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized.” The Taliban have accused Pakistan of violating Afghan airspace and bombing a market in eastern Afghanistan last Thursday. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the alleged assault. Carrie Davies, Stuart Lau, and Ethirajan Anbarasan report for BBC News; Riaz Khan reports for AP News.

French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu late yesterday announced his new government, two days after French President Emmanuel Macron re-appointed Lecornu as France’s Prime Minister on Friday. Lecornu resigned from the premiership last Monday after his coalition partners’ pushback to his first attempt at forming a government last week. Giorgio Leali reports for POLITICO; Noemie Bisserbe and Sam Schechner report for the Wall Street Journal.

Qatar and other Arab states have expanded security cooperation with the Israeli military over the past three years, according to leaked U.S. documents. The documents show that in May 2024, senior Israeli and Arab military officials convened at al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar to discuss the threat posed by Iran. Presentations reviewed by the Washington Post detail the creation of what the U.S. army describes as the “Regional Security Construct”, involving Israel, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. David Kenner reports.

5.7 million Haitians are facing a deteriorating food security situation, with 17% of Haiti’s population suffering emergency levels of acute food insecurity, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) hunger watchdog said in a report published on Friday. According to the IPC, the situation is expected to deteriorate in 2026, with 54% of Haiti’s population projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity. UN News reports; Reuters reports.

Israel yesterday carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon, killing one person and wounding seven others, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck a place where machinery was stored for rebuilding Hezbollah infrastructure. AP News reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge on Friday said the Trump administration had presented a “totally inconsistent” case to keep Kilmar Ábrego García in immigration detention. Since Uganda and Eswatini had refused to take Ábrego, “we’re getting to ‘three strikes and you’re out,’” the judge added. Ghana’s foreign minister posted on social media on Friday that Ghana would also not take Ábrego. The judge said she will decide soon whether Ábrego should remain in custody while his challenge moves forward. Separately, the judge presiding over Ábrego’s criminal case on Friday set a hearing for November 3 to take evidence on whether the charges should be dismissed. Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO; Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

The Labor Department warned last week that “the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens” is threatening “the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S. customers,” according to a document filed with the Federal Register. “Unless the Department acts immediately to provide a source of stable and lawful labor, this threat will grow.” Lauren Kaori Gurley reports for the Washington Post.

The Homeland Security Department announced on Friday that it has awarded 10 construction contracts worth $4.5 billion to add 230 miles of wall along the southwest U.S. border. Reuters reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The U.S. military is moving forward with plans to build a facility in Idaho dedicated to training pilots from Qatar, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday. Hegseth’s announcement drew a rebuke from far-right influencers, including Laura Loomer, who accused Qatar of funding Islamic terror organizations. Hegseth later on Friday posted what he called an “important clarification” on social media, stating that “to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.” Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News; Lillian Rizzo reports for CNBC.

Venezuelan government officials offered the Trump administration a large stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in order to end hostilities during months-long negotiations preceding the U.S. strikes, according to several sources. The sources stated that Venezuela offered to grant preferential contracts to U.S. businesses and terminate contracts with Chinese, Iranian, and Russian firms. The Trump administration last week cut off diplomacy with Venezuela, effectively killing the deal, the sources added. Anatoly Kurmanaev, Julian E. Barnes, and Julie Turkewitz report for the New York Times.

Trump announced on Friday that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese products, adding that they would take effect on November 1. Earlier on Friday, Trump said that he may cancel his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping due to Beijing’s “sinister and hostile” curbs on the exports of rare-earth materials. A spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry said yesterday that “threatening to impose high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to engage with China” and that Beijing will retaliate with “corresponding measures.” Ana Swanson reports for the New York Times; Phelim Kine reports for POLITICO.

The U.N. Security Council met on Friday to discuss the United States’ recent strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean. The 15 members of the council held varying opinions on the strikes, with European and African countries avoiding direct denunciation of the Trump administration’s policies. “The United States will not waver in our actions to protect Americans from narco-terrorists,” John Kelley, a political counsel with the U.S. mission to the U.N. said. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

“The [Reductions in force] have begun,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced on Friday. Vought provided no further details on which federal workers would be fired or how many people had already been laid off. Senior OMB adviser Stephen Billy confirmed that RIF notices would be going out to at least 4,100 employees across several agencies, according to a court filing in a lawsuit filed by unions to stop the layoffs. Irie Sentner and Jennifer Scholtes report for POLITICO; Josephine Walker and Emily Peck report for Axios.

The Trump administration on Saturday rescinded layoffs of hundreds of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who were terminated during the mass firings within CDC on Friday. A senior official said that the employees were sent “incorrect notifications, which was fixed … with a technical correction,” adding that the terminations were mistaken and have been remedied. A CDC official told POLITICO that “entire offices are being eliminated, including people in leadership roles.” Apoorva Mandavilli and Sheryl Gay Stolberg report for the New York Times; Sophie Gardner and Lauren Brensel report.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche were not given notice that federal prosecutors would indict New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged bank fraud last Thursday, according to sources. The sources said the lack of communication was a result of the government shutdown, the rush to bring the indictment, and divisions between department leaders and the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Viginia Lindsay Halligan. Devlin Barrett and Glenn Thrush report for the New York Times.

Trump yesterday announced that he has appointed his longtime aide Dan Scavino as the White House Presidential Personnel Office. Scavino will remain the White House Deputy Chief of Staff while being “responsible for the selection and appointment of almost all positions in government,” Trump posted on social media. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times; Sarah Fortinsky reports for the Hill.

Trump also announced on Saturday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will “use all available funds to get our troops PAID on October 15th,” adding “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our military … HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government shutdown.” About $8 billion is being redirected from accounts that fund military research and testing to pay the army, according to two sources. Ben Johansen and Jennifer Scholtes report for POLITICO.

MIT on Friday rejected the Trump administration’s offer for the school to receive special funding treatment in exchange for signing the administration’s Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. “Fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth said. Vimal Patel reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Over 30 sitting federal judges told the New York Times that the Supreme Court’s brief and opaque emergency orders in cases relating to the Trump administration have caused confusion in the lower courts about how to proceed with those matters. In response to a questionnaire, 47 out of 65 judges also said that the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Trump returned to office. Matthias Schwartz and Zach Montague report.

Democratic state attorneys general have filed 43 lawsuits in which multiple states have challenged Trump policies this year.","By Nate Raymond

BOSTON (Reuters) -A federal judge in Boston had some pointed words for Donald Trump as he issued one of the dozens of decisions by courts in four New England states against the Republican president in challenges to the legality of his policies.

""I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,"" U.S. District Judge William Young wrote in ruling that Trump's administration was violating free speech rights by moving to deport non-U.S. citizen pro-Palestinian activists at American colleges.

Young's September 30 ruling was an example of how federal judges in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine have become key players in the legal wars over Trump's policies since he returned to office in January, as litigants seek a friendly venue to challenge the president.

A Reuters analysis found that at least 72 lawsuits challenging Trump's policies have been filed in federal courts in those four states by plaintiffs, including Democratic state attorneys general, advocacy groups and institutions targeted by the administration. Trial court judges have made at least an initial decision in 51 of those cases, ruling against Trump in 46 of them, the analysis showed.

These have included challenges to Trump's policies to restrict birthright citizenship, gut the U.S. Department of Education, revoke the legal status of thousands of migrants and fast-track deportations of migrants to countries other than their own - so-called ""third countries"" - including politically unstable South Sudan.

While nationwide the U.S. judiciary is closely divided among judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, in these four states 17 of the 20 active federal trial judges are Democratic appointees. These states fall under the umbrella of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose five active judges all were appointed by Democratic presidents while a Trump nominee awaits Senate confirmation.

""I don't think there is another court that, in terms of composition, has those sorts of odds for groups advocating on the liberal side,"" University of Virginia law professor Payvand Ahdout said of the 1st Circuit.

Ahdout said the ideological composition of that appellate court has turned the New England federal trial courts below it into attractive litigation venues offering the ""best shot"" for challengers to Trump's policies.

The 1st Circuit, in handling Justice Department appeals of rulings by these trial judges against the president's policies, has issued 15 decisions, granting the administration's request to set aside judicial orders only three times.

To be sure, the 1st Circuit does not have the final word on cases. It is one of the 12 regional federal appellate courts that cover specific geographic areas of the United States. All of these are one step below the U.S. Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority has moved American law dramatically rightward under Chief Justice John Roberts.

The administration repeatedly has gone to the Supreme Court with emergency requests to implement policies impeded by lower courts, and the justices have almost always backed Trump. The Supreme Court already this year on seven occasions fully or partially put on hold judicial orders against Trump policies arising out of the 1st Circuit's jurisdiction in cases concerning the Department of Education, legal status of migrants and third-country deportations.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters that the administration's policies have been ""consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as lawful despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful lower court rulings from far-left liberal activist judges.""

Trump himself has criticized some of the New England judges. After Boston-based U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy blocked several deportations to South Sudan, Trump called him and other judges ""out of control."" And Trump labeled Boston-based U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, who ruled against the administration in a case involving Harvard University, a ""total disaster.""

""Regardless of where Democrats try to file their challenges, our winning will continue,"" Jackson said.

FORUM SHOPPING

The idea of ""forum shopping,"" seeking a friendly legal venue, is nothing new, as litigants across the political spectrum long have steered cases to ideologically sympathetic judges. For instance, conservatives challenging the agenda of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden flocked to Texas courthouses stocked with Republican-appointed judges to challenge policies concerning LGBT rights, immigration, student debt relief and gun control.

The regional federal appellate court that has jurisdiction over the most challenges this year to Trump's policies is the one that covers Washington, D.C., as might be expected considering it is the seat of the U.S. government. But the courts under the 1st Circuit have attracted the second-most such lawsuits, according to data from Just Security, an online publication based at New York University School of Law.

During Trump's first term in office from 2017 to 2021, the federal courts of Northern California were a favored venue for legal challenges. Trump called the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which handles appeals from there, a ""disgrace"" after it ruled against him in cases including his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries, a policy later allowed by the Supreme Court.

Yet by the end of his first term, Trump had appointed 10 judges to the 9th Circuit, reducing the likelihood that Democratic appointees would dominate its judicial panels that decide appeals.

'KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING'

While the Supreme Court has backed the administration in some important cases this year arising from the 1st Circuit, the Justice Department has not yet asked the justices to review some other adverse rulings from judges in the region.

That means, for example, that decisions by judges in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, remain in place blocking the administration's efforts to make changes in federal elections including limits on counting mail-in ballots, cap federal research funding to universities and disfavor arts organizations seeking grant funding because they support ""gender ideology.""

Among the rulings the administration has not asked the Supreme Court to stay was one by Providence-based U.S. District Judge John McConnell, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, blocking a sweeping federal funding freeze that Trump's White House budget office issued in January.

Until this year, the Rhode Island court rarely heard such cases. Yet when deciding where to file the funding freeze case, Democratic Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the states pursuing the challenge considered New York City before settling on Providence, whose three active judges are, in his words, ""known quantities.""

""You kind of know what you're getting,"" Neronha told Reuters. ""You have some confidence that you'll get a decision that will be well-reasoned and based on the law.""

Democratic state attorneys general have filed 43 lawsuits in which multiple states have challenged Trump policies this year. Of those, 26 have been brought in Massachusetts (13), Rhode Island (12) and the 1st Circuit appellate court directly (one).

Judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the past two months have blocked the administration's cancellation of Harvard's federal funding, its immigration-related conditions on disaster aid and housing grants, and its bid to exclude children of certain migrants from the federally funded Head Start preschool program.

Burroughs, an Obama appointee, wrote in the Harvard ruling that courts must ""step up"" to safeguard free speech rights ""even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.""

'WE THE PEOPLE'

Young was appointed to the bench in 1985 by Republican former President Ronald Reagan.

The judge's docket remains filled with Trump-related cases. The Supreme Court put a hold on one of his rulings reinstating diversity-related National Institutes of Health research grants. Meanwhile, Young is weighing challenges on issues including the administration's halting of wind energy projects, its gutting of climate regulations and its weakening of government vaccine policies.

In his ruling on targeting campus activists for deportation, Young found that Trump's policy violated the U.S. Constitution's protection against government abridgment of free speech. The judge also included in his written decision part of a postcard he received from an anonymous sender who asked him: ""Trump has pardons and tanks ... What do you have?""

""Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States - you and me - have our magnificent Constitution,"" Young wrote, quoting the document's preamble. ""Here's how that works out in a specific case.""",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/fea3f0a/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F5c%2F8d9b419aa1b890da7d8a42787dc0c3%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2025%3Anewsml_LYNXNPEL9C0EK%3A12025-10-13T105335Z_1_LYNXNPEL9C0EK_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP-NEWENGLAND-COURT.JPG,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:44.813442

The statement comes after the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Jenrick, recently denounced what he called 'activist' immigration judges in his speech to the Conservative Party conference and on social media.

He continued by saying that judges who ""blur the line between adjudication and activism can have no place in our justice system.""

Jenrick said on X last week that ""[m]ore than 30 sitting immigration judges have former links to the very activist groups that have ground our court system to a halt,"" noting they had supported and volunteered for organisations and charities such as Bail for Immigration Detainees, which works to end immigration detention.

The Shadow Justice Minister said the examples he had found were not isolated examples but ""point to a judiciary where activism and adjudication seem to go together.""

Legal professionals have been vilified and targeted simply for doing their job. The judiciary is independent from parliament and politicians, and lawyers represent their clients without fear or favour. Politicians have a responsibility to respect the role of judges in upholding the rule of law and interpreting legislation that has been agreed by parliament. Unlike politicians, members of the judiciary are expected to be strictly impartial when considering how the law should be applied. Lawyers must abide by their professional ethics code and ensure that people facing life changing legal problems get a fair hearing.

Politically motivated attacks on the legal profession are irresponsible and dangerous. They weaken public trust and confidence in the rule of law and erode the very foundations of justice that underpin fairness and democracy.

Barristers, solicitors and judges have been subjected to violence, death threats and rape threats. Some have faced threats to their family members. We have repeatedly seen law firms and offices be set upon by protestors. We are deeply disturbed by this rising tide of intimidation targeting those who serve our justice system and uphold democratic principles.

Lawyers should never suffer adverse consequences because they are identified with their clients or their clients' causes. Lawyers are not their clients. Those who are unpopular or despised are still entitled to access the courts just as much as anyone else. Nobody is above the law, including politicians.

Doe brings a Privacy Act case against the relevant agency. Can Doe subpoena the journalist or news organization that published the story to compel their identification of their confidential sources for the information believed to originate in a government file? The D.C. Circuit recently addressed that question in Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 24-5050 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 30, 2025), accessible here, reaffirming, and modestly extending, D.C. Circuit caselaw. This post will discuss the D.C. Circuit’s opinion, and then consider some broader issues related to the interaction of the Privacy Act and the journalist’s privilege ─ most particularly potential ways to relieve some of the burdens Privacy Act plaintiffs face.

I. The Constitutionally Mandated Journalists Privilege

In Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court nominally held that the First Amendment does not confer upon journalists a privilege to refuse to testify before grand juries. The Court split 5-4, with a critical concurring opinion by Justice Powell. He explained that in his view Justice White’s opinion for the Court did not preclude recognition of a qualified First Amendment based journalists’ privileged, asserting:

[As the opinion for the Court suggests] no harassment of newsmen will be tolerated. If a newsman . . . is called upon to give information bearing only a remote and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation, or if he has some other reason to believe that his testimony implicates confidential source relationships without a legitimate need of law enforcement, he will have access to the court on a motion to quash . . . The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. . . In short, the courts will be available to newsmen under circumstances where legitimate First Amendment interests require protection.

Id. at 909-710 (Powell, J. concurring)(emphasis added). Journalists’ apparent loss in Branzburg v. Hayes turned out to be something of a victory, with most Court of Appeals recognizing a qualified First-Amendment-based journalist privilege.[1] However, the federal courts of appeal have held that the privilege can be overcome by “showing that the [journalist’s] information is highly material and relevant, necessary or critical to the maintenance of the claim, and not obtainable from other available sources.” E.g., McGraw–Hill, Inc. v. Arizona (In re Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig.), 680 F.2d 5 (2d Cir.1982); Zerilli v. Smith, 656 F.2d 705 (D.C.Cir.1981). The D.C. Circuit has distilled this test into two elements, believing that the inquiry into the necessity of the information subsumes the question of whether the information is highly material and relevant.

The D.C. Circuit applied its centrality/exhaustion test in Lee v. Department of Justice, 413 F.3d 53 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1187 (2006), which like Zerilli, involved a Privacy Act plaintiff.[2] In Lee, the full D.C. Circuit denied rehearing en banc, but Judges Rogers, Tatel, and Garland each authored dissentals urging full court reconsideration of the panel’s decision.[3] Both Garland and Tatel noted that even though the centrality/exhaustion test sufficiently protected journalists’ First Amendment interests with respect to most types of civil litigation in which a journalist might possess relevant information derived from a confidential source, it was inadequate in Privacy Act cases. In most Privacy Act cases, they explained, the identity of a leaker is itself “the heart of the matter.” Lee v. Department of Justice, 428 F.3d 299,301-302 (2005)(Tatel, J. dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Only “an unexpected confession by the leaker” would avoid the prospect of breaching the First-Amendment-based journalists’ privilege in relation to a plaintiff’s pursuit of a Privacy Act claim. Id. (Garland, J. dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).

II. Chen v. FBI

A. The Controversy and Proceedings Below

Born in China, plaintiff Yanping Chen came to the United States in 1987 to study at George Washington University. She became a lawful permanent resident in 1993 and a citizen in 2001. In 1998, Chen founded the University of Management and Technology (“UMT”) in Arlington, Virginia. The School participated in the Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) Tuition Assistance Program” which subsidized servicemembers’ tuition at the School.

In 2010, the FBI began investigating the veracity of Chen’s statements on various immigration forms, suspecting that Chen had concealed her prior work for the Chinese military. In 2016, after a lengthy investigation and apparently some dispute between the FBI and Government prosecutors over whether prosecution was warranted, prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia declined to file charges against Chen.

Unfortunately, that did not end Chen’s troubles. In 2017, Fox News revealed the allegations regarding Chen’s connections with the Chinese military.[4] Catherine Herridge was one of Fox News’ reporters on the story. Fox News published an FBI form memorializing an agent’s interview with Chen’s daughter, personal photographs seized from Chen’s home during an FBI search, as well as information from Chen’s immigration and naturalization papers. Fox News cited anonymous sources describing a conflict between the FBI and prosecutors regarding whether to file charges against Chen. In addition, Fox News noted an anonymous FBI agent’s concern about UMT’s continued participation in DoD’s Tuition Assistance Program. Unsurprisingly, in 2018 DoD terminated UMT’s participation in that program. DoD’s action and the negative publicity from the Fox News reporting precipitated a sharp decline in UMT’s enrollment and reputation.

Chen brought a suit under the Privacy Act, The Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. § 552a), to recover damages for the disclosure of private information in various files maintained on her by the Government.[5] The Privacy Act prohibits agencies from publicly disclosing certain records regarding individuals without prior consent. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(4), (b). An individual harmed by a Privacy Act violation may bring a civil suit against the offending agency, id. § 552a(g)(1), (5), to recover “actual damages,” subject to a statutory floor of $1,000, for any “intentional or willful” disclosures. Id. § 552a(g)(4)(A). Prevailing plaintiffs may also obtain “the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees.” Id. § 552a(g)(4)(B).[6]

Chen engaged in extensive discovery to identify Fox News’ source for the information leaked from her government files. In addition to submitting various document requests, interrogatories, and requests for admission, Chen’s attorney took eighteen depositions of current and former government employees. Chen’s lawyers also issued over a dozen third-party subpoenas, and obtained declarations from 22 government officials and employees connected to the FBI investigation. Through those efforts, Chen developed a theory that the leaked material came from an internal FBI PowerPoint presentation created by the lead FBI agent on Chen’s case. She surmised that one of the presentation’s recipients had leaked its contents to Herridge. But her theory was not sufficient (at least in her view), so ultimately her indominable efforts at discovery from the Government had proven unsuccessful. Chen v. FBI, 687 F.Supp.3d 115, 118 (D.D.C. 2023).

Consequently, Chen sought to subpoena and depose Fox News and Catherine Herridge.[7] Both moved to quash the subpoenas, but the trial judge found that Chen had met the D.C. Circuit’s centrality/exhaustion test for defeating an assertion of the First-Amendment journalist’s privilege. Id. at 124-28; see, Chen v. FBI, supra, slip op. at 5. Chen was allowed to depose Herridge, possibly to be followed by a deposition of Fox News should the Herridge deposition prove insufficient. Herridge refused to identify her confidential source, even declining to provide information regarding when and how she received the leaked items. The Judge held Herridge in civil contempt.

B. D.C. Circuit Opinion

Herridge raised several arguments on her appeal of the judgment of contempt. First, she argued that Chen had failed to satisfy the “centrality” requirement due to the frivolous nature of her claim. Second, she asserted, the centrality/exhaustion test was inconsistent with the case-by-case balancing approach the D.C. Circuit mandated with regard to breaching the journalist’s privilege. Third, she argued that Chen suit was too unimportant to warrant breaching the journalists’ privilege. Fourth, she urged the Court to use its authority under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Fed R. Evid. 501, to recognize a journalist privilege that extended beyond the scope of the First-Amendment-based journalist privilege.

As to the first, the Court noted that the “centrality” inquiry can encompasses an assessment of the underlying Privacy Act claims’ frivolousness.[8] But it quickly dismissed Herridge’s argument that Chen’s claim was frivolous. Herridge claimed that Chen’s claim was “frivolous” even though she did not deny that there had been an actionable Privacy Act breach, given that there almost certainly was one. Instead Herridge pronounced the claim frivolous because (1) “most” of Chen’s alleged damages were caused by DoD’s independent decision to cut off funds to UMT rather than the disclosure to the public of information from Chen’s file, and (2) “almost all” of Herridge’s reporting was based upon sources other than government files protected by the Privacy Act.

The panel noted that some of Chen’s alleged damages had been sustained before DoD’s funding cut-off.[9] Moreover, even if “almost all” of Herridge’s reporting came from non-government sources, Chen had plausibly alleged that at least some derived from Privacy Act violations—such as the disclosure of photographs seized from Chen’s home during the FBI search. The panel explained that even if Herridge were correct in her assertion that Chen would at best establish she was entitled to only a small amount of damages, the potentially small size of any damages award would not make the case “frivolous.”

With respect to Herridge’s more general argument that the the case was simply not that important in relation to “the social importance of the news story,” the panel refused to engage in the sort of free-form balancing in the name of determining the “centrality” of the information a reporter refuses to disclose. In the panel’s view, that approach was foreclosed by Lee.

Nor was the straightforward application of the centrality/exhaustion test inconsistent with D.C. Circuit precedent. In Zerilli, upholding the subpoena to a journalist in a Privacy Act case, the Court had indeed asserted that “courts should look to the facts of each case, weighing the public interest in protecting the reporter’s sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure.”[10] However, that general observation, used by the Zerilli Court to determine whether any First-Amendment-based journalist privilege existed, did not require case-by-case balancing. Rather, the Zerilli Court had gone on to established “more precise guidelines … to determine how the balance should be struck” ─ setting out the exhaustion/centrality test.[11] In short, the Zerilli Court had engaged in “definitional” or “categorical” balancing, rather than prescribing ad hoc case-by-case balancing.[12]

The Court then refused to recognize a reporter’s privilege under Rule 501. Having concluded that” the First Amendment itself did not entitle Herridge to disobey discovery obligations imposed on every other citizen in the circumstances of this case,” the panel saw “little reason to create that entitlement as a matter of judge-made common law.” In doing so, the panel noted that state shield laws “var[y] widely in [their] scope . . ., both in the abstract and on the question whether case by-case interest balancing is appropriate.” Though the Court did not mention it, the media has been lobbying for a federal reporter’s shield law for years, without success.[13]

III. Observations

The panel’s decision seems clearly correct and faithful to Zerilli and Lee. However, the Chen litigation does prompt some more general observations.

A. The Burden of Exhausting Potential Other Sources of Information

One of the most striking aspects of Chen litigation saga is the costly and time-consuming process involved in exhausting potential alternative sources of information. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has said that as many as 60 depositions could be required to satisfy the exhaustion prong of the centrality/exhaustion test.[14] Few plaintiffs are likely to have the fortitude, the financial resources, and prospect of a sufficiently sizable recovery to bear such expenses over years. Granted, attorney’s fees and litigation costs are available to successful plaintiffs, but such a recovery comes well after the initial expenditure of resources for litigation expenses. Perhaps the option of litigation financing and the potential for representation on a contingency fee basis make engaging in such costly litigation manageable. But even such options may be impractical for plaintiffs with small value cases.

Perhaps the system works acceptably, despite the financial disincentive to sue over a Privacy Act breach that caused only a modest tangible financial harm.[15] But perhaps the process might be fairer and less onerous if either the burden of production were shifted to the Government to prove that the information did not come from a leak, or the plaintiff were able to rely on a presumption that damaging information was improperly disclosed from government files. In some situations, the plaintiff may well be able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, or even by clear and convincing evidence, that the information disclosed to the public had its origin in an improper release of information from plaintiff’s file compiled by a government agency. Indeed, that seems to be true in Chen’s case (even before the extensive discovery in which she engaged).

In those situations, if no contrary evidence has been offered, the inference that the agency disclosed the information, and that it did so intentionally or willfully, might be a sound evidentiary inference. The information was probably leaked from the plaintiff’s personal files, and given the unacknowledged nature of the leak and the leaked material’s use in such a damaging manner, the release was probably intentional or willful. Thus, at a minimum, the courts should allow a plaintiff to rely on such a presumption in making out a prima facie case, without requiring the identification of the specific leaker. Such a presumption would at least allow plaintiff to surmount the hurdles of summary judgment and directed verdict motions. And given the increased probability that plaintiff will prevail courtesy of such a presumption, defendant agencies may be encouraged to investigate for themselves if, and by what means, their records on the plaintiff were breached. As discussed below, any government efforts on this score will likely prove more fruitful and perhaps less expensive than plaintiffs’ efforts to discover the breach.

But courts could go further and shift the burden of production to the defendant agency once the plaintiff has established its prima facie case with the assistance of the above-referenced presumption. This would mean that the agency would be liable unless it proffered an affirmative case that the information came from some source other than its files on the plaintiff, or that the information was released due to an innocent mistake. Such a shifting of the burden of production might provide important incentives for government agencies in two ways.

First, forcing the Government to bear the burden of production will encourage agencies to engage in substantial efforts to identify the employee or employees responsible for the Privacy Act breach. The agency whose file has been breached will ordinarily be in a better position than a private citizen to ferret out the leaker. The agency is more familiar with its own records systems and any restrictions on access to those systems. Moreover, as the employer of those in charge of the records and those with access to it, the agency has means to encourage cooperation and truthful disclosures that private individuals lack. It has more flexibility in questioning its employees; it can question individuals on several occasions as its investigation develops rather than being limited to one deposition. And it also has the power to threaten, or to impose, employment consequences upon employees who may have unlawfully disclosed Privacy-Act-protected data, who failed to take adequate steps to protect its security, or who simply fail to cooperate with investigators.

Second, the greater prospect of Privacy Act liability might well encourage agencies to create or modify mechanisms for monitoring access to personal filed held by the Government. The government could perhaps more easily show that it has exhausted other means that would allow it to carry its burden that it was not the source of the leak.

In any event, with such a shift in the burden of production, Privacy Act plaintiffs would not have to be put through significant financial burdens before the case is concluded. Such financial burdens may well work as a disincentive to bringing suits to vindicate their Privacy Act rights. The journalist’s privilege would remain as robust as it is currently; however, the Government, rather than the the person whose file was likely breached, would have the burden of exhausting potential sources of information before subpoenaing journalists. (Indeed, perhaps the journalist’s privilege may more likely be upheld. Courts considering subpoenas addressed to journalists may view an agency seeking to avoid liability to a Privacy Act plaintiff for a damaging news story less sympathetically than a Privacy Act plaintiff seeking to recover financial losses from what appears to be a Privacy Act breach.)

It is possible, of course, that diligent and well-financed plaintiffs will nevertheless wish to conduct their own discovery, either in an attempt to affirmatively prove their case or due to fears that the Government will be lax in seeking to determine the source of the leak. In such circumstances, it is not clear how much the shift in the burden of production will change the current state of affairs. Moreover, under a regime in which the Government bears a burden, both plaintiffs and the agency defendants might compete in seeking the same information, ultimately resulting in both seeking to subpoena reporters and news organizations. It is not clear, however, that such a situation is problematic.

The approach of shifting the burden of production after some initial showing by the plaintiff is not unprecedented. Such a regime is applicable in the employment discrimination context. See, Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254–55, 258 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).

The tort doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has a similar rationale (granted the doctrine focuses on negligent, rather than intentional or willful, conduct). If a plaintiff proves that an injury-causing event would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence and that the defendant has some level of control over the injury-causing “instrumentality,” plaintiff is entitled to an inference that the defendant beached its duty of care, i.e., was negligent.[16]

In some states, res ipsa loquitur serves to shift burden of production to defendants to prove that the injury-producing event was not caused by their negligence.[17] Indeed, one admittedly controversial case resembles the government leak scenario, namely Ybarra v. Spangard, 25 Cal.2d 486, 154 P.2d 687 (1944); see, RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM §17, comm. f. There plaintiff suffered a neck injury that was very likely caused by negligence, but a number of medical personnel were potentially responsible, and plaintiff could not determine which one or more members of that group had acted negligently. The California Supreme Court shifted the burden of production to the defendants to explain how plaintiff’s neck injury occurred.

B. What if Congress Finally Enacts a Robust Reporter’s Shield Law?

As mentioned earlier, there have been efforts to enact a robust federal shield law for a number of years, the most recent version of proposed shield legislation being the Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act (“the PRESS Act”).[18] Indeed, that PRESS Act passed the House on January 18, 2024. H.R. 4250, 118th Cong. 2d. Sess. (engrossed). (The Senate failed to act on the measure.)[19] The PRESS Act seems to be focused on Government efforts to determine the source of leaks that Executive Branch officials consider harmful to their endeavors;[20] there appears to be little focus on subpoenas to journalists and news organizations in the context of Privacy Act suits. See, H.R. Rep. 118–299 118th Cong., 1st Sess.,[21] For example the House Report on H.R.4250, which passed the House of Representatives on voice vote, did not even reference the Privacy Act litigation.

The PRESS Act provides a virtually absolute reporters’ privilege except in a few circumstances. The Act precludes journalists from being required to disclose “any information identifying a source who provided information as part of engaging in journalism,” or “any records, contents of a communication, documents, or information that a covered journalist obtained or created as part of engaging in journalism.” H.R.4250, §2(8). The privilege may be defeated upon a finding either that “disclosure of the protected information is necessary to prevent, or to identify any perpetrator of, an act of terrorism,” or that “disclosure of the protected information is necessary to prevent a threat of imminent violence, significant bodily harm, or death.” Id., §3. The prohibition does not apply to defamation litigation. Id., §6(1).[22] It also does not apply to any investigation of a journalist or news organization “suspected of committing a crime,” or to any investigation in which a journalist or news organization “is a witness to a crime unrelated to journalism,” or “suspected of being an agent for a foreign power.” Id., §6(2)(A)-(C). In addition, it does not apply to certain investigations involving terrorists. Id., §6(2)(D)-(F). None of these qualifications or limitations on the scope of the privilege would be applicable in the typical Privacy Act litigation.

If a similarly robust shield law is ultimately enacted, the locus of the burden of production in Privacy Act cases will become even more important. Journalist could assert an absolute privilege to refuse to identify a confidential source in Privacy Act litigation, whether the subpoena comes from the private plaintiff or the Government. Thus, the definitive information regarding the identity of any person that breached the Privacy Act and leaked plaintiffs records would be unavailable to both parties. In such a situation, the locus of the burden of production may prove dispositive. The party that must bear the burden of production, whether the Privacy Act plaintiff or the Government, will have difficulty shouldering it. And if some sort of res ipsa loquitor like inference is not available to Privacy Act plaintiffs to survive a motion for summary judgment or a directed verdict, they will not be able to press their cases.

In such circumstances, the Government should have to bear the cost of the unavailability of the evidence. It is likely the files maintained by the Government, under a legal obligation to keep them private, have been released for dissemination to the public in a willful or intentional manner. And it will be the Government, by virtue of a federal statute like the PRESS Act, that would have made the dispositive testimony unavailable, albeit for laudable and substantial reasons. Ultimately, without the prospect of securing journalists’ testimony, Privacy Act litigation will become even more needlessly expensive than it is already and private citizens’ ability to vindicate their Privacy Act rights will be frustrated all the more.

One final analogy suggests that Congress should perhaps include some form of exception for Privacy Act cases, similar to the exception for defamation cases, in any federal shield law.[23] Of course, Privacy Act litigation differs from defamation litigation, because in the latter case the journalist or media entity is a party to the suit, and has allegedly engaged in a wrongful act. The journalist or media entity is neither a defendant nor an alleged wrongdoer in a Privacy Act case. Though, ironically, journalists’ concerns regarding potential defamation liability, or simply getting the story right, may lead them to demand from leakers document contained in government files to which they have access that back up their assertions.[24]

But in another important respect, Privacy Act litigation mimics defamation litigation brought by public officials and public figures, in that both require proof that the defendant acted intentionally, willfully, or with a similar level of culpability. In the defamation context plaintiff must show “actual malice,” namely that the information was published with knowledge of its falsity or with recklessness disregard as to its truth or falsity. New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-280 (1964). In the Privacy Act context, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the agency acted intentionally or willfully. See, Mulhern v. Gates, 525 F. Supp. 2d 174, 183 (D.D.C. 2007).[25]

In the defamation context, courts have explained that the need to show “actual malice,” provides a particularly compelling justification for requiring disclosure of a journalist’s confidential sources.[26] In Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153 (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court refused to recognize a privilege protecting journalists from having to testify or provide documentary evidence regarding the media entity’s editorial process for the story at issue. In addition to noting in general that “[e]videntiary privileges in litigation are not favored,” id. at 174, Justice White observed that it would be inappropriate to create an impenetrable barrier to the necessary proof required to meet the New York Times standard demanded of a public figure. Id. at 170. Similarly, in Zerilli v. Smith, the D.C. Circuit observed: “Proof of actual malice will frequently depend on knowing the identity of the newspaper’s informant, . . . Protecting the identity of the source would effectively prevent recovery in many [public figure] libel cases.” 656 F.2d at 714.

Despite the closeness of the analogy, some government officials might use a Privacy Act suit as a justification for identifying the source of a leak that exposes mistakes, abuse, corruption or other matters that will tarnish the agency. Thus, the exception to the shield law for Privacy Act claims will presumably need to be tailored to diminish the likelihood that such a gambit would succeed.

IV. CONCLUSION

In all likelihood, the trends in the application of the First-Amendment-based journalist privilege in the Privacy Act context will likely continue on along the lines that it has so far. However, one of the two courses suggested above might reduce some of the burdens on plaintiffs in vindicating the rights conferred upon them by the Privacy Act. Plaintiffs would be benefitted by permitting an inference allowing them to establish a prima facie case without identifying the specific government official responsible for the unlawful disclosure of their information. They would benefit even more from shifting the burden of production to the Government, upon some preliminary showing that material disseminated to the public by journalists came from public files.

[2] Dr. Wen Ho Lee was employed by Department of Energy (“DOE”) as a scientist for almost 20 years, between 1978 and 1999. During Lee’s last three years at DOE, the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) investigated him for spying on behalf of the People’s Republic of China. Though the government indicted Lee on 59 counts of mishandling of classified computer files, Lee ultimately pled guilty to just one count. Lee had been held under demanding conditions of pre-trial detention before the plea agreement, for which both the federal Judge overseeing the case and President Clinton expressed remorse.

Clinton, Remarks on the Patients’ Bill of Rights and an Exchange With Reporters Online, accessible at, Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project.

Lee subsequently brought a Privacy Act suit, alleging that DOE and FBI officials leaked information from his personnel file to tarnish his image. The leaked information included his wife’s employment history, their joint financial transactions, details of their trips to Hong Kong and China, and specifics of the investigation, including Lee’s interrogation, and purported results of polygraph tests.

The article began with this sensational introduction: “Based just four miles from the Pentagon in northern Virginia is an innocuous-sounding online school for ‘management and technology’ – which a Fox News investigation reveals has been at the center of multiple federal probes about its leadership’s alleged ties to the Chinese military and whether thousands of records from U.S. service members were compromised.” For a different perspective on the case, see Stuart J. Sia, The Red-Baiting of Dr. Chen and the Dangerous Target It Puts on All Asian Americans (Aug. 7, 2024)..

[5] The defendant agencies included the FBI, DoD, and two other federal agencies. Chen v. FBI, 687 F.Supp.3d 115, 118 (D.D.C. 2023).

[6] Ironically, sometimes Privacy Act breaches of the may occur result from faulty agency production of documents in response to Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests. See, e.g., Human Rights Defense Center v. U.S. Park Police, 126 F.4th 708 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 24, 2025)(refusing to allow agency to claw back portions of records it erroneously provided in response to a FOIA request that had implications for employees’ privacy).

Some of these errors in responses to FOIA request may be less than innocent. The Postal Service released Democratic congressional candidate Abagail Spanburger’s Postal Inspection Service file in 2018 (including, for example, her social security number), in response to a FOIA request by her Republican opponent. Laura Vozzella, Ex-CIA Officer’s Full Personnel File Released in ‘Human Error,’ Postal Service Admits, WASH. POST (Aug. 30, 2018); Michael Tackett, C.I.A. Officer-Turned-Candidate Says PAC Obtained Her Security Application, N.Y. TIMES (Aug. 28, 2018); Michael Tackett, Postal Service Improperly Divulged Spanberger’s Sensitive National Security File, and Asks for It Back, N.Y. TIMES (Aug. 30, 2018). Similarly, the military records of Mickie Sherrill, Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey, were released (with her social security number unredacted) pursuant to a FOIA requester affiliated with opposing candidate Jack Cittarelli’s campaign. Tracey Tully, Release of Democrat’s Naval Record Scrambles a Tight Governor’s Race, N.Y. TIMES (Sept. 30, 2025); Ariana Baio, Investigation Launched Into How Republican New Jersey Governor Hopeful Got Democratic Opponent’s Military Records, THE INDEPENDENT (Oct. 1, 2025). Both “errors” seem suspicious.

[7] Up to that point, the Court had already been called upon the issue opinions on several issues related to the litigation: Chen v. FBI, 435 F. Supp. 3d 189 (D.D.C. 2020); Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 20-mc-107 (CRC), 2020 WL 7668880 (D.D.C. Dec. 24, 2020); Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 20-mc-107 (CRC), 2021 WL 6125379 (D.D.C. Nov. 23, 2021); Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 22-mc-0074 (CRC), 2022 WL 17851618 (D.D.C. Oct. 18, 2022). Chen v. FBI, supra, 687 F.Supp.3d at 117-118.

[8] Chen v. FBI, supra, slip op. at 8 (“if a claim would fail regardless of what the requested discovery might reveal, there is no good reason for deeming the discovery to be centrally important, much less for abrogating the privilege”).

[9] Though it did not so note, presumably even some of the damage to Chen’s business after DoD’s removal of the school from the program resulted from the damaging publicity rather than the DoD’s decision to cut off funding. Indeed, DoD’s own decision might have been influenced by the public nature of the leaks regarding Chen. And, of course, the Privacy Act can be breached by unauthorized sharing of information with another federal agency.

[10] This is true to Justice Powell’s concurrence in Branzburg v. Hayes.

[15] The Privacy Act is particularly critical given the extensive private information held in files compiled on individuals by the federal government and the media’s Free Speech and Free Pless Clause protections for publishing private information improperly provided to it by a government official, see, Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 534-36 (1989)(police report on plaintiff’s rape mistakenly provided to journalists).

[16] RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM §17 (“The factfinder may infer that the defendant has been negligent when the accident causing the plaintiff’s harm is a type of accident that ordinarily happens as a result of the negligence of a class of actors of which the defendant is the relevant member.”). Traditionally, res ipsa loquitur required plaintiff to show that the defendant possessed exclusive control over the injury-causing instrumentality. The courts have wholly or partially abandoned the “exclusive control” requirement. Id. at comm b.

In part, the rationale for res ipsa loquitur is the soundness of the inference from negligence; in part it can also be attributed to the fact that the defendant will usually have better access to the critical information in such circumstances. Id. at comm i.

[17] Id. at comm. j (“[i]n at least a few jurisdictions, res ipsa loquitur creates a rebuttable presumption, thereby requiring the defendant to come forward with some exculpatory evidence or suffer a judgment as a matter of law”); see generally, DAN B. DOBBS, THE LAW OF TORTS §156 (2000) (discussing various procedural effects of establishing res ipsa loqutor).

[19] A shield law bill was also passed by the House in 2007, only to die due to Senate inaction. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, House Passes Federal Shield Law (Oct. 16, 2007); Free Flow of Information Act of 2007, H.R. 2102, 110th Cong.

[20] “In recent years,” federal and state governments clashes in court with the press over the compelled disclosure of confidential source, have involved efforts to identify and prosecute those who leak classified information to reporters. H.R. Rep. 118–299 118th Cong., 1st Sess. 2. The Committee went on to observe:

Journalists argue that these actions have a chilling effect that disincentives whistleblowers and informants from coming forward with critical information. In turn, Americans may be prevented from learning information of a compelling public interest. . . At times, journalists rely on confidential sources to gather information vital to holding public and private institutions accountable.

Id. at 3.

[21] The Act does not apply to civil defamation, slander, or libel claims. This is consistent with some state shield laws, which do not apply or can be waived in defamation cases. See, e.g., Or. Rev. Stat. §44.530(c); 735 ILCS 5/8-9032(b); Tenn. Code Ann. § 24-1-208(b); THE LAW OF DEFAMATION, supra note 1, at §12:62; see generally, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Reporter’s Privilege Compendium.

[22] In general, the First-Amendment-based journalists’ privilege is applied less robustly when a journalist is a party to a litigation, such as in defamation actions. See, Zerilli v. Smith, 656 F.2d 705, 714 (D.C. Cir. 1981)(the “equities weigh somewhat more heavily in favor of disclosure” in libel cases; the journalist is a party and successful assertion of the privilege “will effectively shield him from liability”); see Weinberger v. Maplewood Review, 668 N.W.2d 667, 674 (Minn. 2003)(construing Minnesota Statutes § 595.025 (2002), which provided the prohibition of disclosure . . . shall not apply in any defamation action where the person seeking disclosure can demonstrate that the identity of the source will lead to relevant evidence on the issue of actual malice.”).

[23] The 2007 journalists’ shield law bill that passed the House included exceptions that permitted the privilege to be breached to discover the source of unlawfully disclosures of “individually identifiable health information” and “nonpublic personal information . . . of any consumer.” H.R. 2102, supra, §2(a)(3)(C)(ii) & (iii).

[24] A journalist would understandably insist upon seeing documentary proof or some sort of objectively verifiable proof of the credibility of a leaker’s assertions. Thus, if a source is purporting to describe some photograph in government files or some statement on an immigration application, the journalist may be reticent to publish a story based on such assertions without seeing the relevant document for themselves.

[25] Mulhern suggests that “gross negligence” is sufficient. Id. at 183 (citing Albright v. United States, 732 F.2d 181, 189 n. 25 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).",https://www.yalejreg.com/wp-content/themes/bedstone/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:49.763918

The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national, anti-capitalist political movement with a chapter in Vermont. Speakers decried ICE’s plans, laid out in federal contracting records, made public earlier this month, to hire at least a dozen contracted workers at the agency’s National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. It uses intelligence-gathering networks to generate leads for immigration enforcement agents operating across the eastern U.S.

Demonstrators gathered in the middle of Harvest Lane, the road that runs in front of ICE’s Law Enforcement Support Center — a facility that houses a national ICE tip line — with local police routing traffic around them.

Across the street from that center is another building run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which, on Saturday morning, was vandalized with threatening graffiti that appeared aimed at federal workers. The vandalized building was cordoned off by police tape on Sunday afternoon while the protest was taking place.

Cora Honigford, one of the protest’s organizers, said the group was not responsible for the graffiti and had no information about who had done it. Local and federal law enforcement were beginning to investigate the vandalism on Sunday.

The National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is where the plans that sparked Sunday’s protest would be based, is located about 1.5 miles away from where the demonstration took place and the site of the vandalized building.

Contractors at the targeting center would use social media platforms and online databases to help federal agents locate people who could be facing deportation, as well as friends and coworkers of those people, according to federal records. The plans are preliminary but say work could start as early as May 2026.

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” said Honigford, who’s from South Royalton, in remarks to the crowd, drawing loud cheers.

Protestors held signs bearing slogans such as “No ICE Surveillance” and “ICE Fuera,” using the Spanish word for “out.” They chanted, among other refrains, “No justice, no peace! No ICE or police!”

Several speakers described ICE’s plans for social media surveillance in Williston as an escalation in the agency’s operations on top of the sharp increase in immigration enforcement that has defined President Donald Trump’s second term. The proposed surveillance is likely to target people already impacted by that enforcement the most, said Kate Paarlberg-Kvam, of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, a legal advocacy network for immigrants.

“Make no mistake, that the primary targets for this enforcement would be our Black and brown neighbors, who are advocates for their own dignity,” Paarlberg-Kvam told her fellow demonstrators.

Michelle and Scott Stinson traveled up to Williston for the demonstration from Ludlow. Michelle held an upside-down American flag, which she said was a protest against ICE’s actions and future plans in the state.

“This is wrong,” she said of the proposed surveillance. “They should not be using us as a hub — for anything.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ice-protest-williston-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-13 07:56:47.187341

Reclaiming the narrative of control in migration Ultimately, irregular migration is not only a policy challenge but a test of political leadership.
Both legal migration and fair returns are part of that order.","The gathering of over 100,000 people at the “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London in September — framed as a “free speech” protest and led by far-right figures — was a potential watershed moment for political discourse. These previously unthinkable scenes now play out across Europe.

Right-wing parties have enjoyed a resurgence on a wave of anti-immigration sentiment. As a result, governments across Europe are becoming increasingly hardline on migration. This leads to short-sighted responses that may temporarily reduce numbers, but often come at a high financial, human and ethical cost.

Just days after the rally on 15 September, the first “one in, one out” deportation flight — part of the new Franco-British migration deal — was set to take off. Under the scheme, the UK can return people who arrive by small boats in exchange for an equivalent number of asylum seekers already in France.

But no migrants boarded the flight. A last-minute court intervention halted the first deportation of an Eritrean man, with the ruling citing a potential trafficking claim. The “one in, one out” scheme sits uncomfortably between criticism from both human rights groups and right-wing commentators: the former for its perceived erosion of protection, the latter for being “completely inadequate” to address the scale of the challenge.

It is a familiar story. Like Italy’s attempt at offshore asylum processing in Albania or the UK’s now-defunct Rwanda plan, another “innovative” migration policy so far fails to deliver — even though by now a handful of people have left for France.

Yet, despite a near absence of tangible results, the push for “innovative solutions” remains strong. At the European Political Community Summit in Copenhagen in October, a group of 17 countries issued a joint statement committing to put “innovation at the heart of migration reform.”

The real reasons migration deterrence isn’t working

At the heart of the continuing migration policy failures are a number of misconceptions.

First, the illusion that we can act sequentially: that we must first stop irregular arrivals and increase returns, and only then expand regular migration. Real progress requires doing all three in parallel.

Second, policymakers frequently express a belief that we can “smash the gangs” and disrupt their business model through enforcement directed at smugglers alone. But tackling the supply (the smugglers) without addressing the demand for migration — which in the absence of legal pathways translates into demand for irregular migration — doesn’t work. A comparison with the war on drugs can be made: Many decades and many billions have been spent on fighting the cartels, but this hasn’t done anything to change the demand for drugs.

Instead of disrupting the business model, the current approach to smuggling is boosting their business model. Smugglers we interviewed in North Africa described exactly that dynamic: tighter European controls made the demand for their services increase and their work more profitable.

Third, we must abandon the false dichotomy between “open” and “closed” migration policies. Control and openness are not opposites. Allowing people to migrate legally, in an organised and transparent way, is control. It restores order, ensures vetting, and prevents smugglers from profiting.

Fourth, the eternal cycle of small-scale pilots, especially on regular and labour migration pathways, has to end. From legal migration schemes to cooperation agreements, we have spent years experimenting at the margins. The “one in, one out” deal, capped at 50 people per week, is emblematic of this smallness. If we are serious about reducing irregular migration, we must scale up — not pilot forever.

Learning from recent migratory experiences

Recent experiences have provided valuable learnings. When the EU activated the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) for Ukrainians, granting millions immediate protection, as well as free movement and access to labour and education, it effectively carried out the largest anti-smuggling operation in history. Because there was a legal pathway, there was no market for smugglers.

In the United States, the Biden administration’s combination of significantly expanded legal pathways — both for employment and protection — and stricter border enforcement eventually brought irregular crossings down to less than a quarter of 2023 levels. The model worked, but too late, and without sufficient political ownership and public communication. Europe can and should learn from both successes and mistakes.

A blueprint for a workable European approach to migration

If the current approach and so-called innovative approaches continue to fail, a credible alternative would require the following five elements —to be implemented in parallel.

Migration “one-stop centres” must be established along key routes, providing humanitarian support, information on, and access to, legal migration options, return counselling and support, and opportunities for local integration. This would build on the “Safe Mobility Offices” model launched in the Americas, adapted and expanded for Europe’s context.

Substantially expanded regular labour migration pathways, matched to Europe’s identified labour shortages. This is not only humane but economically sound.

Implementation of fair, fast, and efficient asylum processing at Europe’s external borders, coupled with an effective relocation mechanism among Member States for those granted protection.

Strengthened resettlement programmes that become a genuinely viable solution for those in need of protection, not a symbolic gesture.

Finally, and crucially, ensuring that there are timely, efficient, scalable but fair and dignified return processes for those without a legal right to stay. Significantly expanding regular migration channels could also unlock cooperation from origin countries on returns – stressing again why this all needs to be done in parallel, not sequentially.

Together, these elements create a credible system that combines openness and enforcement — a balance that both voters and migrants can trust.

Reclaiming the narrative of control in migration

Ultimately, irregular migration is not only a policy challenge but a test of political leadership.

People do not just want fewer arrivals; they want order. Both legal migration and fair returns are part of that order. Allowing people to come through safe, legal pathways is taking back control — because it brings migration under the rule of law, not the rule of smugglers.

The task for Europe’s leaders now is to replace rhetoric with realism: to act collectively, communicate clearly, and scale up what works.

Because the real crisis is not one of numbers — it is one of credibility, protection and human dignity.

“I’m scared right now, but I had to bring them.” Across Chicago Public Schools and surrounding districts, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has left families on edge — including the city’s youngest residents.
Their mother, her cousin, is undocumented, so on days when immigration enforcement is especially visible, Diaz steps in to help.
Learning environments Experts warn that persistent fears of immigration enforcement can hinder children’s ability to learn and thrive.
Just in recent weeks, Chicago schools are reporting that more children are missing from class, she said.","Monica Perez scanned the street as she left Funston Elementary, five of her children in tow. She kept her head down, her family close. After school pickup was once a familiar routine — in recent weeks, though, fear had crept into the family’s life and festered.

“Rápido,” Perez told her children, ushering them along Logan Square sidewalks. “Quickly.”

Perez came to Chicago from Mexico in 2007 without authorization. All seven of her children, ages 7 to 16, were born in the U.S. But as federal immigration enforcement intensifies across the city, even the short walk from school feels dangerous.

Perez mentally mapped their route, again and again: one block west, a few blocks north. They moved fast. Just the day before, she had kept her younger children home after hearing reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity near campus.

“Ahorita, ando con miedo, pero los tuve que traer,” Perez, 36, said in Spanish. “I’m scared right now, but I had to bring them.”

Across Chicago Public Schools and surrounding districts, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has left families on edge — including the city’s youngest residents. School staff have scrambled to offer support in the classroom, while volunteers have organized ICE watch groups and student escorts for safe arrival and dismissal.

In response, CPS is expanding its 24-hour Student Safety Center with a dedicated team to triage incidents related to federal law enforcement. The center allows school leaders to report incidents and receive real-time guidance, the district said in a statement.

Schools have also been directed to establish ICE protocols and hold staff trainings, CPS interim Superintendent Macquline King told the Chicago Board of Education Wednesday.

“We understand the weight many of our families are carrying,” King said.

Since the launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” in September, federal agents have made more than 800 arrests in the Chicago area, according to the most recent count from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Trump administration has vowed to target “the worst of the worst,” but many of those detained have no criminal record.

Chicago-area schools have been swept up in the chaos. Several have gone into lockdown and canceled field trips or homecoming events in response to nearby ICE activity. Some parents say they fear being targeted during drop-off or pickup; others are keeping their children home as a precaution. Schools have reported a growing number of students now walking to class alone.

Standing watch

Earlier this month, recess at Funston Elementary was held indoors, after masked federal agents deployed tear gas just across the street. The agents had thrown the smoke canisters when bystanders blocked their vehicle. In the days that followed, scores of volunteers began surrounding the school during dismissal, mobilized through rapid response networks and social media.

On a recent afternoon, Evelyn Medina, 43, stood on a sidewalk handing out neon whistles, flyers and “ICE Out!” signs. Medina owns a gift shop directly next to the school. The tear gas had drifted into her boutique during the recent incident — but her main concern was for the students. Since then, she’s purchased hundreds of whistles for community members.

“I was afraid for the children,” Medina said, watching families walk by. “I think at this point, we have to do what we can to protect each other.”

Just a block away on West Armitage Avenue, Carson Bell, 25, held an “ICE Out” sign beside a small group of volunteers. As children crossed the street, Bell instructed community members to blow their whistles and alert school staff if they spotted federal agents. Bell’s wife works as a special education classroom assistant at Funston.

“It’s scary, because of how the targeting has ramped up around schools … They’re trying to grab people picking up their kids,” said Bell. “How can you plan to face something like that, especially when they’re teargassing right outside?”

Dozens of schools have organized similar patrols. At least three schools on Lincoln Square and Ravenswood went on lockdown following reports of ICE activity Friday. In response, community members are taking proactive steps. At Hibbard Elementary in Albany Park, for example, parents are coordinating a “walking school bus” — a group of children who walk to school together along a set route, accompanied by adult chaperones.

“It has been really an enormous effort, and we’ve been talking about how we can make it more sustainable,” said Maggie Cullerton Hooper, a parent representative on Hibbard’s Local School Council.

In the suburbs and beyond

The surge in ICE activity has extended beyond Chicago’s city limits, bringing anxiety and unrest to neighboring school districts — particularly in the south and southwest suburbs, where many communities are predominantly Latino. But even north of the city, parents have called school officials to say they’re worried about their children waiting at school bus stops.

Students regularly recount their fears to Marisa Mills, a seventh grade teacher at Unity Junior High in Cicero. They’re scared for themselves, their families and their friends. They often have difficulties concentrating, she said. School staff are feeling helpless.

“I’ve had students tell me, ‘I’m really worried about my family … I’m scared that something is going to happen,’” said Mills, who is also the president of Cicero’s teacher union. “To hear that come from one of your kids is devastating.”

Marlene Diaz, 30, receives terrified text messages from her 10-year-old son throughout the school day, begging her to pick him up early. Though they live just two blocks from Cicero East Elementary, Diaz now drives him to school: He’s too afraid to walk. Some of his friends haven’t been to class for weeks.

“It’s just hard. All the time, he’s like, ‘Mom, what about if they deport my friends? Why is all this happening?’” Diaz said. “Sometimes it’s hard to answer him.”

Since President Donald Trump began his second term, Diaz has also started driving her niece and nephew to school. Their mother, her cousin, is undocumented, so on days when immigration enforcement is especially visible, Diaz steps in to help.

The car rides are often silent. “I feel like it’s traumatizing them in all types of ways,” she said.

Learning environments

Experts warn that persistent fears of immigration enforcement can hinder children’s ability to learn and thrive. The deportation of a family member — or even the prolonged absences of a classmate — can lead to ambiguous loss, a type of grief marked by lack of closure, according to Rebecca Ford-Paz, a clinical child psychologist at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.

“Unlike death, where a kid can process grief, ambiguous losses are in limbo, where they don’t really know if and when they will be able to see their loved one again,” Ford-Paz said. “That creates persistent anxiety.”

Chronic stress in children is associated with behavioral issues and longer-term health challenges. A significant body of research also links high rates of absenteeism to lower academic achievement, disengagement and a greater risk of dropping out.

Rebecca Vonderlack-Navarro, vice president of education policy and research at the Latino Policy Forum, said she’s concerned that the visible presence of ICE will compound with chronic absenteeism already facing schools — a residual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Just in recent weeks, Chicago schools are reporting that more children are missing from class, she said.

“This is the antithesis of a safe and steady and inclusive learning environment that students need to do well successfully,” Vonderlack-Navarro said.

‘What else can we do?’

At CPS, parents and community groups have called for a range of additional responses from the district, including expanded safe zones, automatically excused absences and remote learning options.

The Chicago Teachers Union urged the district to prepare for remote learning last month in light of the escalating threat. CPS spokespeople did not respond to questions on whether the district was preparing a remote learning plan.

At the Board of Education committee meeting Wednesday, Chicago Principals & Administrators Association President Kia Banks said school leaders have struggled to navigate the ICE threat, despite weekly briefings. She called on the district to address its current attendance metrics.

“It is tone-deaf right now to ask about enrollment and attendance when parents are afraid to take their children to school,” Banks told board members.

Back at Funston, mom-of-seven Perez guided her son Eduardo by the strap of his backpack. The 8-year-old has autism, and needs a high level of support at home. “Le pongo más pensar en él,” she said. “I worry most about him.”

Perez had spent all day at her mother-in-law’s house, which is closer to the school, so she could walk a shorter distance to pickup. She clutched a small bag of groceries, which she had hurriedly grabbed on the way to reduce her trips outside.

“¿Qué más podemos hacer?” she wondered aloud. “What else can we do?”

The family kept walking.

A Landmark Legal Victory

In what is seen as a landmark ruling, the High Court in Pretoria recently declared the woman a permanent resident, nearly six years after she first applied to the DHA for permanent residency back in September 2019.

Jaco Brits, Head of Immigration at Xpatweb who handled the application and acted on behalf of the applicant, says DHA not only refused her initial application, but also dismissed her subsequent appeal application, dated October 2022, and failed to process her Retired Person’s Visa renewal submitted in February 2023. This renewal was crucial to maintain her legal stay in South Africa while awaiting a decision on her permanent residency and was, in fact, a prerequisite for the PR application to proceed.

“After years of unjustified delays, refusals, bureaucratic dead ends and frustration, the applicant has now been vindicated on all fronts,” says Brits.

Court Orders Immediate Action

In its ruling, the Court ordered the Minister of Home Affairs and Director-General (DG) to issue both a Retired Person's Visa and a Permanent Residence Permit “forthwith”. This brings finality to the woman after years of uncertainty.

Significantly, Brits notes that this is a rare outcome. “In most cases, courts direct the Department to make a decision within a specified timeframe. It does not happen often that the court itself declares an individual a permanent resident.”

In addition, the Court made strong provisions to protect the applicant’s rights in the interim. She may enter, reside and work in, and exit South Africa freely. The Department is prohibited from taking any action that could result in her arrest, detention, deportation, or her being declared undesirable. She may not be sent back to the UK or any other country.

The Minister and DG were ordered to pay the costs of the application, including the costs of Counsel.

Litigation Increasingly the Only Way Forward to Resolve Unduly Long Delays

Brits says the order is indeed a welcome relief, especially as many applicants are left in limbo due to government administrative inaction or when excessive delays impede visa progress that can cause significant disruptions to personal and business affairs.

The recent drive to expedite visa processing appears to have introduced new challenges, including an increase in the rejection of applications and a surge in consequent appeals.

It is clear litigation has become a necessary legal route for applicants facing unreasonable delays in visa or permanent residence adjudication flowing from the historic backlog inherited from the previous administration.

Expert Legal Strategy Can Make the Difference

Individuals who are subject to unduly long delays, should consider expert legal guidance on a formal and structured pathway to resolve these issues promptly, protecting their legal rights and ensuring timely decision-making.

“Our legal professionals are best placed to develop a personalised legal strategy that ensures the Department focuses on a single applicant’s case or family unit. This targeted approach leads to quicker adjudication and increased chances of success,” Brits explains.

,Agencies,2025-10-13 07:42:14+00:00,Organizing My Thoughts,They Came for Our Neighbors. We Showed Up. - Organizing My Thoughts,"Kelly Hayes, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://organizingmythoughts.org/they-came-for-our-neighbors-we-showed-up/,"Soon, we learned that the vendor was still there, but that two other neighbors had been seized.
Neighbors fanned out, searching streets and alleyways for any sign of ICE activity, following up on reports, and communicating what we found.
The corridor of businesses on Clark Street, where many immigrants shop and work, was clearly defended by this mass presence.
Some of us showed up on Thursday in ways that we wouldn’t be able to if this level of ICE activity were a daily occurrence.
Attendees were also encouraged to support businesses on Clark Street, to keep the area active and prosperous in the face of federal attacks.","I was still groggy, drinking my morning tea, when my phone started buzzing with alerts about ICE hitting a corner within walking distance of my home. At first, it was unclear if they had taken a street vendor who was familiar to many of us. Soon, we learned that the vendor was still there, but that two other neighbors had been seized.

That series of texts would soon activate a neighborhood.

I left my apartment on foot, in the clothes I had slept in, and made my way up Clark Street, watching for any signs of ICE. When I saw a suspicious vehicle, I relayed what I’d seen through neighborhood channels that coordinate ICE watch activity. When I reached the intersection of Clark and Lunt, where the abductions had occurred, other neighbors, including some old friends of mine, were already assembling and taking directions from local organizers who had been preparing for this moment for months.

While some parts of Chicago have been targeted relentlessly during the recent federal onslaught known as “Operation Midway Blitz,” Rogers Park had seen more scattered reports of ICE activity—until Thursday, when their presence was confirmed at the start of the day with immigration arrests, and continually reported throughout the morning and afternoon. Neighbors fanned out, searching streets and alleyways for any sign of ICE activity, following up on reports, and communicating what we found. Before long, there were dozens, and then hundreds of people in the streets, watching and responding.

“Clark Street was flooded with people,” Daniel*, an activist with Protect RP, told me. “We had over 200 people on the streets. That was power.” Daniel noted that many people left work early, or “dropped whatever they were doing” to join the effort.

Longtime ICE watchers wore bright orange whistles around their necks, which are used to signal the presence of ICE. Newcomers received whistles from volunteers distributing them in the streets, making the crowds of ICE watchers a clear presence. The corridor of businesses on Clark Street, where many immigrants shop and work, was clearly defended by this mass presence.

Wherever I went Thursday, to follow up on a reported ICE sighting, I was quickly met by many neighbors—and often, they were already there when I arrived. We talked to witnesses who had spotted ICE. We talked to business owners and concerned staff at schools. When people spotted vehicles that had been identified as belonging to ICE, they blew their whistles and jeered loudly, making locations as inhospitable to ICE as possible, while also warning vulnerable people nearby that ICE was present.

“[ICE] had a much harder time trying to take people because there were so many watchers out observing and confronting them,” Rosemary, an organizer with Rad Rogers Park, told me. “Everybody had their orange whistles on, and they were clearly ready. ICE had to be a lot more careful about where they were hitting, and so it was a lot harder for them to take more people.”

In some cases, people on bikes and in cars followed ICE vehicles to track their movements, and even blocked vehicles or otherwise obstructed their path. These actions are risky, as ICE has a history of using chemical weapons and committing other acts of violence against people who attempt to block their vehicles. In one incident, a woman who allegedly blocked in ICE vehicles with her car in Brighton Park—who has also been the subject of other highly questionable allegations—was shot by an ICE agent on October 4, in a moment that stirred another community mobilization.

On Sunday, ICE agents arrested one rapid responder in Rogers Park and pulled their guns on at least three others. In east Albany Park, ICE agents targeted rapid responders with tear gas. “This activity is not risk-free,” Manuel, an organizer with Protect RP told me on Sunday. “People have to make their own decisions—and we are not going to judge anybody for making any decision about what their risk level is, because we don't walk in their shoes, we just walk next to them.” Manuel did offer advice to rapid responders who are trying to remain as safe as possible. “Our first advice to people is to don't do this alone,” he said. “The feds seem to be more cautious when we are in groups, which makes perfect sense because they're bullies.”

Despite the risks, people on the ground are making autonomous decisions about how to confront the violence in their communities as it occurs, and even though these actions are not bound by a unified directive, they are all committed in the interest of solidarity and community safety.

Our city has been rendered wholly unsafe for immigrants, or for anyone who federal agents might profile as an immigrant. To get to work, to take their children to school, to move about their communities, immigrants in Chicagoland must engage with risk. ICE could seize them at the bus stop, at the gas station, or from their own beds in the night. So, some of us have elected to defend immigrants by stepping into zones of unsafety ourselves. For many, this involves taking risks, from the risk of being unlawfully detained by ICE agents while exercising the legal right to film an immigration arrest, to the risk of placing one’s body or vehicle in the way of ICE’s work, or the risk of facing the violence of ICE agents or state police while protesting near the Broadview ICE facility. We are taking these actions to defend our neighbors, the sanctity of our values, and the character of Chicagoland. This is a place where immigrants are loved, needed, and appreciated, and we will not give up members of our beloved communities without a fight.

Some people participated in Thursday’s mobilization remotely, by managing communications between people on the ground or staying in touch with people who were patrolling without a buddy. Maisie, an activist with Protect RP who helped coordinate communications on Thursday, told me that as a disabled person, “to be doing things that were accessible to me physically was really important.” She emphasized that “everybody has a place in this movement and everybody can do something.” As we spoke at a community gathering on Saturday, Maisie told me, “There are people right now who are folding brochures to be sent out in walk packets that we just decided to put together, and people are going to get materials because of them.”

As we took action together on Thursday, we were also aware that this single day of frenzied ICE activity was a daily reality for some neighborhoods across the city. Some of us showed up on Thursday in ways that we wouldn’t be able to if this level of ICE activity were a daily occurrence. As I moved from one reported ICE sighting after another, I felt tremendous empathy for organizers in Pilsen, Little Village, and other neighborhoods for whom this level of federal aggression is a daily grind. They are exhausted. They are constantly grieving the loss of neighbors. And they are also constantly teaching neighborhoods like mine lessons about how to mobilize and respond in the face of shifting conditions.

This is not a story about a moment of victory, but a moment of being reminded of our power. “It took months of us building infrastructure and relationships for something like Thursday to happen,” Rosemary told me.

Being a part of that fabric of relationships and preparedness is rewarding, but it can also be challenging—especially for people who are accustomed to the straightforward intensity of frontline protest. While Rapid Response sometimes involves confrontation, it can often feel like an unfinished sentence or an unanswered question. When we follow up on reports at locations ICE has targeted and left, or may never have been, or patrol fixed areas as a preventative measure, there is a lot of uncertainty, and often, we are holding space as a deterrent, documenting events, or comforting our neighbors, rather than squaring off with the forces that are harming our communities. It’s a form of resistance that requires us to put aside ego, and the need for personal gratification, to become a node in a living network of care, support, and defense.

Maisie urged people who feel moved to protect their communities to find a way to get involved. ""Get out, meet some people, get involved in the groups that are doing this,"" she said. “There are ways for literally everybody to do something, and we have to do it because no one else is going to do it.”

We cannot prevent all of the harm that ICE will do in our communities, but we can make their work harder, and we can make our values, our presence, and our solidarity known. We can make our neighborhoods and our relationships stronger, as we forge bonds in opposition to this violence. On Saturday, nearly 500 people gathered in Rogers Park to protest the recent ICE activity in the community, mourn the theft of those taken, and celebrate the community mobilization that formed in response. Attendees were also encouraged to support businesses on Clark Street, to keep the area active and prosperous in the face of federal attacks.

On Sunday, ICE alerts in Rogers Park began early, with more sightings and arrests, and continued into the afternoon. Many of us took to the streets again, and will continue to do so. Because our community is worth fighting for.

In the central West Bank, Israeli troops stormed homes in Ramallah and al-Bireh governorate, focusing on families of detainees slated for release.

Towns affected included Abwein, Mazari’ al-Nubani, ‘Arura, Beit Rima, Kafr Ni’ma, Deir Ibzi’, ‘Ein ‘Arik, Nabi Saleh, Ni’lin, Deir Jarir, Silwad, and neighborhoods in al-Bireh such as Umm al-Sharayet and al-Am’ari refugee camp.

Occupation forces threatened relatives with retaliation if they displayed any signs of joy or celebration.

At military roadblocks north of Ramallah, soldiers intensified their presence, harassing civilians and blocking dozens of vehicles entering the city.

In the northern West Bank, Israeli troops abducted Hilal Mohammad Azar from his home in Nablus and invaded nearby villages including Zawata and Beit Iba, conducting house-to-house searches.

Earlier, in the Shakara area east of Duma village, illegal Israeli paramilitary colonizers assaulted Palestinian homes and obstructed schoolchildren on their way to class.

At dawn, dozens of colonizers—escorted by Israeli soldiers—invaded the eastern part of Nablus and headed toward Joseph’s Tomb.

The military preemptively invaded the area with bulldozers, firing stun grenades and tear gas, which caused multiple cases of suffocation among residents.

South of Bethlehem, in Deheishe refugee camp, Israeli forces abducted 18-year-old Mohammad Mousa Herzallah after ransacking his family’s home.

Meanwhile, in the village of Umm Safa northwest of Ramallah, colonizers carried out two separate attacks on Palestinian homes under military protection.

They targeted the home of Nadim Khasayeb with stones, damaging solar panels, windows, and a water tank. Hours later, they returned to assault additional homes before being repelled by local residents.

Additionally, Israeli soldiers intensified restrictions at the Tayasir military roadblock on Monday morning, further obstructing Palestinian access to the northern Jordan Valley. Human rights activist Aref Daraghma stated that soldiers closed the roadblock in line with a degrading schedule recently imposed on Palestinian movement through the area.

The Tayasir roadblock has been a site of ongoing repression for over two years, with Israeli forces routinely closing it for extended periods and disrupting traffic.

In recent weeks, authorities have enforced a daily opening and closing schedule, severely limiting freedom of movement for residents and farmers in the region.

Also, the soldiers invaded the home of detainee Ahmad Ka’abna in Aqabat Jabr refugee camp near Jericho in northeastern West Bank, searched the property, and warned his family against holding any celebrations or traveling abroad to receive him.

Ka’abna has been imprisoned since April 26, 1997, and is serving two life sentences plus six additional years.

In the latest development, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it is accepting new (initial) DACA applications once again—but under current court orders, it cannot process or approve those applications at this time.

This announcement comes as many applicants seek clarity on their options and turn to trusted legal professionals for help. Working with an experienced immigration lawyer Los Angeles, CA can provide much-needed insight into how these developments may affect both pending and future filings.

While this may sound like a small technical step, it signals a potentially significant turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding DACA and the government's intent to keep the program alive for so-called ""Dreamers.""

Background: The Legal Battle Over DACA

DACA was first established in 2012 to provide certain undocumented individuals who arrived in the U.S. as children with protection from deportation and the ability to obtain work authorization.

However, a series of court challenges—most notably in the Southern District of Texas (Judge Andrew Hanen) and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals—have found that DACA was not lawfully implemented.

In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit issued a decision striking down key portions of the Biden Administration's DACA regulation but stopped short of completely ending the program. The court sent the case back to Judge Hanen to determine how the program should operate moving forward.

The Current Status: Acceptance Without Adjudication

As of October 2025, USCIS confirms the following:

- Renewal applications for current and prior DACA recipients continue to be accepted and - processed nationwide.

- Initial (first-time) applications are being accepted but placed on hold.

- USCIS will receive and store the filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction is given.

- Advance Parole (for travel) remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.

This ""accept but don't process"" approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved—even if applications are submitted.

For those pursuing long-term legal status or naturalization, consulting a knowledgeable citizenship lawyer Los Angeles, CA may help identify alternative immigration pathways while the courts continue to deliberate.

What Might Come Next

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have asked the court to allow adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not be penalized by a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.

Legal analysts expect that whichever way the Texas court rules next, the case is likely to head back to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final decision on DACA's future in 2026.

Biss confirmed the presence of ICE agents in the city in a social media post around 3 p.m. Sunday, sharing resources for residents to report sightings.
“ICE was once again a presence in Evanston and Rogers Park this AM, with masked men taking multiple members of our community off the street,” he said.
“James Park is directly across from Home Depot,” the email from AYSO Evanston said.
“We were not notified of any pending ICE operation,” said Evanston Police Department Cmdr.","Federal immigration enforcement agents detained two people on Sunday morning outside the Home Depot on Oakton Street in southwest Evanston, according to Mayor Daniel Biss and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Biss confirmed the presence of ICE agents in the city in a social media post around 3 p.m. Sunday, sharing resources for residents to report sightings.

“ICE was once again a presence in Evanston and Rogers Park this AM, with masked men taking multiple members of our community off the street,” he said.

At about 10:30 a.m, ICIRR’s Rapid Response Network also “verified that federal agents abducted two people at the Home Depot on Oakton.”

Following that alert, Evanston’s youth soccer program, AYSO, sent an email to participants allowing coaches to cancel or postpone games scheduled for Sunday.

“James Park is directly across from Home Depot,” the email from AYSO Evanston said. “If you do not feel safe playing your soccer game today, do not go!”

“I am not officially canceling all games today, as many of them are in areas where there is no reported [ICE] activity,” the email continued. “If you feel the need to cancel your game today, please do so. Safety of our players, parents, coaches, referees, and all volunteers is our top priority!”

Sunday’s detention of two people comes on the heels of heightened ICE activity on the North Side of Chicago in recent days, according to ICIRR.

“We were not notified of any pending ICE operation,” said Evanston Police Department Cmdr. Ryan Glew. “We did receive a call about ICE operations on Oakton, but whatever occurred was wrapped up before we responded to assess.”

Under the Welcoming City Ordinance, Evanston is a sanctuary city, meaning that the city and EPD do not collaborate with federal immigration authorities.

It was just after 8:30 a.m. when a woman named Julie looked out her Rogers Park window to see Border patrol agents interrogating a man stopped right in front of St. Jerome Catholic Church.

""I think they've been casing the church... the mass times are down,"" Julie said. ""I think they've been casing the church. There was somebody up there the other day who got picked up. They're in this neighborhood for a reason.""

With a Spanish-language mass going on at that hour, Julie and her partner alerted the priest, along with several others in the neighborhood who took it upon themselves to make sure people were able to leave the church safely.

""I felt really badly for them,"" Julie said. ""They were inside, scared to come out. I can understand why.""

She and others were back again for Sunday evening's bilingual mass.

""The goal here is not to create any conflict, but actually to create a safe space,"" volunteer Angie Guinn said.

Parishioners said they're unnerved, and not just because of what happened Sunday.

""Right now, nobody wants to come out, because they don't want to be deported,"" parishioner Jorge Quiroz said.

The Archdiocese of Chicago did not comment on the incident, but on CNN, Cardinal Blase Cupich spoke on the ongoing raids.

""Yes, we surely have the need for a state to provide safety for people and also secure its borders, but let's not forget that human dignity also has to be preserved,"" Cupich said. ""Many of these people who don't have documents have been here for a long time and contributing to society.""

The Refugee Council has consistently warned that people seeking asylum are being locked out of essential services and pushed into poverty by design.
Frontline organisations working with people seeking asylum, including health, housing and emergency relief services, are stretched to breaking point as demand continues to rise.
Elijah Buol, CEO of Asylum Seekers Centre, says “The systemic lack of a safety net for people seeking asylum has created a growing poverty crisis in our communities.","As we mark Anti-Poverty Week today, the Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA) and Asylum Seekers Centre (ASC) are urging the Australian Government to take immediate action to ensure that people have the right to work to support themselves and to end the systemic exclusion of people seeking asylum from basic services, which is driving thousands into poverty and homelessness.

This exclusion forces individuals and families into cycles of destitution, homelessness, ill health and labour exploitation with devastating long-term impacts, including exposure to modern slavery.

Adama Kamara Deputy CEO of RCOA says “Australia has both the capacity and the responsibility to provide a safety net for all, not just some. People seeking asylum want to contribute, to work, study and build a life, but they continue to be left behind by policies that deny them basic support, putting them at risk.”

“These issues must be addressed as part of broader anti-poverty measures and the Government’s commitment to tackling modern slavery and migrant worker exploitation in Australia.”

Ali* who applied for asylum in 2016 but lost his work rights, continues to struggle without any government support as he awaits the outcome of his case.

“It is very difficult for me, my wife and my daughter who was born here. Since I lost work rights, we all eat less food and we are struggling. We can’t pay the rent and have had to borrow money from friends. This has been the case for over 5 years now.

“If I had work rights and was able to do work, I could help my wife and feed my daughter.”

These experiences are not isolated. The Refugee Council has consistently warned that people seeking asylum are being locked out of essential services and pushed into poverty by design. The same concerns were also raised in Australia’s 2025 NGO Report to the UN Human Rights Council, which was endorsed by over 100 civil society organisations and calls for a restoration of basic support.

Frontline organisations working with people seeking asylum, including health, housing and emergency relief services, are stretched to breaking point as demand continues to rise.

Elijah Buol, CEO of Asylum Seekers Centre, says “The systemic lack of a safety net for people seeking asylum has created a growing poverty crisis in our communities. On the frontlines, we see the devastating consequences every day – families facing homelessness, women escaping domestic violence left with nowhere to turn, people skipping meals or going without essential medical care.

“This is not just a policy failure – it’s a test of our national character. Australians believe in fairness for all. That principle must extend to people in crisis, regardless of their visa status. The government must act to ensure no one is left behind.”

Together with a growing number of sector leaders, peak bodies and community groups, the Refugee Council and Asylum Seekers Centre call on the Federal government to restore a basic safety net for people seeking asylum. This includes access to income support, housing and healthcare, the right to work and study while asylum claims are being assessed, and urgent expansion of the Status Resolution Support Services program so it reaches those in real crisis. Greater investment is also needed in frontline services, and a pathway to permanency for those who have been living in limbo for years.

These solutions are clear, practical and entirely within reach. What is needed now is the political will to act — to save lives, prevent hardship and ensure people seeking protection in Australia are treated with dignity, inclusion and the chance to belong.",https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SafetyNetHeroImage2.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 20:57:12.720438

Whether or not Roan’s words will lead to lasting change is uncertain, but they have undeniably added fuel to an already raging debate.","At the heart of a heated national debate over immigration enforcement, pop singer Chappell Roan found herself in the political spotlight after a bold statement at her recent concert in Pasadena. On October 10, 2025, during a performance at the iconic Rose Bowl, Roan paused between her energetic hits to deliver a message that reverberated far beyond the stadium’s walls. With passion, she shouted, “F*** ICE forever,” repeating the phrase to a chorus of cheers from her California audience, as reported by NME and LADbible.

Videos of the moment quickly spread across social media platforms, capturing not just Roan’s words but the electric response from her fans. The scene was one of jubilation, with some attendees later sharing their emotional reactions online. One fan wrote, “We were there and she was spectacular. She certainly didn’t mince her words!!” Another, visibly moved, posted, “I'm getting misty eyed. I have not heard so many people in one place cheer. It makes my heart beat a bit stronger. Seeing all the hate against my people, has been so devastating to me. Seeing this, makes my heart thank you!!”

Roan’s comments were a clear critique of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency frequently at the center of controversy for its handling of immigration enforcement and the detention of individuals, many of whom have no criminal record. According to NME, Roan not only criticized ICE’s treatment of immigrants but also encouraged her fans to stay informed and involved in advocating for more humane immigration policies that respect human rights.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, wasted no time in responding. Just two days later, on October 12, 2025, DHS issued a statement that was as brusque as it was dismissive. In a comment to TMZ, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Pink Pony Club is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip.” The reference to “Pink Pony Club” nodded to Roan’s popular song, but the message was clear: DHS was standing firm behind its agency and its mission, brushing off the singer’s critique.

This exchange didn’t just highlight the growing friction between artists who use their platforms for activism and the federal agencies they criticize—it also underscored the ongoing, deeply polarized debate over U.S. immigration enforcement. ICE, established in 2003 as part of the post-9/11 reorganization of federal security agencies, has long been a lightning rod for controversy. Critics argue the agency has overreached, detaining individuals without criminal records and sometimes separating families, while supporters maintain that ICE plays a crucial role in keeping dangerous individuals off the streets.

The public’s reaction to Roan’s outburst was swift and divided. Many fans lauded her courage and willingness to speak out, especially in an industry where taking a political stand can alienate segments of the audience. “People screamed louder after that line than they did for the chorus of Pink Pony Club,” one attendee noted on social media. Another joked, “Y'all know how many birds she's gonna anger by this? I love it and I don't even listen to her.”

Yet, not everyone was impressed. Some critics, including Roan’s own fans, questioned the timing and sincerity of her activism. On social media, one user asked, “Where was this energy earlier with Trump/elections?” Another pointed out, “She refused to endorse any Democrat candidate last election but wants to speak up now that she sees real people pushing back.” A third, more cynical voice commented, “I'm sorry, but rich people saying things means nothing to me at this point. I agree with her sentiment, but I'm not going to worship someone who's able to sit in their mansion or go on a stage and say something that people are getting beat on the street for saying.”

This backlash reflects a broader skepticism about celebrity activism—especially when it comes to issues as contentious as immigration. While some see artists like Roan as champions for the marginalized, others view their statements as performative or disconnected from the realities faced by those directly impacted by ICE actions.

The Department of Homeland Security’s response was notable not just for its bluntness but for its attempt to redirect the conversation. By stating, “That’s who we’re getting off of our streets,” DHS sought to frame ICE’s mission as one focused on removing dangerous individuals, specifically mentioning “pedophiles.” This rhetorical move is common in debates about law enforcement, where agencies often highlight their work against the most reviled criminals to justify broader, sometimes controversial, enforcement tactics.

But the exchange also shines a light on the difficulties of public discourse around immigration. As NME observed, the rapid response from DHS demonstrates how controversial these discussions have become, and how challenging it is for public figures to engage with political issues without encountering pushback. The complexities of immigration policy—balancing national security, humanitarian concerns, and the rights of immigrants—make it a minefield for anyone who enters the fray.

The Roan-DHS episode also illustrates the enduring challenge of holding federal agencies accountable and ensuring transparency in their actions. Critics of ICE have long demanded greater oversight, citing cases of abuse and the psychological toll of detention on families and children. Supporters, meanwhile, argue that robust enforcement is necessary to maintain the rule of law and public safety.

For policymakers and citizens alike, the debate remains fraught. Immigration is a perennial issue in American politics, shaping elections and fueling passionate arguments on all sides. The 2024 presidential election saw immigration as a central topic, with candidates offering starkly different visions for the future of agencies like ICE. As the country heads into another election cycle, moments like Roan’s outburst—and the reactions they provoke—are likely to become even more common.

Ultimately, the incident at the Rose Bowl is a microcosm of a larger national conversation. It raises questions not just about immigration enforcement, but about the role of artists in political life, the responsibilities of federal agencies, and the power of public protest. Whether or not Roan’s words will lead to lasting change is uncertain, but they have undeniably added fuel to an already raging debate.

As the music faded and the stadium emptied, the echoes of Roan’s message lingered—reminding everyone that in America’s ongoing struggle over immigration, the battle for hearts and minds is being fought not just in courtrooms and Congress, but also on the nation’s stages.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 20:57:34.854903

But after approaching Illinois State Police officers standing outside the facility, the group’s communion request was rebuffed.

The processing facility has been at the center of ongoing demonstrations in recent weeks. About 11 a.m., protesters marched down Lexington Street toward the center, praying and singing.

Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Jason Bradley called the facility with the religious leaders’ request to give communion. Bradley said ICE denied the request.

Bradley said no reason was given for the denial.

ICE didn’t immediately return a request for comment on why the request was denied.

About 1,000 members of Chicago-area parishes and of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership were part of the delegation.

When the leaders announced to the group that ICE had declined the request, people started yelling “Shame! Shame!”

The group had communion among themselves in the parking lot and street before dispersing to either walk home or board yellow school buses the organizers had rented to take people home.

The Rev. Larry Dowling, one of the priests holding the communion elements, said, “We’re just very disappointed because we simply wanted to bring the love of God and the presence of the Eucharist to these prisoners, which we had been allowed to do before all this stuff happened. So they’re basically rejecting us bringing the presence of Christ and the love of God.”

A spokesperson for the coalition pointed to the 2008 Access to Religious Ministry Act, which allows religious workers “reasonable access” to jails and people in immigration detention facilities to meet with those who wish to “consult about their spiritual needs.”

“ICE has completely shut down and [is] not allowing any ministers inside to provide communion and religious support for many weeks now,” said spokesperson Sarah Rand of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Rand was unsure whether any attempts by other groups had been successful.

Chuck Fitzsimmons led the singing during the procession along Lexington Street to the ICE facility.

“In one sense [the music] keeps up your spirits, but also it focuses us on the message that we are here as one, brothers and sisters all,” he said.

He said he was sad to not be able to share communion with the detainees. “However, these are the times and these are the morals, and I think we were prepared to be denied,” he said.

On Saturday, crews put up barricades in front of the fence that a judge ordered removed by Tuesday per state police orders, according to a crew person on site.

U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt issued a temporary restraining order Thursday ordering the removal of the fence outside the processing facility to be taken down immediately.

The fence, erected in September, was still up as of Saturday afternoon. Officials have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to take it down.

Before the clergy arrived, dozens of protesters had already gathered at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.

About 30 minutes ahead of Broadview’s 6 p.m. protest curfew, some protesters went onto 25th Avenue to heckle a vehicle full of federal agents. Police then declared an unlawful assembly and pushed protesters down the street. State and sheriff’s confirmed 15 arrests throughout the day.

We at Migration Watch have watched and listened closely. Here’s a brief summary of the Labour, Conservative and Reform proposals.

Labour Party

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood promised to stop small-boat crossings, crack down on smuggling gangs (again), and end hotel use for those awaiting the outcome of asylum applications. The focus was, in the main, illegal migration. She would extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for those who have arrived on visas from five to ten years and require applicants to be working, paying taxes, be able to speak English and have clean criminal records.

Conservative Party

Chris Philp, Shadow Home Secretary, unveiled the Borders Plan. This includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, a ban on asylum claims by people who have entered the UK without permission, or those who make a claim at the point of being required to leave having been here for prolonged periods, deport illegal small boat arrivals to safe countries, abolish immigration tribunals and legal aid for those entering, deport foreign criminals and establish a Removals Force to deport 150,000 people per year, including those already in the UK illegally and future illegal arrivals and foreign nationals convicted of serious offences.

Reform UK

Reform UK’s plan, announced by Nigel Farage, would scrap indefinite leave to remain. Migrants would instead have five-year work visas with higher salary requirements and no welfare access; existing ILR holders would reapply and would be able to apply for British citizenship seven years following granting of ILR. Before the conference Reform pledged to detain illegal small-boat arrivals, leave the ECHR, repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and deport 600,000 migrants with no right to be here over five years, focusing on the ‘Boriswave’.

Migration Watch view

We have no expectation that the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or ‘Your Party’ will embrace the policies needed to control and reduce immigration. While Rupert Lowe (Restore Britain) and Ben Habib (Advance UK) both advocate policies which resonate with many people, according to the polls, they are unlikely to be involved in forming the next government.

What Reform and the Conservatives had to say about illegal immigration and asylum was welcome, if expected. However, we were disappointed that their focus was confined largely to this aspect of the immigration problem, with scant attention given to overall immigration, which is more than 20 times the number who have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.

There was no mention of the fact that net migration added more than 2.5million to our population in the five years to mid-2024, or that our population grew by 755,000 in the year to mid-2024 – 98 per cent of that increase due to immigration – with every local authority in England bar one seeing growth. The Labour Party, for its part, also largely avoided addressing this wider issue.

Like the majority of the British public, we want illegal immigration brought to an end, but we also want to hear how the parties propose to deal with the catastrophic levels of legal migration that are driving such profound demographic change – levels which could lead to the white British population becoming a minority by the early 2060s. It was precisely this scenario that prompted Sir Keir Starmer to warn of the risk of Britain becoming an ‘island of strangers’. What a pity that the courage he showed in May appears since to have deserted him.

Migration Watch UK, and the millions who share our concerns, now want to hear from the parties most likely to form or join the next government how they intend to tackle this existential challenge. We would be pleased to share our proposals for how this can be achieved.",https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ukborder.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:56:48.737263

“Of course, we were denied access,” Coulter said.","Three Evanston ministers drove to the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Friday to pray and share a Communion outside the detention facility, but were denied access to the facility.

The Rev. Jason W. Coulter, senior pastor at First Congregational Church of Evanston; the Rev. Britt Cox, executive pastor at United Methodist Church of Evanston; and the Rev. Eileen Wiviott, senior minister at Unitarian Church of Evanston, joined dozens of clergy members representing several religions from across the Chicago area.

“I came to witness this unfolding tragedy that is happening in our community,” said Coulter, as he looked at the two-story detention facility behind high fences about a block away.

The faith leaders organized the Communion service to share what they view as the body of Christ. They wanted to offer it to fellow protesters gathered in Broadview, along with police officers and detainees inside the facility, too.

“Of course, we were denied access,” Coulter said. “But this meal that we understand to be available to all people is being denied to the detainees simply because of their status.”

First visit

Friday was his first time visiting the Broadview facility, about 25 miles southwest of Evanston.

“The treatment that we’re seeing here before our very eyes is heartbreaking, and it really needs to end, and it needs to end now,” he said. “The scene is so very militarized. It is like an occupation — the walls, the barriers, the over-the-top police presence. It’s clear that they’re here not to keep us safe, but to keep us in our place.”

It was Cox’s first visit, too.

“People said it felt a little bit less chaotic and violent as some of the other days before … but it still felt very heightened and controlled,” she said. “It felt that there was a force managing our space, wanting to manage our movement. It was scary having helicopters and federal agents take pictures.”

Wiviott had attended a demonstration in Broadview in early September, before the area was fenced off and before federal agents used tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators.

“It was clear immediately just how different it was from five weeks ago,” she said. “Now, the road is blocked off by police, and you feel the heavy, heavy presence of ICE officers and police.”

Wiviott’s Unitarian Church does not practice the Christian Holy Communion, “but I found that attempting to offer Communion to those who are being caged was really powerful,” she said. “And as somebody who doesn’t explicitly identify as Christian, I still found grace.”

First Congregational Church’s Coulter said he plans to talk to his congregation about what he saw. The trip to Broadview from Evanston takes about an hour. He said he parked on village streets about two blocks from the protest area.

“I want to tell them what is happening in our backyards and let them know that we’re all called in whatever way we can to resist this, to defend our neighbors, to support those that are in trouble and to speak out to say this is not right and it has to stop,” he said.

‘It matters’

“Everybody can come to Broadview to be witness to what is happening, to see the different forms of resistance that are on display here, and to say that you were there. It matters.”

Wiviott added that she would be careful before telling parishioners to come to Broadview.

“I do think it’s dangerous, and I would not ask anybody to do it,” she said. “I have relied on my clergy symbols to give me a measure of safety, although the last several weeks have made me feel much less secure. … I really encourage people to find what ways they can show up.”

One way, she said, is to attend immigration-policy protests called “Shine the Light” in Evanston at 6:30 every Thursday night at one of three intersections: Dempster Street and Ridge Avenue, Chicago Avenue and Main Street, and Lincolnwood Drive and Central Street.

“This is a way of saying we won’t be silent and we won’t be complicit,” Wiviott said. “We want to be beacons of light and show there is another way.”

Said Cox: “This is not going to be a one-time protest. This is going to be a long haul, and it’s going to take all of us. It’s going to take those of us who aren’t used to showing up to events like that, to come out in number.”

Coulter said he was worried before driving to Broadview. “I certainly didn’t want to be tear gassed or struck with a baton or pushed to the ground like some of my colleagues have,” he said. But that did not deter him. “There was a chance that I would face arrest, but that’s not a reason to stay home. I really wanted to be here with all my heart.”

He plans to return. “I’m imagining extending invitations to my family, my friends, my parishioners. I’ll say: ‘If you want to be witness to this with me, we’ll drive down together.’ And I think it’d be good thing to do.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC1773-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 18:58:33.348267

One topic on the agenda concerns the deportation of migrants to centres in third countries.
Under its rules, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.
However, he is also concerned about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding restrictions on movement in secondary facilities and return centres in third countries.
Italy, for instance, sought to host migrants in asylum centres in Albania, but the plan met legal resistance because the facilities were effectively detention centres.","A row erupted in Germany's Bundestag on Thursday over the new European asylum system CEAS.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt wants tougher measures to control illegal migration. One topic on the agenda concerns the deportation of migrants to centres in third countries.

""Balancing humanity and order,"" that is Dobrindt's guiding principle. In other words: not all burdens should fall on the shoulders of just one state, but they must be equally distributed across Europe.

Up to now, the Dublin Regulation was meant to ensure fair distribution. Under its rules, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.

In practice, however, the system did not always function as intended. Deadlines have been missed, member states have not fully cooperated, and migrants bypassed the procedures altogether. The result has been secondary migration and an overburdened system.

Dobrindt: No right to a country of choice for the asylum procedure

There is a right to an asylum procedure, but no right to a country of choice for the asylum procedure in Europe, Dobrindt believes, proposing the deportation of migrants who have committed criminal offences to Afghanistan, as well as establishing secondary centres and return hubs in third countries.

""We are making concrete progress on this,"" Alexander Throm, the CDU/CSU's domestic policy spokesperson, said to Euronews.

In addition to repatriation centres, Throm is calling for the creation of new detention criteria to make deportations ""more feasible"".

""These are people who have come to Europe illegally and have no right to protection, no right to stay here,"" Throm said. ""They should be returned to their home country or, if this is not possible, to another safe third country.""

A 'great idea' but will it fail due to implementation?

AfD's Bernd Baumann considers the idea a fundamentally good one, but has questioned the SPD's ability to implement it

Speaking on repatriation centres, Baumann told Euronews that ""it's a great idea, and it comes from us. We've been doing it for years.""

""But anyone who wants to implement this cannot form a coalition with the SPD,"" Baumann said, adding that ""it won't work with the EU either.""

Baumann believes that implementation can only succeed with national policies.

""The CEAS is anything but effective, because anyone can continue to come in across European borders. Illegal migration would not be stopped, only redistributed because of the 'compulsory quotas',"" he told Euronews.

Can human rights be safeguarded?

Green Party MP Claudia Roth said the concept runs counter to the principle of asylum enshrined in Germany's constitution.

""This permanent reduction to criminalisation of people on the run is really wrong,"" Roth told Euronews.

Roth also emphasised Germany's historical responsibility, ""Nobody leaves their home country without a reason,"" she said.

Left Party MP Clara Bünger pointed out that third countries are not guaranteed to be safe.

""The new CEAS reform will ensure that hardly any people arriving in the EU, in Germany, will receive protection here,"" Bünger warned. ""In the future, the vast majority of people will be sent to detention centres and then shipped to third countries that are not safe.""

The Left Party MP expressed concerns regarding human rights ""Every human being has human rights, fundamental rights, and these are being taken away from them,"" she said, ""They are being moved, put into some kind of camp, and the procedures are being increasingly undermined, and the right to asylum is unrecognisable; it effectively no longer exists"".

Meanwhile, SPD remains divided.

""There are many points in the CEAS that point in the right direction, Hakan Demir, SPD MP, told Euronews. However, he is also concerned about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding restrictions on movement in secondary facilities and return centres in third countries.

In principle, repatriation centres are legally possible, says the SPD MEP. ""But whenever I ask: 'Name me a country that makes this possible now and where the legal conditions are right', I never get an answer,"" Demir said.

In fact, there have already been unsuccesful attempts in the past. Not because of the concept itself, but due to its surrounding conditions.

Italy, for instance, sought to host migrants in asylum centres in Albania, but the plan met legal resistance because the facilities were effectively detention centres. An Italian court later ruled the project as unlawful. However, granting freedom of movement in Albania would have allowed rejected asylum seekers to travel back to the EU via Serbia, rendering the plan ineffective.

The UK's attempt to deport migrants to Rwanda also failed. In this case too, it was not because of the idea of return centres itself. The original plan involved outsourcing asylum procedures directly to the third country, but British courts rejected this approach.

The Conservative Party then proposed handling asylum procedures within the UK instead, but the plan never materialized after Labour blocked it.

The Netherlands, however, has taken a more pragmatic path. The Dutch government recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Uganda to establish a return centre for rejected asylum seekers. Unlike detention facilities, this would serve as an accommodation centre. The pilot project is now moving toward final approval and legal clarification in the coming months.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/50/47/96/1200x675_cmsv2_27b8a229-b5d2-5636-a6bc-d856e5957e9d-9504796.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 15:57:15.164239

Mali said the US programme breaches a 2005 accord guaranteeing long-term visa access between the two nations, and vowed to apply the same financial barriers to US passport holders under the principle of reciprocity.

In a statement released by its Foreign Ministry, Mali said it “has always collaborated with the United States of America in the fight against irregular immigration, with respect for law and human dignity”.

The dispute highlights escalating tensions as the administration of US President Donald Trump deploys visa restrictions as diplomatic leverage to pressure African governments on immigration enforcement and deportation cooperation.

Mali is among seven African countries facing the bond requirements under a year-long pilot scheme that the US State Department says targets nations with high visa overstay rates.

Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, and Tanzania were also added to the programme alongside Mali in late October, while Gambia, Malawi and Zambia were added earlier.

Trump immigration moves

Travellers subject to the bonds must pay up front through a US Treasury Department portal, and can only enter and exit the US through three designated airports.

The money is refunded if visitors depart on time, but forfeited for overstays or asylum applications. Consular officers determine individual bond amounts based on applicants’ circumstances.

The US justified the pilot by citing national security concerns and US Department of Homeland Security data showing more than 300,000 business and tourist visa holders overstayed their authorised periods in 2023.

Critics warn the fees – imposed atop standard $185 visa costs – could deter legitimate travel and harm the US tourism economy ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Mali said it was interested in “fruitful cooperative relations”, but was introducing the measure against US citizens attempting to travel there in the spirit of reciprocity.

The visa bonds are the latest immigration measure following months of efforts by the Trump administration to pressure African nations into accepting deportees, including those not from their own countries.

Several governments have received expelled migrants in exchange for payments or political favours, while others faced swift punishment for refusal.

Burkina Faso had all visa services suspended at its US Embassy after rejecting demands to accept third-country deportees, forcing residents to travel to neighbouring Togo for applications.

South Sudan initially had visas for all passport holders revoked following a deportation dispute, though it later accepted eight people from Asian and Latin American countries.

Most judges are insisting on keeping their scheduled deadlines, pointing to continued immigration enforcement and urgency of the lawsuits, which also include challenges against the end of temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s deportation and federal funding freezes for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Starting Oct. 1, the first day of the government shutdown, DOJ attorneys began approaching courts with requests to delay immigration-related proceedings as part of the department’s plan to limit civil litigation during the lapse in federal funding.

The DOJ shutdown contingency plan states that it will continue to deal with cases where the safety of human life or protection of property would be compromised significantly by a delay. It also states attorneys have to keep working if judges deny the department’s requests.

Some groups suing the government over immigration matters argue that there would be serious impacts to putting the cases on hold.

The case over whether the Department of Homeland Security can end temporary protected status for Venezuelans, for example, affects about 600,000 people directly and could have repercussions for others with these protections.

“It is important because it’s one of the only hopes with little possibility of continuing the protection for people with TPS,” said Jose Palma, a national coordinator for the National TPS Alliance, which is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over ending TPS for Venezuelans.

Palma said moving ahead with the legal challenge is particularly vital in light of a recent Supreme Court decision that allows the government to cut off deportation protections and work authorization for Venezuelans while the ultimate fate of TPS for the population is determined in lower courts.

The case is set to move forward in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel denied the federal government’s request to pause the case because of the government shutdown. However, a federal judge agreed to pause a similar case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts until the end of the shutdown.

Despite DOJ’s efforts to pause proceedings in the lawsuit seeking to stop the second deportation of Abrego Garcia, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland is requiring the DOJ to bring to a Friday hearing witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the steps the government has taken to deport him to Eswatini, Costa Rica or any other country.

During a hearing on Monday, Xinis lost her patience with the government attorneys’ inability to provide information about the administration’s plan to once again deport Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.

DOJ also failed to secure an indefinite pause in the lawsuit filed in February by several cities and counties over the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold funding for “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Santa Clara and San Francisco, along with multiple other counties and cities, have been granted preliminary injunctions by District Judge William Orrick twice, as the lawsuit has grown to include other counties, most recently at the end of August.

Following the most recent ruling, the Trump administration’s attorneys had a deadline of Oct. 16 by which they could respond, but on Oct. 1, they filed for a motion to stay, similarly citing the government shutdown as the reason for the need for an extended deadline.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the DOJ motion states.

Attorneys representing Santa Clara cited the DOJ’s own contingency plan in response, noting “the Department’s (contingency) plan assumes that the judicial branch will continue to operate, though possibly at a reduced level, through the lapse.”

Orrick promptly denied the motion to stay, and the administration has until the original deadline to reply to the ruling.

The judge’s motion “helps ensure that accountability doesn’t stop when it’s inconvenient for those in power,” said Jonathan Miller, the chief programs officer at Public Rights Project, which is representing some of the cities in the lawsuit.

“The federal government can’t use a shutdown as an excuse to halt oversight while continuing to pursue the policies we’re challenging,” he said.

The latest legal bid to stop anti-migrant groups from violating the rights of migrants has failed after the KwaZulu-Natal Division of the High Court in Durban ruled against the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Friday, 10 October.

Since June this year, the anti-migrant group turned political party, Operation Dudula, and NGO March and March have focused attention on blocking migrants from accessing healthcare at public hospitals and clinics across Gauteng and pockets of KwaZulu-Natal.

This targeted campaign has continued for months, even though it violates Section 27 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to access healthcare regardless of immigration status or nationality.

On Friday, the SAHRC turned to the Durban high court to interdict Operation Dudula and March and March from refusing migrants access to medical care outside hospitals and clinics in Durban.

The ministers of police, home affairs, health and the MEC for health in KwaZulu-Natal were added as respondents in the urgent application for failing to fulfil their constitutional obligations to protect the healthcare rights of migrants.

According to the SAHRC, the addition of the government officials came after multiple engagements over the disruptions, with both the Department of Health and the office of the National Commissioner of Police, failed to result in tangible action.

“These state organs, through their engagements with the SAHRC and in the media, indicated that steps would be taken to prevent the denial of access to public healthcare facilities by vigilante groups and individuals. The conduct of Operation Dudula and March and March continues unabated, and no steps appear to be taken to assist the affected patients seeking medical services,” the commission said.

However, Acting Judge David Saks struck the SAHRC’s urgent application from the roll, stating that it was not urgent enough to give the respondents only two days to respond to the 260-page founding affidavit, as they were notified only on Monday, 6 October, three days before the application was set to be heard.

In its founding affidavit, the SAHRC detailed how the commission and several people, including South African citizens, permanent residents and asylum seekers, were denied access to Addington Hospital in July.

Commissioner Chris Nissen said the hospital’s security personnel were increasingly refusing to intervene and allegedly ignoring the actions of March and March and Operation Dudula at the medical facility’s gates.

Advocate Vishalan Naidoo, representing the ministers and KZN health MEC, argued that the incidents outlined in the answering affidavit happened in July, and the SAHRC did not provide evidence of recent incidents, which meant there was no urgency regarding the application.

However, several civil society organisations have reported that the disruptions continue. This was echoed by the SAHRC’s legal representative, advocate Muhammad Zakaria Suleman, who told the court that incidents had been ongoing since July.

Acting Judge Saks agreed with the respondents and struck the urgent application off the roll, with costs.

Dudula sets sights on schools

While another legal bid to interdict the violation of migrant rights has faltered, Operation Dudula, which has set its sights on contesting the local government elections next year, is expanding its focus to public schools with an announcement that it would bar the children of migrants from accessing education when the new academic year starts in 2026.

Dudula’s announcement was more than just empty words. On 22 September, the group took to the streets of Soweto, Johannesburg, to call for the schools to “put South Africans first” and deny migrant children placement.

The organisation claims that migrant children take school placements from South African children, and says that this compounds overcrowding in the South African school system. The group has not provided evidence to support this claim.

EWN reported that Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona met Operation Dudula during the disruptions in Soweto and told the group that schools were not immigration centres and their only role was to provide education.

“We have a constitutional obligation to make sure that we teach all children. Constitutionally, all children of school-going age must be at school. Now it’s even worse – there is an introduction of (mandatory) Grade R and law dictates that those children must be taught,” Mabona said.

Dudula’s disruption of schools and the group’s plans also evoked the ire of Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube, who said Operation Dudula would face the full might of the law if it disrupted schools.

According to the Department of Basic Education, Gwarube had met the Acting Minister of Police and requested that the joint operations structures between the Department of Basic Education, the South African Police Service (SAPS) and Provincial Education Departments be activated to monitor and manage these disruptions.

Strong statements have been issued condemning the group’s actions. The government has been criticised for not taking tangible action to protect the rights of migrants.

Daily Maverick sent questions to both SAPS in Gauteng and the Gauteng DBE to find out how the departments planned to stop Dudula’s continued disruptions.

The questions included:

What steps are being taken to address these disruptions and protect the rights of those affected?

What are the plans to prevent future disruptions and ensure that all residents—regardless of nationality or legal status—can safely access healthcare and education?

Responding to the questions, Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo said:

“The South African Police Service in Gauteng, Johannesburg Metro Police, as well as Gauteng traffic wardens, deploy officials to restore calm and maintain law and order at health facilities where protests have been reported. These deployments are as and when needed.”

Masondo said officials were not passive at the affected health facilities. Gauteng law enforcement agencies worked closely with the departments of health and education to prevent, combat and investigate crimes affecting them.

Daily Maverick had not received a response from the Department of Basic Education by the time of publication.

EFF, NGOs step in

In the meantime, several non-government entities have taken it upon themselves to protect the interests of targeted migrant groups by taking action in the courts.

In September, the Economic Freedom Fighters filed a murder case against Operation Dudula. This followed the death of a one-year-old Malawian child in July, after Operation Dudula allegedly barred the baby and mother from accessing medical care at the Alexandra Community Health Centre in Johannesburg.

Operation Dudula has since denied the allegations, stating that none of its members were at the clinic on that day, News24 reported.

Several organisations have had Operation Dudula in their crosshairs even before the group’s latest target campaign.

In June, Daily Maverick reported on migrant rights group Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia (KAAX), the South African Informal Traders Forum, the Inner City Federation, and Abahlali baseMjondolo’s legal bid to have the Gauteng Division of the High Court in Johannesburg interdict Operation Dudula from assaulting, harassing or intimidating migrants and to stop Operation Dudula from impeding access by the children of migrants to healthcare services and schools.

The Department of Home Affairs and the SAPS were added as respondents to the application for what the civil society organisations called “state-enabled xenophobia”. Home Affairs and the SAPS were accused of collusion for failing to protect migrant communities from Operation Dudula’s targeted harassment and assault since the political party’s inception in 2021.

Judgment was reserved on 11 June, and not much has been heard since.

Speaking to Daily Maverick on behalf of KAAX, Dale McKinley said that Operation Dudula’s continued harassment of migrants indicated its disregard for the rule of law. “They are thumbing their nose at our law, at any kind of judicial oversight,” he said.

“The reason we took the legal case was precisely to prevent these kinds of things – so that we could get a court injunction and interdict to prevent Operation Dudula from harassing … violating other international migrant rights. Yet they’re doubling down and continue to do this,” McKinley said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lerato-OperationDudula-Accountability-copy-scaled.jpg?fit=1280%2C640&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-12 14:57:05.484327

The measure, signed into law this past week by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, comes on the heels of other recently enacted state laws meant to shield students in schools and patients at health care facilities from the reach of President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement actions.

Democratic-led states are adding laws resisting Trump even as he intensifies his deportation campaign by seeking to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities to reinforce U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.

By contrast, some Republican-led states are requiring local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE agents.

“The actions of the states really reflect the polarization of the country on this issue,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports immigration restrictions. “We have seen some states move to cooperate to the greatest extent that they possibly can” with Trump’s administration and others “doing what they can to try to thwart immigration enforcement in their state.”

Across the U.S, state lawmakers this year have passed more than 100 bills relating to immigration, according to an Associated Press analysis aided by the bill tracking software Plural. The measures are divided almost evenly between those providing and denying protections to immigrants.

California is shielding immigrant information

Immigrants comprise a significant portion of California's urban sidewalk vendors. Some have been swept up in immigration enforcement actions, in part, because their outdoor work in public places makes them easier targets than people behind closed doors.

California's street vendors typically need permits from cities or counties. The new law prohibits local governments from inquiring about vendors' immigration status, requiring fingerprinting or disclosing personal information — name, address, birth date, social media identifiers and telephone, driver's license and Social Security numbers, among other things — without a judicial subpoena.

The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, was prompted by concerns that vendor databases kept by local governments could be accessed by federal immigration agents to target people for detention and deportation.

“We’re talking about really security –- security for businesses, security for human beings, security for people who have gone through so much,"" said Sergio Jimenez, a street vending organizer with the nonprofit Community Power Collective in Los Angeles.

Additional laws recently signed by Newsom add immigration status to a list of protected medical information and prohibit schools from granting access to immigration enforcement officials without a court warrant. Another new California law directs schools and higher education institutions to immediately notify staff and students or parents when immigration officials are on campus.

Democratic states create safe places for immigrants

Upon taking office, Trump reversed a policy restricting federal immigration agents from arresting people at sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals. Like California, other Democratic-led states responded with laws attempting to create safe places for immigrants.

A Maryland law enacted earlier this year requires public schools, libraries and health care facilities to restrict access for immigration enforcement officials unless presented with a court warrant. Nevada's Republican governor vetoed a similar measure for schools that had been passed by the Democratic-led Legislature.

Meanwhile, a new Colorado law allows civil penalties of up to $50,000 for public child care centers, schools, colleges, health care facilities and libraries that collect information about people’s immigration status, with some exceptions. New laws in Rhode Island prohibit health care providers and landlords from inquiring about people's immigration status. Oregon also enacted a similar law for landlords.

States split on aiding federal immigration agents

By contrast, Republican-led states have passed numerous laws intended to bolster Trump’s immigration policies.

New laws in Texas, Florida and Arkansas require sheriffs who run jails to enter into federal agreements for their officers to be trained to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State and local participation in the federal 287(g) immigration enforcement program — named after the section of law that created it — has exploded from 135 agreements in 21 states before Trump took office in January to more than 1,000 agreements presently in place in 40 states.

But some Democratic-led states have refused to take part. A new Delaware law prohibits participation in the program, similar to statutes already in place in California and Illinois. Democratic-led Vermont also tightened its restrictions on participating in federal immigration enforcement programs, repealing an exemption that had allow it during emergencies.

A Connecticut law that took effect in October allows people to sue local governments that cooperate with federal immigration authorities in violation of the state’s “Trust Act.”

Public benefits are a point of contention

In Washington, new state laws allow workers to take paid leave to attend immigration proceedings for themselves or family members and prohibit employers from using immigration status to coerce their employees.

But some Republican-led states have enacted laws limiting benefits for people in the country illegally.

A new Idaho law prohibits immigrants without legal status from receiving some publicly funded health benefits, including vaccinations, crisis counseling and prenatal and postnatal care for women. A new Louisiana law requires applicants for public benefits to be screened for legal immigration status and, if lacking it, reported to federal immigration authorities

Several Republican-led states — including Florida, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Wyoming — have adopted laws invalidating certain driver’s licenses issued to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

College tuition discounts are diminishing

Entering into this year, nearly half the states provided in-state tuition to public colleges and universities for residents living in the U.S. illegally. But that number has dwindled since Trump took office and the U.S. Department of Justice began suing states. The federal lawsuits assert states are violating the Constitution by providing in-state tuition for people without legal status while not offering the same benefit to out-of-state U.S. citizens.

Florida repealed its decade-old law allowing in-state tuition for students lacking legal status, effective July 1. Republican-led Texas and Oklahoma both ended similar tuition policies after getting sued by the Justice Department. Kentucky, which has a Democratic governor, also has taken steps to halt its policy after getting sued.

California lawmakers attempted to enhance tuition benefits for immigrants with a first-of-its kind measure allowing community college students who get deported or voluntarily leave the U.S. to continue receiving in-state tuition while taking online courses from afar. But Newsom vetoed the measure earlier this month, citing “significant constitutional concerns” that the tuition break was offered only to students who left the country and not also to residents of other U.S. states.

A bill passed by New Mexico's Democratic-led Legislature this year would have expanded in-state tuition breaks to immigrants who earned income in New Mexico during the previous two years or who attended at least two semesters of adult education courses. But Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham let the bill die without her signature.",https://images.wral.com/bcd78a81-bb10-54f1-ad41-f2ec0be91e14?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-10-12 16:56:43.603353

Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “I am using my authority, as commander-in-chief, to direct our secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our troops PAID on October 15.”

Trump said he had identified the funds to make the payments happen, adding: “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our military, and the entire security of our nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous government shutdown. The radical left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.”

The recent federal government shutdown began on 1 October and is the first since a 35-day closure that happened in December 2018 and extended into the new year during Trump’s first presidential term. The shutdown came as Democrats were looking to regain their footing with voters, who re-elected Trump last year and relegated them to the minority in both chambers of Congress.

More than 1.3 million military personnel across the country would not have received their first post-shutdown paychecks this month, only getting paid for the 21-30 September period. An estimated 750,000 federal employees have also been furloughed.

As the Hill reported, however, federal workers are generally paid once a shutdown ends, whether they are furloughed or working. After the last shutdown in 2018, Congress wrote into law that federal workers must be paid once the government reopens.

On Thursday, the US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the shutdown, even as Trump repeated his threat to make Democrats pay for the funding lapse that has closed federal agencies and furloughed employees across the nation.

Speaking to Punchbowl News, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, expressed confidence in the strategy, saying: “Every day gets better for us.”

The White House announced the layoffs of federal workers on Friday, following through with a threat it made to initiate the mass firings of government employees.

A document filed with a federal court on Friday evening revealed that hundreds of layoffs took place across the executive branch, including about 315 at the Department of Commerce, 466 at the Department of Education and 187 at the Department of Energy.

Union leaders warned the layoffs would have “devastating effects” on services relied upon by millions of Americans, and pledged to challenge the moves in court.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents 800,000 federal and DC government workers.

After Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, wrote on social media that “RIFs have begun”, referring to the government’s reduction-in-force procedure to let employees go, the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, responded, saying: “America’s unions will see you in court.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee44816f3936ce5e6f2f15fcd261554e2048c339/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54f4a4ff3250c65c182c24c643e51c21",N,,2025-10-12 13:57:10.605767

INSIDE TRUMP’S WAR ON DRUGS: POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi pens her latest Compass column, digging into President Donald Trump’s war on drugs that has another target in mind: “The first time President Donald Trump tried to push Nicolas Maduro out of power, he wasn’t coy about it. He accused the Venezuelan dictator of stealing an election, stripped U.S. recognition from Maduro’s government, imposed sanctions on Caracas and rallied other countries to pressure Maduro to quit. It didn’t work.

“In his second term, Trump is targeting Maduro differently, and his message is, uncharacteristically for Trump, less direct. Even though Trump continues to say Maduro is an illegitimate leader, he has said ‘we’re not talking about’ regime change in Caracas. Instead, he’s emphasizing the long-standing accusations that the strongman is a drug lord and a dangerous criminal. The plan, people familiar with the situation tell me, is to force Maduro out as part of Trump’s ongoing fight against drug cartels.”

DRIVING THE DAY

THE CRACKDOWN CONTINUED: A federal appeals court temporarily lifted the block on Trump’s federalization of National Guard troops in Chicago yesterday, but stopped short of green-lighting their deployment in the city, POLITICO’s Gregory Svirnovskiy and Josh Gerstein report. In Portland, where troops are also waiting in the wings, an appeals court appears primed to soon let the deployment move forward.

The two cases mark the latest in a series of whiplash-inducing legal battles over Trump’s mass immigration crackdown and efforts to deal with crime in cities led by Democratic mayors — which has at times been brushed back at the lower levels before receiving friendlier rulings from the Supreme Court. But it’s also part of a larger aggressive escalation of interior enforcement that has become the marquee agenda item of Trump’s second term.

A raft of favorable Supreme Court emergency decisions this year — stripping protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants with temporary protections, among them — has given Trump space to increasingly test the reach of his executive authority to enact what he promised to be the largest mass deportation in history.

The view from the White House: “The administration is confident that our actions will be upheld as lawful, because at the end of the day, they are lawful,” one White House official granted anonymity to speak candidly told Playbook. “You know, if it has to go to a higher court, it has to go to a higher court.”

The military deployments to Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland have been reactive to protests, the official said. Trump has also floated sending troops to other major cities in the future, which the official did not rule out. “Obviously you’ve seen the president wants to and won’t hesitate to protect federal law enforcement officers,” they added.

That confidence extends to Trump’s allies outside the White House. “Even these recent court rulings that you might characterize as setbacks, they’re going to get overturned,” Ken Cuccinelli, who served as DHS deputy secretary during the first Trump administration, told Playbook. “No other president has done this in our adult lifetimes in terms of how they implement immigration policy.”

The National Guard deployment, multiple immigration lawyers and experts told Playbook, is no exception and is poised to be one of the biggest tests of his power.

“He’s winning,” Mark Krikorian, director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told Playbook. “He’s not going to win every case, I don’t think, but he’s winning a lot of them, because the immigration law is designed that way.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council agreed that the office of the president provides Trump with “an enormous amount of hidden weapons,” which he’s deploying at a scale unseen before. But he also said the resistance to Trump’s immigration agenda isn’t causing the administration to consider pumping the brakes. “It’s causing them to step on the gas pedal,” Reichlin-Melnick said.

Rise of the resistance: Still, Democratic leaders from Chicago and Portland aren’t backing down from the fight. “I am not afraid. Do I think that he could do it? He might,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said this morning on ABC’s “This Week” when asked whether he worried about Trump potentially coming after him, given the president’s Truth Social post saying he should be jailed. “But as I’ve said before, come and get me.” Oregon AG Dan Rayfield said Trump’s moves amount to an abuse of power in an interview with Playbook’s own Dasha Burns for “The Conversation” this week.

Where this is headed: Any of Trump’s most controversial moves that land on the Supreme Court’s desk will be meeting a different reality than the first few months. Trump began his second administration in the middle of the high court’s last term, and gained significant deference through so-called “shadow docket” decisions. With the new term just kicking off, there’s more time for the court to chew on cases.

“Trump’s been fortunate to do a lot of the stuff that he got away with during the shadow docket time. I’m not so sure that will continue happening when the Supreme Court has to sit there every week and hear arguments,” immigration lawyer Charles Kuck told Playbook.

But Trump has the time to duke this out in court — and the impact could be far-reaching. “The legal piece will gradually fall away. That may take a little while, like a year and a half, but Trump has started very early in his term,” Cuccinelli said. “There’s plenty of time to legally see these through and to permanently eliminate questions on the legal front, all while employing this relatively new tactic.”

Democrats are still holding out hope that the rule of law will keep Trump in check. “Look, we’ve got to rely on the courts to do the right thing. I realize that sometimes that’s risky business, especially when some have been appointed by Donald Trump,” Pritzker said on ABC this morning. “But we’ve seen that even a Trump-appointed judge out in California, on the West Coast, has ruled against the administration.”

But Trump has found ways to work around court orders slowing his immigration crackdown in the past. Even while the temporary blocks on troop deployments are in place, Trump’s end goal won’t be stymied, said David Bier, immigration director at the libertarian Cato Institute.

“They say you can’t do a National Guard deployment, well, is there some other way to get the military involved?” Bier told Playbook. “There’s a million different ways in which you can kind of get to the same outcome under different rubrics. … We haven’t even seen the half of it yet.”

SUNDAY BEST …

— VP JD Vance on the impending release of the hostages and the war in Gaza, on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “It really should be any moment now, Kristen. The president of the United States is planning to travel to the Middle East to greet the hostages Monday morning … It’s a monumental thing. It’s great of course for their families. But I really do think that it shows what happens when you go outside the traditional failed diplomatic route and actually try something new.” More on Vance’s Sunday show appearances from POLITICO’s David Cohen

— Speaker Mike Johnson on the extension of the Obamacare subsidies, on “Fox News Sunday”: “The Republicans have already said we were going to have thoughtful conversations, deliberation and debate about continuing the Covid-era Obamacare subsidies. Because they don’t expire until Dec. 31. They’re trying to pretend like that’s a September issue. It never was.”

— House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on negotiating with Republicans, on “Fox News Sunday”: “This should be a bipartisan negotiation. … My friends on the other side of the aisle, they seem to believe that health care is an extraneous issue. … It’s a central issue. This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and people throughout this country should be able to afford to go see a doctor when they need one for themselves, their family and their children.”

— Kamala Harris on Trump’s Justice Department, on MSNBC’s “The Weekend”: “What we see is that the rule of law is very much under attack by this president who thinks that the Department of Justice is his personal lawyer and is basically subverting the will of the people around constitutional safeguards. … I think he has a vengeance campaign, which is, I think, really exposing the petty nature of who he is.”

— Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on having conversations amid a wave of political violence, on “Fox News Sunday”: “I feel like when I talk to people, people are not happy with the level of polarization in the country and the inability of people to have conversations with those whom they disagree with. And so I guess my hope is that we are at a turning point in a corner where more people want to know how to have those conversations.”

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. MIDDLE EAST LATEST: Trump will head to Tel Aviv at 3:30 p.m. today, arriving in the Middle East at a tense moment as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel seems to be holding, but is pending the hostage release and prisoner swap that marks the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan to end the two-year war, AP’s Aamer Madhani and colleagues write. Hamas told Israel that it has 20 living hostages in hand and is ready to release them as early as today, WSJ’s Summer Said and colleagues scooped. They will be exchanged for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, per NYT’s Isabel Kershner.

How it’s playing: Thousands of people have been returning to Gaza City as the fragile ceasefire takes effect, but the area has been ravaged by war and many are returning to find their homes and former lives are gone, NYT’s Liam Stack and Bilal Shbair report. But the families of Palestinian prisoners said they feel “rare happiness” at the imminent exchange, NYT’s Fatima AbdulKarim writes from the West Bank. Preparations are also underway for an influx of critical humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, per AP.

Order of operations: Trump arrives in Tel Aviv at 2:20 a.m. Eastern time Monday morning, where he will meet with hostage families and deliver remarks to The Knesset around 4 a.m. Eastern. He will then fly to Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for a Middle East peace ceremony at 7:30 a.m. Eastern. He will depart Egypt to return to the White House at 10 a.m. Eastern.

For your radar: Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the phone yesterday, per CBS. “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well - including the Russian war,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X recounting the call.

2. SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: Trump said yesterday he directed the Pentagon to pay U.S. military troops despite the government shutdown, heading off the prospect of troops missing their paychecks this Wednesday, POLITICO’s Ben Johansen and Jennifer Scholtes report. The Pentagon is redirecting about $8 billion from their research and development accounts to pay the troops. “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Cutting deep: After reduction-in-workforce orders were sent Friday kicking off mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies, a number of employees at HHS who were initially tabbed to be laid off are now being rehired, POLITICO’s Sophie Gardner reports. Sources said an unspecified number of CDC employees were mistakenly fired through a “coding error.”

Where things stand: The Senate remains at an impasse on how to proceed. WSJ’s Lindsay Wise writes “even the ‘Groundhog Day’ jokes are getting old now.” House Democrats will be on the Hill Tuesday for an in-person caucus meeting — but the House remains out and is nearing a month without any votes.

The impact: WaPo’s Jacob Bogage and Hannah Natanson break down how the shutdown has already caused flight delays, closed helplines at the IRS, shut off national parks and more — but the effects will only get worse as missed paychecks could cause a consumer spending dip.

3. WEAPONIZATION WATCH: Federal prosecutors met yesterday to square the details of a potential indictment against former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, CNN’s Katelyn Polantz reports. Bolton is under investigation in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland, and prosecutors there initially pushed back on the investigation against the desires of DOJ leadership, requesting more time to prepare a case by the end of the year. But the office is now discussing potential charges, and whether to subject Bolton to a “perp walk” or otherwise public arrest.

Trump vs. James: Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s U.S. attorney in Virginia, faced intense backlash after charging former FBI Director James Comey, but it didn’t deter her from presenting charges against New York AG Letitia James days later, WSJ’s Sadie Gurman and Meridith McGraw write. Halligan “wanted to just get it done,” and will likely bring more charges against James.

On the charges: “In the Eye of a Political Storm, a Tiny Yellow House in Norfolk, Va,” by NYT’s Jonah Bromwich and colleagues: “Attorney General Letitia James of New York purchased the $137,000 home for a grandniece who needed tranquillity. Prosecutors say it is an impermissible investment property.”

4. IMMIGRATION FILES: “Trump administration says immigration enforcement threatens higher food prices,” by WaPo’s Lauren Kaori Gurley: “The Labor Department warned in an obscure document filed with the Federal Register last week that ‘the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens’ is threatening ‘the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S. consumers.’ … The Labor Department’s comments appear to be the first time that the Trump administration has publicly acknowledged that its hallmark immigration policy — sealing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants — threatens labor shortages and higher food prices.”

5. SCOTUS WATCH: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday on a landmark case that could erode what remains of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, NYT’s Abbie VanSickle writes. The case centers around 12 Louisiana voters who challenged the state’s district map, saying that they had been discriminated against as white voters, because state lawmakers took race into account when the map was drawn in 2020. Though figures from such high-profile cases can sometimes become publicly known names, the identities of the 12 voters in this case have largely remained hidden.

6. CALIFORNIA SCREAMIN’: The viral videos depicting California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter derailing an interview and berating staffers are driving momentum for strategists trying to coax other candidates like Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) into the race, NYT’s Laurel Rosenhall and Benjamin Oreskes report. “The videos offered fresh evidence of fears expressed behind closed doors by power brokers in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles: Can a politician who appears so volatile run the state of California?” One political consultant told the NYT that Porter’s record of staff turnover “is the worst kept nonsecret in California politics.”

Fun read: “7 times politicians imploded in TV interviews,” by POLITICO’s Aaron Pellish

7. ANATOMY OF AN ENDORSEMENT: Florida AG James Uthmeier was endorsed by Trump to run again next year, a move that initially jolted Florida Republicans but stemmed from Uthmeier’s work on “Alligator Alcatraz” and securing the land for Trump’s presidential library, POLITICO’s Gary Fineout and Kimberly Leonard break down this morning. “The president’s endorsement lowers the possibility of a contentious Republican primary next year and lessens the chance of a full-blown Trump-DeSantis proxy war across the ballot.”

8. DANCE OF THE SUPERPOWERS: China hit back today at Trump’s threat of a potential 100 percent tariff on its products. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one,” China’s Commerce Ministry said, per AP’s Ken Moritsugu. Trump threatened to ramp up import costs by Nov. 1 — and a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is on the rocks after Trump cast doubt on whether it would be productive. “If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the Commerce Ministry post said.

The bigger picture: POLITICO’s Megan Messerly and Phelim Kine write that the tit-for-tat actions on tariffs this week is “the sharpest escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing since the two countries slapped triple-digit tariffs on each other this spring and threatens to derail months of quiet efforts to stabilize the relationship” and it “raises fresh doubts about whether Trump, operating with a hollowed-out national security team and a fragmented China strategy, is prepared for Beijing’s latest power play.”

9. THE MAHA AGENDA: The massive backlash to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s calls for pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol is bringing out a bigger problem — most drugs don’t have enough data on their safety during pregnancy, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. State abortion bans are worsening existing barriers to women’s health, including drug trials and other studies, as the legal repercussions loom over scientists. Much of the “gold-standard science” lauded by the administration has become more difficult to test on pregnant women and throwing a wrench in the greater mission to do safety testing.

TALK OF THE TOWN

IN MEMORIAM — “Bart Barnes, a Washington Post journalist for five decades, dies at 87,” by WaPo’s Harrison Smith: “Reflexively self-deprecating, [Bart] Barnes was 87 when he died Oct. 5 at his home in Washington. As a Post reporter, he had covered a little bit of everything: Local news, politics and sports (including an NFL players’ strike), along with cops and courts. … But he found an enduring home on the paper’s obituaries desk, where he wrote thousands of stories about the famous, the infamous and the hardly known.”

OUT AND ABOUT — MSNBC hosted its “MSNBCLIVE ‘25: This Is Who We Are” event in New York City yesterday, bringing together dozens of the network’s hosts with members of the MSNBC audience. Hosts Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell, Nicolle Wallace, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, Martin Sheen and more came together for programming and discussions that focused on the state of the world.

Immigration arrests by federal agents were nothing new in Chicago.
On the Southwest Side, a street vendor who was known for the flowers he sold outside a car dealership was arrested by federal agents.","Crowds of bystanders heckled and pointed cellphone cameras at federal agents during arrests. Immigration officers deployed tear gas and fired pepper balls to disperse protesters. Schools emailed parents in the middle of the day with warnings: Immigration agents might be nearby.

These scenes from the Chicago area in recent days looked far different from what residents were seeing along city streets about a month ago, when the Trump administration announced the start of a crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago and its suburbs.

What began with a slow uptick in arrests has escalated rapidly. One unauthorized immigrant was fatally shot. American citizens have been detained along with undocumented immigrants. Border Patrol agents have walked in groups through downtown Chicago. Residents have given chase to federal agents’ vehicles. And chemical agents have been used on protesters, journalists and clergy members.

By this week, tensions were high, and many Chicagoans said they sensed a city on edge.

The New York Times reviewed more than 100 videos taken in the Chicago area over the past month, chronicling the actions of federal agents and the response by the public. Videos captured protests, raids, arrests on city streets and residents’ confrontational responses. Together, the videos show how tensions have risen, unfolding in charged and adversarial scenes in locations scattered around the city.

Federal authorities originally told local officials that they expected the operation to last 45 days. There now appears to be no end in sight.

Sept. 5-11

A Slow Ramp Up

From the beginning, residents in heavily Latino neighborhoods in the city were wary of the promised escalation by immigration authorities. But in a city of 2.7 million spread out across more than 200 square miles, other residents seemed unconcerned or unaware, with few early signs of a crackdown visible along their streets.

Some residents began sharing information on social media about possible sightings of immigration authorities in the city and in far-flung suburbs, warning one another to stay alert. Other residents applauded the actions of federal agents, saying that they supported efforts to more strictly enforce immigration law.

Thousands marched downtown in an energetic protest, chanting and beating drums while denouncing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting support for other causes, including the plight of Gazans in the Middle East.

Immigration arrests by federal agents were nothing new in Chicago. And small, regularly scheduled protests and prayer groups had been held outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, a suburb about 30 minutes from downtown, for years. But this felt different. Federal authorities boarded up windows and doors of the ICE facility, and more and more protesters began gathering outside on some evenings.

Celebrations for Mexican Independence Day mostly carried on. But tensions flared. On the Southwest Side, a street vendor who was known for the flowers he sold outside a car dealership was arrested by federal agents. He was later deported to Mexico.

A video of his arrest spread on social media, angering community members. For days, neighbors left flowers and candles on the sidewalk where he had worked.

On Sept. 8, the Department of Homeland Security officially announced the start of Operation Midway Blitz, targeting “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago.” Sightings of immigration arrests began to multiply.

Sept. 12-28

A Shooting Alarms the City

On the morning of Sept. 12, two immigration officers pulled over a man driving a silver Subaru on a busy street in a Chicago suburb shortly after he had dropped off his children at an elementary school and day care. When the driver attempted to pull away, an agent shot him in the neck. Officials said that the man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a Mexican national who federal officials said was not authorized to live in the United States, had attempted to hit the officers with his car. He did not survive.

Last weekend, tensions escalated further.

Outside the ICE facility in Broadview, federal agents threw smoke bombs at a large group of protesters, tackling and slamming others to the ground. Protesters heckled agents about their roles in carrying out President Trump’s deportation efforts, calling out questions to the agents like “What are you going to tell your children?”

In footage shared with The Times, federal agents shouted at a group of protesters to move. “You’re getting ready to get it,” Mr. Bovino told the crowd, threatening them with arrest, while members were yelling at the agents. Mr. Bovino grabbed a man and tackled him to the ground with the help of another agent.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/us/politics/Cover_top-art_Chicago01/Cover_top-art_Chicago01-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:57:14.371869

“We don’t need another detention center here.” About 30 miles northeast of Denver, Hudson’s once-privately run prison has been shuttered for more than a decade.
In August, members of Colorado’s congressional delegation were told that the Hudson facility was going to reopen for that purpose.
But it’s unclear when exactly the facility will reopen or if ICE is still planning to do so at all.
(Geo also operates the Aurora contract facility, ICE’s only detention center in the state.)","HUDSON — More than 70 people protested Saturday against plans to open a new immigrant detention center near a rural community north of Denver, with organizers calling on state and local leaders to stop the facility from reopening.

Carrying signs that likened immigrant detention facilities to concentration camps, protesters organized mass phone calls to Gov. Jared Polis’ office and to elected officials in Hudson, urging them to oppose the reopening of the Hudson Correctional Facility. They chanted and voiced broader opposition to the mass arrest-and-deportation program undertaken by the Trump administration, the scale of which prompted federal officials this year to seek new detention options in Colorado.

Jessica Hernandez and her sister Michelle, both of Greeley, held a sign for their father, who they said was a military veteran deported in 2005. He still lives in Juarez, Mexico, they said. As protesters chanted and spoke into a microphone, tuba player Yehuda Serotta punctuated sentences and chants with the horn slung across his body.

“Excuse my language, it’s [expletive],” Michelle M., who provided only her last initial because of concerns about her job, said of the plans to reopen the Hudson prison. “We don’t need another detention center here.”

About 30 miles northeast of Denver, Hudson’s once-privately run prison has been shuttered for more than a decade. But documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union indicated that its owners had offered the prison to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a potential new detention center. In August, members of Colorado’s congressional delegation were told that the Hudson facility was going to reopen for that purpose.

Shortly after, the Washington Post reported that Hudson was one of three new detention facilities that ICE officials were targeting in the state, based on leaked agency documents.

Hudson’s city manager, Bryce Lange, and Mayor Joe Hammock did not return messages seeking comment this month. When The Denver Post reported in August that the Hudson facility was apparently set to reopen as a detention center, Lange said the town had not been informed of the plans. In July, Hammock told Denver 7 that he considered the prison reopening to be like any other new business coming to town and that he would support it.

In a statement Saturday, Polis spokeswoman Shelby Wieman said the governor’s office has “not heard any communications directly from the administration about potential facilities or ICE operations in Colorado.” She noted that the Hudson prison was not a state facility and was not on state-owned land, suggesting the decision to reopen the prison was up to private companies and a federal agency.

“Gov. Polis has repeatedly called for the Trump administration to be transparent about their operations in Colorado and has not received that courtesy,” Wieman wrote.

When it was last open, the Hudson Correctional Facility had a capacity of 1,250 beds. If it opens and is filled to that same capacity, the detention center’s population would nearly rival that of Hudson, which is home to more than 1,600 residents.

The protest was organized by Jenifer Montes of the Immigrant Partnership Team of Greeley and Weld County, and it spread on social media. Shelby Mendoza drove from the nearby town of Keenesburg after hearing about the protest on TikTok. She said she felt sick when she learned that ICE was planning to reopen the prison.

“My son goes to school down Highway 52,” she said as a light rain fell. “It makes me sick knowing that he is going to school in a town — or in between a town — that has a concentration camp.”

According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, ICE officials were planning to rechristen the former Hudson Correctional Facility as the “Big Horn Detention Facility.” The newspaper reported that it was set to be opened before the end of year.

But it’s unclear when exactly the facility will reopen or if ICE is still planning to do so at all. Highlands REIT, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust that owns the prison and offered it as a detention center, did not return a message seeking comment.

Geo Group, the private prison company that previously operated the prison, also did not return a message seeking updates on the facility. (Geo also operates the Aurora contract facility, ICE’s only detention center in the state.)

Geo has not publicly disclosed any contracts with ICE to open or operate the facility, and no such contracts have been released on federal spending databases. In July, congressional Republicans’ tax-and-spend bill provided tens of billions of dollars in new funding to ICE, including $45 billion for detention.

Some of that money appears to now be moving: CoreCivic, another private prison company, recently announced new ICE contracts to operate detention facilities in California, Oklahoma and Kansas. Geo has also extended its contract for the Aurora facility and increased the detention capacity there, federal contracting records show.

Lucie Donovan, a 25-year-old teacher who attended and spoke at the protest Saturday, said her husband has been detained in the Aurora detention center for the past eight months. The two married last month. Donovan said they signed the marriage license separately because they couldn’t do it together.

With the help of a lawyer, she’s working to get him released from the Aurora facility.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” they added.
Hundreds of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas had originally deployed to Illinois earlier this week at the direction of the Trump administration.
California sued again this month and won when the Trump administration aimed to send California’s National Guard troops to Oregon after a federal judge blocked the deployment of Oregon’s National Guard there.
The Trump administration appealed a federal judge’s ruling that blocked the state’s National Guard from being federalized and deployed.","A federal appeals court on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit ruled that members of the National Guard in Illinois right now can remain federalized, but they can not be deployed in the state.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” they added.

The move came after the Trump administration appealed an earlier decision by a federal judge to temporarily block the deployment of National Guard troops in the state.

In response to Saturday's ruling, a White House spokesperson indicated that a further appeal was coming.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,"" Abigail Jackson said in a statement. ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Representatives for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Hundreds of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas had originally deployed to Illinois earlier this week at the direction of the Trump administration.

It comes as President Donald Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law, to continue to deploy members of the military in American cities if the courts uphold the deployment of the troops in multiple legal challenges.

Last week, Trump federalized members of the National Guard to deploy troops near Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, saying that the troops would help keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Oregon and Illinois safe and that they would help these cities address crime.

The Democratic governors and mayors of Illinois and Oregon have pushed back on Trump’s moves, with each state engaged in ongoing litigation to block the deployment of National Guard troops in their states.

In response to reports about a growing threat of wildfires in Texas, Pritzker wrote in a post on X that “Texas is preparing emergency resources for wildfires and floods. The Texas National Guard should be THERE — not in Illinois. We stand ready to support their return home so they are best positioned for helping Texans respond to any natural disasters.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration federalized the California National Guard to quell anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. That was blocked by a federal judge who ruled in September.

California sued again this month and won when the Trump administration aimed to send California’s National Guard troops to Oregon after a federal judge blocked the deployment of Oregon’s National Guard there.

A three-judge panel for the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in California is currently weighing a case on the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon. The Trump administration appealed a federal judge’s ruling that blocked the state’s National Guard from being federalized and deployed.

The panel, made up of two Trump appointees and a Clinton appointee, seemed likely to grant the administration’s request that the lower court’s temporary restraining order be reversed, with one judge suggesting Trump, in his capacity as president, should get more deference in his decision-making.

One of the judges said the court would deliver a decision as soon as possible, but did not offer a specific timeline.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251011-national-guard-ch-1535-0740c6.jpg",N,,2025-10-12 12:57:47.058445

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Border Patrol, has accused her of throwing an object at a Border Patrol car. WGN reported that she hasn’t been charged with a crime.

A man recording the incident asked for her name. Brockman, whose LinkedIn lists her as a producer, identified herself and said she works for WGN, a Chicago-based news station. “Let them know,” she said.

Agents then placed her in the back of an unmarked gray Chrysler minivan with tinted windows as onlookers yelled at them.

News producer 'threw objects' at Border Patrol agent's vehicle, DHS says

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, said Border Patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations at the time of the incident. She said “agitators” used their cars to block agents, and agents then hit a suspect’s vehicle to create an opening.

As agents were driving, Brockman, an American citizen, “threw objects” at the car, McLaughlin said. Agents then placed her under arrest on suspicion of assault on a federal law enforcement officer, she added.

Another video of the incident, published by WGN, showed an object flying in the air near a van. Later, Brockman was cuffed.

WGN confirmed in a statement that the employee has since been released and no charges were filed against her. The statement didn’t name her out of respect for her privacy.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago didn't immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by USA TODAY on Saturday, Oct. 11.

What's going on in Chicago?

The incident came a day after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against federal agents targeting journalists covering protests against immigration enforcement in the Northern District of Illinois, which includes Chicago. USA TODAY contacted the Chicago Headline Club, one of the news representatives that requested the order, about Brockman and the Oct. 9 order, but has not received a response.

Chicago area communities have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, for more than a month.

President Donald Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Illinois, arguing that clashes between federal agents and protesters require troops in the state. Illinois officials say sending troops is unwarranted and have challenged their deployment in court.

On one side, President Donald Trump declares the city a war-torn “hellhole” requiring deployment of National Guard troops to help enforce his administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as the Department of Homeland Security posts propaganda videos on social media.

Appeals court denies Trump administration request to halt judge’s ruling on National Guard pending appeal

On the other, more than a million people, largely tourists from around the world, are gathering across the city and at Grant Park to urge on runners in the Chicago Marathon after tens of thousands had converged in Wrigleyville to cheer on the Cubs.

“This is JB Pritzker reporting from war torn Chicago,” the state’s Democratic governor said Thursday in a mock field report for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” wearing body armor while walking along a quiet sidewalk on the riverfront’s Wacker Drive.

“As you can see, there’s utter mayhem and chaos on the ground. It’s quite disturbing,” he said. “The Milwaukee Brewers have come in to attack our Chicago Cubs. We’ve seen people being forced to eat hot dogs with ketchup on them and our deep dish pizza, well, has gone shallow. So it’s a challenge to survive here in the city of Chicago, but there’s no hellscape that I’d rather be in.”

Pritzker’s “report” came as U.S. District Judge April Perry on Thursday handed the governor, along with other Illinois Democrats and administration opponents, a major victory by issuing a temporary restraining order that blocked the president’s federalized Illinois and Texas National Guard troops from duty to assist with immigrant enforcement activities.

Pritzker knows that Chicago’s issues are more than binary pictures. And while the governor has placed his faith in the judiciary, there are questions whether a stream of recent federal court defeats for the Trump administration will only prompt a more serious reaction from Trump, using the powers of the presidency at his disposal and his willingness to go after those who he perceives as his political enemies.

Trump did not have a good week in federal court in Chicago.

In addition to the National Guard ruling, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt on Thursday ordered the removal of a fence erected outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility’s Broadview detention facility for violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land.

Also Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal agents from using pepper-spray bullets, tear gas and other weapons associated with riot control against journalists and protesters who don’t pose a serious threat. Ellis also banned federal agents from using physical force or arrest against journalists unless they are crime suspects.

And on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings extended until February a consent decree that limits ICE agents’ authority to make warrantless arrests and requires them to disclose monthly any warrantless arrests they make. Cummings also found that the agency had violated the consent decree earlier this year.

“You want me to express joy? Look, I am pleased, if that doesn’t come across my face and my words. I am very pleased,” Pritzker told reporters Friday of Perry’s National Guard ruling.

“We’ve always said that we have to rely on the judiciary to be the check and balance on what the president and the Congress are trying to do or sometimes failing to do,” he said. “So we’re going to take them to court. We think we’re going to get the right results, because we know that it’s unconstitutional for him to attack our states and our cities the way that he has.”

But the victory may only be temporary. The Trump administration has already appealed Perry’s ruling to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. And as Perry was hearing arguments in the case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to be favoring Trump and presidential “deference” in a challenge to a similar ruling by a federal judge in Oregon who blocked the president’s federalization of the California and Oregon National Guard for deployment in Portland.

As Perry did in her ruling, Judge Karin Immergut found conditions on the ground at protests of ICE facilities did not constitute a “rebellion” or were as dire and in need of a federal response as portrayed by administration lawyers. Immergut said the federalization issue was “untethered to the facts.”

But during a simultaneous hearing of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump-appointed Judge Ryan Nelson questioned whether the judiciary can put conditions on presidential National Guard deployments.

“I am sort of trying to figure out how a district court of any nature is supposed to get in and question whether the president’s assessment of executing the laws is right or wrong,” Nelson said.

If the 7th Circuit in Chicago and 5th Circuit based in San Francisco reached opposite conclusions, it would provide the legal grist for the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to decide — a prospect viewed as providing Democrats an unfavorable outcome.

“This thing could be in the Supreme Court in a couple of weeks. So it is a victory, certainly, but it’s just the first step, and what could be a long road of appeals,” said Pat Brady, a former federal prosecutor and state GOP chairman who has not supported Trump.

“The courts tend to give deference to the president on national security issues and that’s what the appellate court looks like looks like it’s doing” in the Oregon case, Brady said.

Even if the lower court rulings stand, Trump also has the ability to invoke the two-century-old Insurrection Act to make military deployments on domestic soil that go far beyond the protection of federal assets and agents that were part of his original federalization of the National Guard.

“I’d do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”

The Insurrection Act allows a president to deploy the military to “suppress rebellion” or “insurrection” when enforcing federal law becomes “impracticable.” It is an exception to the federal Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits the use of U.S. military assets from taking part in law enforcement actions on domestic soil.

Past Supreme Court rulings have given the president broad discretionary powers to decide if conditions have been met to invoke the Insurrection Act. But the nation’s highest court has left the door open for judicial review to determine if a president invoked the law “in bad faith” or in going beyond “a permitted range of honest judgment.” And the actions of the military, once invoked, are also subject to judicial review.

Invocation of the Insurrection Act would almost surely be contested in court by Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul, leading to another series of court battles.

“I think the governor and Kwame are doing this for all the right reasons,” said veteran Democratic political consultant Pete Giangreco. “So the question becomes, where, at what point, does the Illinois attorney general and the Illinois governor run out of legal cards? I think we’re rapidly getting to that place.”

With Pritzker a high-profile Trump critic as he seeks a third term as governor and also considers a potential 2028 bid for the White House, there are also questions how far a president who has vowed revenge against his political enemies will go.

Trump previously floated a suggestion that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson be “jailed,” something largely viewed as fanciful political rhetoric.

But the state could face consequences regarding attempts to cut federal grants and funds beyond the Trump administration’s recent move to freeze $2.1 billion in previously approved transit funding, largely dedicated to the effort to extend the CTA’s Red Line to the Far South Side, out of concerns over “race-based contracting” for the project.

“Trump is always going to double down. He is always going to try to win the fight,” Giangreco said. “He either backs down or he doubles down. And he’s been much more into the double down way lately.”

Brady said “pretty much everything Trump’s been doing recently as president, from the tariffs on, are all pushing the limits of what his authority is and that’s been a conservative strain of thought forever, that the executive needs to be stronger.”

“This is going to be a battle and there’s going to be consequences,” he said. “I think there’s big risk, but I understand exactly why they’re doing it as Democrats: You can’t sit back.”

The administration is offering $1,000 to people who leave voluntarily using the CBP Home app.","SEATTLE — Ramón Rodriguez Vazquez was a farmworker for 16 years in southeast Washington state, where he and his wife of 40 years raised four children and 10 grandchildren. The 62-year-old was a part of a tight-knit community and never committed a crime.

On Feb. 5, immigration officers who came to his house looking for someone else took him into custody. He was denied bond, despite letters of support from friends, family, his employer and a physician who said the family needed him.

He was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, where his health rapidly declined in part because he was not always provided with his prescription medication for several medical conditions, including high blood pressure. Then there was the emotional toll of being unable to care for his family or sick granddaughter. Overwhelmed by it all, he finally gave up.

At an appearance with an immigration judge, he asked to leave without a formal deportation mark on his record. The judge granted his request and he moved back to Mexico, alone.

His case is an exemplar of the impact of the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to deport millions of migrants on an accelerated timetable, casting aside years of procedure and legal process in favor of expedient results.

Similar dramas are playing out at immigration courts across the country, accelerating since early July, when ICE began opposing bond for anyone detained regardless of their circumstances.

“He was the head of the house, everything - the one who took care of everything,” said Gloria Guizar, 58, Rodriguez’s wife. “Being separated from the family has been so hard. Even though our kids are grown, and we’ve got grandkids, everybody misses him.”

Leaving the country was unthinkable before he was held in a jail cell. The deportation process broke him.

It is impossible to know how many people left the U.S. voluntarily since President Donald Trump took office in January because many leave without telling authorities. But Trump and his allies are counting on “self-deportation,” the idea that life can be made unbearable enough to make people leave voluntarily.

The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, said judges granted “voluntary departure” in 15,241 cases in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, allowing them to leave without a formal deportation mark on their record or bar to re-entry. That compares with 8,663 voluntary departures for the previous fiscal year.

ICE said it carried out 319,980 deportations from Oct. 1, 2024 to Sept. 20. Customs and Border Protection declined to disclose its number and directed the question to the Department of Homeland Security.

Secretary Kristi Noem said in August that 1.6 million people have left the country voluntarily or involuntarily since Trump took office. The department cited a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions.

Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said 1.6 million is an over-inflated number that misuses the Census Bureau data.

The administration is offering $1,000 to people who leave voluntarily using the CBP Home app. For those who don’t, there is a looming threat of being sent to a third country like Eswatini, Rwanda, South Sudan or Uganda,.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the voluntary departures show that the administration’s strategy is working, and is keeping the country safe.

“Ramped-up immigration enforcement targeting the worst of the worst is removing more and more criminal illegal aliens off our streets every day and is sending a clear message to anyone else in this country illegally: Self-deport or we will arrest and deport you,” she said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.

A Colombian woman dropped her asylum claim at a June appearance in a Seattle immigration court, even though she was not in custody.

“Your lawyer says you no longer wish to proceed with your asylum application,” the judge said. “Has anyone offered you money to do this?” he asked. “No, sir,” she replied. Her request was granted.

Her U.S. citizen girlfriend of two years, Arleene Adrono, said she planned to leave the country as well.

“They treat her like a criminal. She’s not a criminal,” Adrono said. “I don’t want to live in a country that does this to people.”

At an immigration court inside the Tacoma detention center, where posters encourage migrants to leave voluntarily or be forcibly deported, a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala in August that he wanted to leave. The judge granted voluntary departure.

The judge asked another man if he wanted more time to find a lawyer and if he was afraid to return to Mexico. “I want to leave the country,” the man responded.

“The court finds you’ve given up all forms of relief,” Scala said. “You must comply with the government efforts to remove you.”

Ramón Rodriguez crossed the U.S. border in 2009. His eight siblings who are U.S. citizens lived in California, but he settled Washington state. Grandview, population 11,000, is an agricultural town that grows apples, cherries, wine grapes, asparagus and other fruit and vegetables.

Rodriguez began working for AG Management in 2014. His tax records show he made $13,406 that first year and by 2024, earned $46,599 and paid $4,447 in taxes.

“During his time with us, he has been an essential part of our team, demonstrating dedication, reliability, and a strong work ethic,” his boss wrote in a letter urging a judge to release him from custody. “His skills in harvesting, planting, irrigation, and equipment operation have contributed significantly to our operations, and his absence has been deeply felt.”

His granddaughter suffers from a heart problem, has undergone two surgeries and needs a third. Her mother doesn’t drive so Rodriguez transported the girl to Spokane for care. The child’s pediatrician wrote a letter to the immigration judge encouraging his release, saying without his help, the girl might not get the medical care she needs.

The judge denied his bond request in March. Rodriguez appealed and became the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that sought to allow detained immigrants to request and receive bond.

On September 30, a federal judge ruled that denying bond hearings for migrants is unlawful. But Rodriguez won’t benefit from the ruling. He’s gone now and is unlikely to come back.

Led by Gregory Bovino, a particularly hardline Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sector chief from southern California, border patrol agents have become a daily presence in several major cities across the US.

Earlier this month in Chicago’s Southwest Side, a border patrol shot a woman multiple times amid protests against the Trump administration’s militarized immigration raids in the city.

This summer in Los Angeles, border agents on horseback swept through a public park downtown – riding alongside national guard troops and other agents in military vehicles. In southern California, videos of border patrol agents pinning down and beating 48-year-old landscaper ​​Narciso Barranco went viral.

Agents have also made arrests in California’s agricultural Central Valley and at New York immigration courthouses. They have set up immigration checkpoints in Washington DC.

Lawyers and human rights advocates say the agents, who are trained to block illegal entries, drug smugglers and human traffickers at the country’s borders, may be ill-suited to conduct civil immigration enforcement in urban communities.

“The border patrol is certainly quite cavalier, and has been very aggressive historically as it goes about its enforcement responsibilities,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University. They tend to do their work in rural places and isolated parts of the United States. And they generally are not trained in community interactions and policing.”

Until recently, the agency usually worked close to the southern US border – especially along the south-western border – though the department has long had the authority to conduct patrols more inland.

Under a 1946 statute, Border Patrol agents have the ability to conduct warrantless searches within a “reasonable distance” – or up to 100 miles – from any international boundaries. Those boundaries include international land borders as well as coastlines – so in effect, their range encapsulates most US major cities – including LA, New York and Washington DC. Chicago falls within this 100-mile zone, because the Great Lakes are considered a maritime boundary.

Nearly two-thirds of the US population lives within the zone.

Still, García Hernández said, until recently, it was highly uncommon to see border patrol agents stray far from the south-western border.

But now illegal border crossings are at a historic low, and the administration has deployed thousands of military personnel to the southern border, freeing up the Border Patrol, he said – ready and available as force multipliers in the administration’s deportation mission. The department currently has about 19,000 agents. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses the Border Patrol, is about 60,000 strong – making it the largest law enforcement agency in the country.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), meanwhile, has about 5,500 immigration enforcement officers, plus an additional 7,000 agents tasked with investigating cross-border criminal activities. Though the agency is making a massive push to hire 10,000 more agents, that process is expected to take some time.

It’s unclear exactly how many Border Patrol agents have joined up with Ice and other federal agents in raids targeting Chicago, Los Angeles and other big cities.

DHS did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s query.

As border agents stray away from their original mission, legal experts have raised concerns that they are bringing along with them a culture of combative enforcement. “CBP has a history of problematic treatment of people, in my opinion, perhaps worse than any other law enforcement agency,” said Deborah Anthony, a professor of legal studies at University of Illinois Springfield with an expertise in constitutional law and the legality of Border Patrol operations.

The Border Patrol has long had “more leeway” with the US constitution’s fourth amendment’s protections against random and arbitrary stops and searches, Anthony said. They are able to set up checkpoints and, in some cases, roving patrols, she said – but these authorities are limited by law.

Agents cannot pull people over without “reasonable suspicion” of an immigration violation, or search homes or vehicles without a warrant or probable cause.

In recent deployments, however, agents appear to be flouting these restrictions. Earlier this month, Border Patrol agents, along with other federal agents, conducted a military-style immigration raid of an apartment complex in Chicago. Video evidence showed agents indiscriminately bursting through front doors.

“All the evidence suggests there were egregious violations of rights, both in the treatment of people, in the lack of a warrant, in the breaking down of people’s doors, in what seems to be almost indiscriminate targeting of almost everyone in the building,” Anthony said.

Immigrant advocates have had limited success in opposing this type of indiscriminate enforcement. In a January operation that took place shortly before Trump took office, plainclothes border agents poured into California’s Central Valley region, conducting random stops along the highway. In response, the ACLU sued the Border Patrol on behalf of the United Farm Workers union – and a federal district court found that the operation violated the fourth amendment.

And in June a federal lawsuit from advocacy groups accused the Border Patrol, Ice and other agencies of violating rights by profiling street vendors, car-wash workers, day laborers and others, and making arrests without adequate cause – resulting in a temporary restriction against such enforcement in California and parts of the west coast.

But proving such fourth amendment violations can be a big burden on advocates, said Anthony. And Border Patrol has a long history of aggressive enforcement tactics.

“There’s evidence of everything from legal and constitutional violations to physical and sexual abuse and mistreatment, and very little recourse or accountability,” Anthony said. “Internal discipline within [the] Border Patrol is very problematic and that has been systematically the case for a long time now.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4393177562734795a7ba8e41914a5a7aabef8a5c/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2db8c1355a7c0bf17fc98c1f781a927b",N,,2025-10-12 11:57:20.110255

Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food.","Not long into his confinement at the sprawling immigrant detention center in Tacoma, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino heard swearing as dinner was served. “Hey, look at this,” said the man swearing as he brought his tray over for Juarez to see.

On it was chicken, normally the best food the Northwest ICE Processing Center has to offer, the Skagit Valley farmworker and labor organizer had been told. But on this day, the meat sat in a pool of blood. He inspected his own chicken and saw the same. He lifted the skin to take a closer look. “It was just raw,” he said.

“Everybody got mad and shouted that we weren’t going to eat this,” Juarez said. People returned their food to a cart. Close to 1 a.m., as he recalled, officers brought in sandwiches.

In March, the then-25-year-old had entered a world that, for many people, remains a mystery. The privately run detention center is one of the biggest such facilities nationwide, with 1,575 beds.

Advocates have for years called attention to conditions, collecting thousands of complaints from immigrants held there and submitting them to the state health department. Government agencies and human rights groups have written reports citing concerns. Immigrants locked up there have launched repeated hunger strikes, and some have tried to kill themselves. In 2018, one did.

But the low-lying gray building, surrounded by a chain-link fence, is rarely seen from the inside except by people who work there or are “detained.” Many people don’t even know what that word means, or how it differs from imprisonment. Even some who do would undoubtedly be surprised that one man has been held in ICE’s Tacoma facility for seven years.

More and more immigrants are learning about detention firsthand under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort. A record number are being held, nearly 60,000 nationally, according to the government’s September figures.

At Trump’s request, Congress has allocated billions of dollars to expand immigrant detention.

Already, the Northwest detention center’s surging population is putting a strain on the facility, exacerbating long-standing complaints and generating new ones, according to interviews with people currently and formerly held there, court declarations and accounts from lawyers and advocates. Many, like Juarez, tell stories of undercooked food and meals arriving in the middle of the night.

They also cite erratic access to outdoor recreation, little to no provided toiletries like soap, unclean uniforms and stained underwear, and long waits for medical care and legal visits. The atmosphere, they said, is tense amid new policies that offer little chance of getting out beyond being deported. Sometimes, even those ready for that outcome can’t leave quickly.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees the facility and provides its medical care, and the GEO Group, the Florida-based corporation running it since 2005, declined interview requests.

“False narratives about ICE detention facilities undermine the hard work of our dedicated professionals,” a spokesperson for the federal agency said in a statement. “ICE facilities operate under strict standards, including accreditation requirements for medical care and staffing.”

A GEO spokesperson said the company provides an array of services, including “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietitian-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.”

Those familiar with ICE’s Tacoma facility say it does not have the harshest conditions. Some detention centers operate in remote locations far from attorneys, lawyers and outside observers, said Michelle Brané, formerly the immigration detention ombudsman for the Biden administration. “They’re really running in the shadows.”

On one occasion, an asylum-seeker asked to be transferred there because he heard it was one of the better detention centers.

“I would say that it is fairly typical,” Brané said of the Tacoma facility, its problems endemic to the unique system it is in.

From cold holding cell to tense unit

Juarez, who had no criminal record, arrived at ICE’s Tacoma facility the way many immigrants do: in handcuffs, ankle shackles and a chain around his waist.

He had been stopped by federal agents early that morning as he was driving his partner to work picking Skagit Valley tulips, and taken first to a small, unmarked building, he recalled recently. It was 9 or 10 at night when he reached Tacoma and was placed in a crowded holding cell with others waiting to be processed. He met construction workers in dirty clothes they hadn’t yet changed out of, a father and son, and residents of Seattle, Eastern Washington and Portland.

The hours dragged on. “It was really cold and we couldn’t really sleep,” he said. They tried, on the concrete floor, with no blankets.

He was called out around 4 or 5 in the morning, given a blue uniform that signifies low risk, and placed in a two-tier residential unit. Some units have cells where groups of people sleep, but his was a large open area with bunk beds, Juarez said. The unit also had tables and chairs, a microwave, sink and three TVs.

One TV was always set to English-language programming, one to Spanish-language. Juarez, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, speaks both languages, but some people spoke neither, having immigrated from Russia, Turkey, Egypt and elsewhere. What to watch was a source of contention.

“There was always a high risk of a fight breaking out over the smallest thing,” Juarez said.

Still, the well-regarded labor organizer, whose detainment generated community outrage, said he got along with most everyone. He would buy instant ramen soup and macaroni and cheese from the commissary and share with those who didn’t have money.

Sometimes, he helped immigrants who had lost their cases write requests to be deported as soon as possible so they could get out of detention. One he recalled as waiting at least two months.

Days after Juarez arrived, an officer came into his unit with a list of people to be deported right away. Juarez’s name was on it. “Pack your stuff, you’re going tonight,” he said he was told.

Years before, a judge had ordered Juarez removed after he didn’t appear at a court hearing. Juarez said notice of the hearing had gone to the wrong address and he didn’t know about the removal order until he was detained. His lawyer, Larkin VanDerhoef, quickly filed a court motion that stopped him from being deported that night.

Months ticked by. “I started having vision problems because the lights were on pretty much 24/7,” some of them anyway, he said. He went to the “sick call” area one day, where immigrants line up starting as early as 5 a.m. to see health care providers.

There weren’t enough providers to see many of them, Juarez said. He went back to his unit and didn’t try again.

In July, after a judge declined to release Juarez on bond, he opted for “voluntary departure” to Mexico. He lives there now, hoping to find a way to come back to the U.S.

“Stuck in quicksand”

A paradox defines the detention system. It is part of a civil system that’s supposed to be, as ICE says on its website, “non-punitive.” Yet, it operates like a jail or prison system, an Obama-era ICE official noted in a 2009 report.

The Trump administration, which consistently portrays detained immigrants as dangerous, apparently sees no contradiction.

To be sure, some detained immigrants have committed crimes, including entering the country illegally. But whatever punishment they receive in the criminal legal system is intended to be separate from detention, which ICE standards say exists “for no purpose other than to secure their presence both for immigration proceedings and their removal.”

An array of immigrants without formal legal status in the U.S. can be detained, including people who overstay visas (which is not a crime) and asylum-seekers who entered the country without breaking any laws. In some cases, lawful residents with criminal convictions have also been held by ICE.

At the Tacoma detention center, roughly 60% of those reported in September ICE records as being held were categorized as noncriminal.

Despite similarities, detention and criminal incarceration differ in key ways. Those confined to prison have a fixed sentence. Those detained do not.

“It could be three days. It could be three years,” said Brané, the former ombudsman.

Some might be whisked away using a fast-track removal process the Trump administration increasingly deploys. Others are held until a judge or administrative body issues a final ruling on whether they can stay in the U.S. Huge backlogs impede the immigration court and appeals system, adding to the uncertainty of how long detention stretches on.

“It’s like you’re stuck in quicksand,” said Javier Martinez.

Martinez is the man who has been held at the Tacoma detention center for seven years.

The 44-year-old has applied to stay in the U.S. based on what he says is a fear of torture should he be deported, in part for political reasons. His case is complicated, involving two countries he could be deported to, Costa Rica, where he was born, and Nicaragua, where he is a citizen.

While his case has gone through multiple levels of review, he has tried and failed to get bond through every legal avenue, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Once a lawful resident, Martinez’s biggest stumbling block has been two cocaine distribution convictions before ICE took him into custody.

He served prison time for those convictions, offering him a point of comparison. In prison, Martinez earned a GED, obtained a waste management certificate and took parenting classes.

Martinez has found no such activities in detention, designed for comparatively short stays. “Sometimes, I just sit there and I feel like a vegetable,” Martinez said. Even getting to walk around or play sports outside has been tough lately. “Sometimes we have yard and sometimes we don’t,” he said.

He attributes that, as well as irregular meal times that have him going to bed hungry rather than waiting for dinner, to insufficient staffing.

After a steep decline in population due to COVID and slowed immigration enforcement, the detention center’s population has roughly doubled since January, according to immigration lawyers who regularly visit and ICE figures provided to the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Other detained immigrants said it’s patently clear the Tacoma facility is short-staffed. In a lawsuit on behalf of five immigrants held there for more than six months, plaintiff Jesus Bento Cardozo said in an April declaration that one officer frequently oversees two units. “The guard typically goes back and forth between two units and is sometimes gone for as long as 45 minutes or an hour. I worry that something bad could happen.”

As the only person in his unit to speak Konkani, an Indian language, Cardozo also said in his declaration: “I feel very isolated here.”

In Martinez’s particularly low periods, he has turned to a chaplain at the Tacoma facility.

“He’s a great guy,” Martinez said. “You can request to have a one-on-one with him, or a prayer session with him and he will come to the unit.” In a separate area, volunteers lead religious services.

But Martinez may have reached his limit on how much detention he can take. He is now considering an agreement to leave the U.S.

Detained while pregnant

In recent months, Martinez has noticed a new level of despair among those detained with him.

Until several years ago, many stood a decent chance of getting bond in Tacoma’s immigration court located within the detention center, but that changed as judges started automatically denying release to most immigrants who entered the country illegally. A U.S. District Court in September ruled the practice unlawful, and the federal government — which in July made the practice a nationwide policy — has indicated it will appeal.

In the past, ICE refrained from taking some people into custody for humanitarian reasons. A Biden-era policy, for instance, directed ICE officers to refrain from detaining pregnant, postpartum and nursing immigrants in most circumstances. ICE’s website notes the policy “is not reflective of current practice.”

Alejandra Gonza, executive director of a human rights legal group called Global Rights Advocacy, said she knows of three pregnant women who have been recently held at ICE’s Tacoma facility.

One, Anelys Garcés Infante, was taken there in July. A Venezuelan asylum-seeker living at the time in Oregon, Garcés Infante, 27, said she had been arrested on a shoplifting-related charge and ICE officers took her into custody as she left a sheriff’s office.

After advocates and members of Congress from Washington and Oregon pressed ICE to release Garcés Infante, the agency did so in early October, allowing her to continue her immigration court case while living in the community. Her lawyer, VanDerhoef, who also represented Juarez, said it’s the first grant of a procedure known as humanitarian parole he is aware of under the Trump administration.

Seattle midwife Amanda Heffernan visited Garcés Infante at the detention center and contributed to a release request supported by Seattle University’s International Human Rights Clinic and Global Rights Advocacy. “She walked in and I was like, oh my goodness, this person looks really thin and really sick,” Heffernan recalled in an interview.

Garcés Infante had been nauseous, throwing up and losing weight. Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food. The extra sandwich she got because she is pregnant, bolognalike meat on white bread, was so unappetizing she didn’t eat it. The meals she got relied heavily on beans, which don’t agree with her stomach.

“I just don’t feel good here,” she said in Spanish.

She worried that her baby or babies — an early ultrasound indicated she may be carrying twins — would be malnourished.

She received prenatal vitamins and medical care in detention, and said the doctors there treated her well. The facility called an ambulance to take her to the hospital when she was experiencing severe pain, Garcés Infante said. The hospital gave her medication.

But in Heffernan’s opinion, Garcés Infante needed more specialized care, especially because of possible twins, than detention offers.

Where’s the oversight?

Inspections by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman during previous administrations often haven’t fixed problems but they have cataloged some. Among those cited in reports on the Tacoma facility over the past two years: medical understaffing, inconsistent suicide-watch checks and preventive health screenings, and foods stored years past their “best-by” dates.

That oversight is now shrinking. The Trump administration largely defunded the detention ombudsman’s and Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which investigates complaints. A legal challenge is ongoing.

Washington state’s Department of Health, which has received 2,800 complaints since 2023, is attempting to step in. It is backed by recent state laws explicitly giving the agency authority to conduct inspections.

“I have been shocked by the complaints that we hear,” said Lauren Jenks, a department assistant secretary. One of her top concerns is the drinking water, which more than 100 complaints to her department describe as strange looking, smelling and tasting.

The department believes there’s something wrong with pipes inside the building, which it could help fix. But GEO and ICE have long prevented state health inspectors from coming in, which is being litigated in court. (The litigation also involves the state Department of Labor & Industries, which the detention center has allowed in to conduct workplace safety inspections but would likely do so more frequently under state legislation challenged by GEO.)",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10082025_ICE_tzr_115243.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:41.485090

“Texas National Guard can stay in Illinois but can’t activate, court says. Here’s what to know about the unit.” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

Traditionally, Customs and Border Protection centers and ICE holding rooms were meant to hold detainees for initial short-term processing while agencies determined next steps: transfer to ICE facilities, release, or deportation.
New York, by contrast, has only one: the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia.
‘Like dogs' in ICE hold rooms Immigrants arrested by ICE in New York have faced similar conditions in temporary holding rooms.
Federal statutes and ICE standards guarantee access to legal counsel in ICE detention centers.","ALBANY - Packed into small concrete cells inside U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Oswego station, detained immigrants were falling asleep standing up or lying on top of each other.

With up to 30 people crowded in a 10-square-foot cell, the station had become the first holding site for nearly 60 workers detained in a September factory raid in the western New York town of Cato - one high-profile example among rising numbers of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests across upstate New York.

Inside, there were no beds, no showers and no hot meals delivered. Under prior presidential administrations, migrants weren't held there long - usually a few hours. But now, at least one migrant was confined in that station for a week, according to his attorney.

And while detainees languished inside the station, their attorneys were running into bureaucratic dead-ends.

Border Patrol officials refused to confirm where the detainees were being held or to allow their attorneys inside the stations. The clients' locations also did not show up in the online detainee locator maintained by ICE. Attorney Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer drove to county jails and the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility hunting for them, unaware that they were still in Border Patrol custody.

It would be days before she and attorney Jose Perez would pin down their clients' whereabouts. At that point, they had already been moved to facilities in other states.

This experience - once unprecedented - is now becoming common in New York. At border and immigration offices around the state, small cells and conference rooms intended for short waits are now being used to detain immigrants for days, forcing them to sleep on concrete floors, on benches or in chairs in spaces jammed with dozens of people.

The attorneys described cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions in the facilities and say immigrants are often unable to call family members or to get legal advice while in there. Several attorneys also recounted being unable to confirm with federal agencies that their clients were in fact detained in the locations, sometimes for days.

""Almost no one knows what's happening inside there,"" said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University specializing in civil rights and immigration. ""Pretty much the only people who go into the … cells at the Border Patrol stations are either working for the Border Patrol or the people who are detained.""

While the number of migrants crossing the northern border has fallen dramatically this year, Border Patrol is increasingly confining migrants, including children, for extended periods in their New York stations - with around 40% staying for more than three days in June, the Times Union found. This is despite the agency's own standards advising it should generally hold migrants for no more than three days before transferring, releasing or sending them back to their country of origin.

At the same time, thousands of immigrants picked up by ICE have also experienced long waits in small holding cells at immigration courts and field offices in New York City, Buffalo, Albany, John F. Kennedy International Airport and on Long Island this year, the Times Union found. ICE had a longstanding policy of not detaining immigrants in temporary hold rooms for more than 12 hours but, in June, the federal agency issued a waiver to extend the permitted stay to three days, ""absent exceptional circumstances.""

At Federal Plaza immigration court in New York City, over 600 migrants were detained for more than three days in temporary hold rooms in the first seven months of this year, ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Times Union shows. In the overcrowded holding rooms, there were no beds, no showers, no confidential legal calls and two small meals per day, according to a lawsuit filed in August. One man in his 60s remained there for more than two months, data shows.

Meanwhile, in Buffalo, at least 180 immigrants were detained in a temporary ICE hold room in an office building this year. Forty percent of them were confined there for more than three days.

ICE said it permitted longer stays in temporary holding rooms to ""manage the surge responsibly while upholding detention standards,"" emphasizing that the move was both ""lawful and necessary.""

""The waiver is a temporary tool to ensure order, continuity, and compliance during extraordinary circumstances - not an abandonment of standards,"" said Jason Koontz, an ICE spokesman. ""ICE operates these hold rooms and holding facilities in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody. These facilities are designed for short-term processing, transfer, and repatriation, with clear limitations and oversight.""

Border Patrol officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Why the holds are happening

Long waits in temporary facilities can largely be attributed to the nationwide surge in ICE arrests amid President Donald J. Trump's deportation campaign - and a lack of adequate space for the ensuing detentions, according to ICE, immigration attorneys and academics.

Koontz characterized this heightened volume of arrests and detentions as a ""direct result of individuals choosing to break the law"" and an effort by ICE to ""restore integrity"" to the U.S. immigration system following the administration of former President Joseph L. Biden, whose policies had triggered an immigration crisis when millions of migrants flowed across U.S. borders.

Traditionally, Customs and Border Protection centers and ICE holding rooms were meant to hold detainees for initial short-term processing while agencies determined next steps: transfer to ICE facilities, release, or deportation.

But the volume of detainees has left ICE with less available space in its long-term detention centers - the majority and largest of which are concentrated along the U.S. southern border in states like Texas and Louisiana. New York, by contrast, has only one: the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia.

In New York, the issue is particularly acute. The Batavia center has been full or near capacity for many months. In other states, ICE has contracted with private prison companies and county jails to house detainees; while detentions in New York's county jails have also skyrocketed, private prisons are illegal in this state.

Koonz noted that state and local sanctuary policies have also limited ICE's ability to contract with authorities in those areas for detention services.

Some advocates believe the rise in long detentions in temporary facilities stems from a federal ""strategy"" of overpopulating detention facilities, even with people who may have open cases or qualify for hearings, to ""intimidate them into giving up their rights.""

""Even if people aren't (immediately) deportable, they are subjecting them to such harsh conditions that they're hoping that they will just choose to leave,"" said Jessica Maxwell, executive director of the Workers' Center of Central New York. ""It's a tactic.""

‘Bare bones' Border Patrol cells

The three-day time frame for Customs and Border Protection detention is a guideline, not a law or regulation. Across multiple presidential administrations, CBP has held migrants for extended periods - primarily along the southern border - with hundreds of children apparently held in custody for more than a week at times under the Biden administration, when crossings were especially high.

Nevertheless, detentions of this length used to be rare in New York. That's changing.

In June, the number of people detained by CBP for longer than three days included 74 migrants along the Buffalo border sector and 47 migrants along the Swanton sector, CBP data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Times Union shows. Since 2013, Buffalo had typically seen between two or less such detentions, and Swanton fewer than 15. In both sectors, the June numbers amount to nearly 40% of people held longer than CBP's benchmark.

Exhibits filed by Customs and Border Protection in federal court recently also showed seven children detained by the agency for more than three days in June in the Buffalo and Swanton sectors, and 12 in July.

CBP has New York stations in Niagara Falls, Buffalo, Wellesley Island, Oswego, Rochester, Erie, Massena, Ogdensburg, Malone and Champlain, divided between these two sectors. The Swanton sector also includes Vermont.

Unhygienic and overcrowded conditions in CBP facilities have been well documented for years, and advocates familiar with recent detentions in western New York say those conditions are more severe than ever - ""unlivable,"" according to Claire Molholm, a staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union.

""There is no bedding. They are forced to sleep on a concrete bench basically,"" said Matthew Borowski, an attorney whose clients have been held at Border Patrol stations in Tonawanda and elsewhere. ""They get something like a peanut butter sandwich with chips, not real food. … It's small and bare bones.""

A nursing mother detained at the Wellesley Border Patrol station told Maxwell's team that nobody working on-site could speak Spanish to communicate with the detainees, so they asked her to translate for them. Without adequate medical care at the station, Border Patrol officers had to drive the woman to a hospital in Watertown, which is nearly 40 minutes away, because her breasts were engorging painfully due to separation from her baby, she told legal aides.

In contrast, long CBP detentions have declined in southern border sectors in Texas and California, where such detentions used to reach thousands per month, but recently have dipped to the low hundreds. But the data shows that other sectors along the northern border - Detroit, Michigan, Montana and Maine - saw swells akin to New York.

‘Like dogs' in ICE hold rooms

Immigrants arrested by ICE in New York have faced similar conditions in temporary holding rooms. Some are waiting five days or more in these spaces, data shows.

{ ""__type"": ""devHubFreeformEmbed"", ""__id"": ""Datawrapper"", ""__fallbackImage"": ""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nWaQ6/mobile.png"", ""__data"": { ""datawrapper_id"": ""nWaQ6"" } }

Children are among those subject to long stays in facilities not designed for overnight detention.

In June, 24 children were held in ICE's New York City holding room for more than three days, five kids in Buffalo and one in Albany, according to an exhibit the federal government filed last month in connection with a lawsuit challenging its detention policies that's pending in U.S. District Court. In July, 10 children experienced holds longer than three days in New York City, one in Albany and one in Buffalo.

In Buffalo, many immigrants have been detained in ICE's field office, located on the seventh floor of a modern office building that includes a hotel and retail shops.

Perez said before Trump's second term began in January, clients would wait there for three to four hours, but now it is three to four days.

""They are waiting in a conference room,"" he said. There are no beds, no showers and no calls permitted. ""For food, they just get some snacks, not proper food.""

Men, women and children are all confined together there, he said.

Nearby, at the 650-bed Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, the facility is so crowded that in September, roughly 75 to 100 detained men slept on gym mats and mattresses on the floor of the gymnasium, according to a man detained in Buffalo Federal Detention Facility. He asked not to be named due to his ongoing detention. The immigrants all share one toilet, he said. He surmised some might have been there for days or longer.

Justice for Migrant Families, a Buffalo-based organization which regularly works with immigrants in that area, had never heard of those conditions under prior administrations, said Executive Director Jennifer Connor.

At ICE's Malta office, near Albany, detained immigrants can access their phones, personal belongings and landline telephones while supervised by officers in the holding area, according to an attorney who visited the space but requested not to be named to protect their clients' cases. The space also contains three lockable, cell-like rooms with no furniture and just a toilet inside.

In New York City, ICE detains 50 to 90 people at a time in the four holding rooms located on the 10th floor of the Federal Plaza immigration building, according to the class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of people detained there.

The detainees sleep on concrete floors, are fed small rations of food twice per day, are subject to extreme hot and cold temperatures and have been denied prescription medications, the lawsuit alleges. They must use a toilet in the holding room with no privacy, wear the same clothes and are denied items like soap, toothbrushes, menstrual products and the opportunity to bathe.

""Look how we are like dogs in here,"" said an immigrant detained by ICE in one of Federal Plaza hold rooms in a video he filmed there in July that was published by the New York Times.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is representing the Department of Homeland Security in the lawsuit, wrote in August that people held in the rooms have access to medical care, hygiene products, can call attorneys on a landline phone and are issued a change of clothes upon request. People in custody are typically fed two meals per day, a filing confirmed.

The office wrote in August most individuals are transported to other facilities within three days, ""except in exceptional circumstances."" Data shows from January to late July, 14% of waits at that holding room were longer than three days.

In September, a judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent ICE from overcrowding holding rooms and requiring them to provide bedding mats, hygiene materials, confidential calls to attorneys and space that is cleaned three times per day.

‘Legal black holes'

Temporary detention facilities pose several limitations for detainees in contrast to standard ICE centers, according to advocates. A major one is restricted access to legal counsel.

""At least there are some protocols,"" Maxwell said, regarding ICE centers and jails. ""It's clear how you make a phone call or when you get your phone access. None of that exists in these other places that are more makeshift and temporary.""

For one, it is much harder for the public to track individuals in CBP custody. Those detained for less than 48 hours do not appear in ICE's online detainee locator database, making it difficult for attorneys and family members to find them. Even after Kelley-Widmer's clients from Cato appeared in the locator, it only showed them as being in CBP custody, without information about where they were being held.

According to Albany-based immigration lawyer Matthew Geiling and New York Immigration Coalition Legal Director Rosanna Eugenio, the overlap in law enforcement agencies involved in immigration now - ICE, CBP, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and local police - often makes it difficult to even determine who has custody of a person.

Kelley-Widmer's experience is a common one, according to Eugenio, who said that CBP often refuses to confirm whether someone is in its custody.

""Essentially, that's just kidnapping,"" she said. ""When (we) don't know where the person is and you won't tell us, what is the recourse for that person's family member or their attorney or their community?""

Even when attorneys can locate their clients in detention, they are typically barred from meeting with them inside CBP stations - a longstanding practice that lawsuits have alleged is turning the facilities into ""legal black holes"" that leave detainees ""incommunicado"" with the outside world. That was the case for Kelley-Widmer and Perez.

Federal statutes and ICE standards guarantee access to legal counsel in ICE detention centers. CBP has argued, however, that these requirements do not apply to their detainees because of a federal regulation that excludes inspections at ports of entry from the right to legal counsel.

And once detainees are transferred to other states, attorneys like Kelley-Widmer are no longer able to represent them in certain matters because they are not licensed in those states.

She and her team at the Cornell University clinic are still working with one Cato client because they are co-counseling with a Texas attorney. For most detainees, however, the transfer effectively ends their legal representation, as they struggle to find new counsel - especially pro bono lawyers - in other states.

""If they cannot access supports such as loved ones and attorneys, they are very likely to accept the pressure to sign documents agreeing to their deportation,"" she said.

As of early October, Maxwell said at least 10 of the Cato workers had been deported.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aJ41Ckixai6v7yrPMwpNuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/albany_times_union_471/f57e851423b0e2829be37d69c0a19276,N,,2025-10-12 12:58:10.658686

Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs.
The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls.","The fragrant steam rose from the plates of pasta like mist from a hot spring as the famished Venezuelan newcomers lined up to eat on a frozen Chicago November afternoon in 2023. Many arrived in shorts and flip-flops.

I had partnered with local restaurateur Eldridge Williams to help feed and clothe the group, who had been bused up to my hometown along with other “sanctuary cities” run by Democrats by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas as part of an inhumane political stunt. Chicagoans stepped up to aid these people in need.

It was a strain, as Mr. Abbott knew it would be. The newly elected mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, had to reallocate already tight resources to help. Much of the responsibility of providing for the Venezuelans ended up being shouldered by Chicago’s Black community: Shelters were placed in our neighborhoods, and services were diverted away from our most vulnerable.

The apparent chaos of these arrivals, hyped by the right-wing media, helped re-elect Donald Trump. And it led directly to what happened this past week, when the federal government began treating my city like enemy territory. Rappelling out of helicopters like in a scene from “Black Hawk Down,” federal agents raided an apartment building in the predominantly Black community of South Shore, knocking down doors, separating children from their zip-tied parents and detaining people barely clothed.

Many people in Chicago assumed the targets of this action would be limited to immigrants, some of whom were, according to Trump administration officials, engaged in criminal activity. But the effects rained down on Black citizens who were caught up in the raid, too. Some Black Chicagoans expressed indignation and disbelief at seeing us be brutalized by Mr. Trump’s deployments, with one young brother exclaiming as he watched federal agents appear to choke a Black man on the street, “Ya’ll supposed to be choking Mexicans.”

At its heart, his comment speaks to Mr. Trump’s success in dividing us from one another and our humanity: a nagging devil on the shoulder of struggling Americans barely scraping together the rent and telling them someone else is to blame. It also reflects the divisions within the African diaspora, where it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that—like my own father—many Black people are also immigrants, experiencing their own traumas at the sight of these cruelties.

I visited the apartment complex on 75th Street and South Shore Drive after the raid. A friend of mine who is a journalist, Maira Khwaja of the Invisible Institute, had been one of the first on the ground and warned me of the wreckage that had been left behind by the mayhem, but seeing it in person was shocking. Tension loomed in the air even days later. A child’s soiled pink unicorn toy seemed to cry out for help beneath a broken headboard and an uprooted mattress. My heart breaks for the lessons of worthlessness being taught to these children.

Conversations with the victims of ICE’s South Shore raid reveal a people divided. One man expressed love for his new Venezuelan neighbors, one of whom helped him fix his car. Others burn with contempt, like a hot coal in weathered hands. These are hands that all too often can’t find work and are perfectly primed for pointing the finger. “I don’t agree with how they did it, but they needed to get them out,” said one disgruntled neighborhood resident.

And I get it: Not long ago, I welcomed a friend home from prison with the help of Gov. JB Pritzker. I was hopeful he’d be eligible for subsidized housing through the state’s re-entry programs, only to find that many of the opportunities had been siphoned off to the Venezuelan immigrants, and nothing was available. A crisis of conservative design, this desperate scramble for scarce resources is a rife breeding ground for ethnic animosity.

The reality of the Black American experience is that being at the heel of a racially unjust society means that the oppression of anyone invariably affects us.

Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs. This is the city of the disgraced detective Jon Burge, who, after leaving the military police, joined the Chicago Police Department and deployed what have been likened to military black sites to torture what has been estimated to be over 100 Black men in the 1970s to early ’90s, causing the city to pay out over $100 million in settlements. After Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014, protests erupted downtown over his death. Then, after George Floyd, as in other cities full of people fed up with police brutality, many of us took to the streets. Some protesters vandalized property in that heated moment.

The question now is: How will Chicago’s residents respond? The protests started small, but as the stakes of the federal incursion ramp up, with Mr. Trump ordering Department of Homeland Security agents in and attempting to deploy the National Guard as well (which has been blocked, for now, by the courts), the crowds have gotten bigger and the mood more defiant. The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls. All of this could eventually provoke peaceful demonstrators into revolt, which would also turn Chicago into the “war zone” Mr. Trump and his administration keep saying our city is, as a justification for his sending in his forces in the first place.

In Season 7 of Showtime’s “The Chi,” a show on which I appear as the character Jamal, there’s a moment when he’s shot in an attack meant for someone else and he has to wrestle with how to respond. In my creative exploration for the role, I contemplated the enormous weight of forgiveness and restraint. I sat in silence with Jamal’s gnawing, burning urge for revenge. I thought of the damage and the destruction it would do to his family, to his younger sister, who was left abandoned during Jamal’s previous incarceration. And ultimately, for the greater good of himself, and his loved ones, my character decided against it.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12mensa-mkfh/12mensa-mkfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:32.172199

On the immigration front, ICE raids and National Guard deployments have sparked outrage and further litigation.
As the nation braces for the next wave of protests and legal battles, one thing is clear: the struggle for the soul of American democracy is far from over.","Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by a series of extraordinary and controversial moves that have left the nation’s democratic institutions under strain and sparked a groundswell of opposition across the country. In recent weeks, the former president has ramped up his use of executive power, targeting political adversaries, deploying federal forces to American cities, and facing a mounting wave of legal challenges and public protests. The events of early October 2025 encapsulate the high-stakes battle now raging between Trump’s administration and defenders of the rule of law.

According to Publisher's Roundup, Trump has increasingly relied on extraordinary powers—pressuring allies to prosecute perceived enemies and using the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to suppress peaceful demonstrations. These actions, the publication argues, are not signs of strength, but of deep insecurity and mounting weakness. “Trump’s abuse of power is a sign of his insecurity and weakness, and it is setting up massive, peaceful, lawful opposition,” the article contends.

The legal front has been especially active. Over 150 court cases have been filed as part of democracy litigation efforts against Trump’s administration, with several recent victories for opponents. As reported by The Atlantic, this wave of litigation has become “the anti-Trump strategy that’s actually working.” In particular, Trump’s push to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on what critics call “unmerited charges” has drawn national attention. This follows the similarly controversial indictment of former FBI Director James Comey just a week earlier. Legal experts, including Richard Painter and Virginia Canter, have already filed multiple ethics complaints against the administration, and more may be on the way.

Meanwhile, Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and ICE agents has faced fierce resistance. In Chicago, at least three court orders have halted aspects of the administration’s activities in the city, as reported in early October 2025. Federal Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, warning that the administration’s arguments “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power—to the detriment of this nation,” according to Zeteo. When the Trump administration attempted to send hundreds of National Guard troops from California and Texas to Oregon and Chicago, Judge Immergut broadened her order, stating the effort was “in direct contravention” of her decision.

These legal setbacks have been accompanied by a collapse in Trump’s popularity. As Publisher's Roundup notes, “Trump is at historic lows in popularity at this early point in his term.” The American public, by and large, disapproves of the prosecution of Trump’s opponents, the aggressive use of federal forces, and the chaos that has come to define his administration. The electoral consequences have been dire for Trump’s party: Democrats have won or outperformed in 42 of 43 elections held in 2025, signaling a potential sea change in the political landscape.

Public protest has surged to levels not seen in decades. The No Kings protests, which first swept the nation in June 2025 in response to Trump’s military deployments in Los Angeles, are set for a second coast-to-coast iteration on October 18. With planned National Guard deployments in Portland and Chicago, and a recent deployment in Memphis, millions of Americans are expected to take to the streets. Political scientist Erica Chenoweth’s research suggests that when 3.5% of the population stands against a tyrannical regime, it cannot continue—a threshold that activists believe is within reach.

Press freedom has also come under intense pressure. Both independent and mainstream media have become more outspoken in their criticism of the administration. The New York Times ran a headline reading, “Letitia James Indicted After Trump’s Pressure Campaign,” signaling a break from its traditional neutrality. Meanwhile, journalists and civil society groups in Chicago have sued the Trump administration, alleging a “pattern of extreme brutality” by federal agents at protests, aimed at silencing both the press and civilians. A federal judge recently issued a 14-day order prohibiting federal agents from using physical force or arresting journalists in Chicago without probable cause, and restricting the use of riot control weapons.

Political leadership, particularly among Democrats, has become more unified in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian tactics. State attorneys general, governors, and national party leaders have coalesced to resist efforts to strip health care from millions and oppose government shutdowns. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have been credited with winning the messaging war during the ongoing government shutdown, making clear that Democratic votes would not be used to undermine essential services.

Yet, the administration’s aggressive posture persists. On social media, Trump has called for the removal and even jailing of political opponents, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Pritzker fired back, calling Trump “unhinged,” “insecure,” and a “wannabe dictator,” and declared, “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.”

Trump’s foreign and domestic policy moves have also drawn scrutiny. Despite claiming credit for a ceasefire in Gaza and angling for a Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian committee passed him over in 2025—a development that set off a storm among his supporters. Meanwhile, the administration has conducted strikes on alleged drug boats in international waters, with legal experts warning that the Department of Justice’s classified opinions grant the president “such extraordinary powers that he alone can decide to prosecute a war far broader than what Congress authorized after the attacks on 9/11,” according to CNN.

On the immigration front, ICE raids and National Guard deployments have sparked outrage and further litigation. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order barring federal immigration agents from using city property, stating, “We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority.” Anti-ICE protests have erupted in Chicago, Portland, and other cities, as activists decry what they see as unconstitutional crackdowns on ordinary Americans.

Within the federal government, the Trump administration has initiated mass firings, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announcing that “Reduction in Force” notices have gone out, though it remains unclear which agencies are affected. The government shutdown has exposed further fault lines, as the administration considers withholding back pay from some furloughed federal workers—a move not seen since the 1960s.

Against this backdrop, the fate of American democracy hangs in the balance. While the damage wrought by Trump’s policies—both at home and abroad—is undeniable, the resilience of legal institutions, the press, political leaders, and ordinary citizens has become a defining feature of this tumultuous era. As the nation braces for the next wave of protests and legal battles, one thing is clear: the struggle for the soul of American democracy is far from over.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/LeVuIBso68J7lUCWRIV9OVeBc1k=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2Fcc342760-fe2e-4045-ae1a-85b5e5596075.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 11:57:33.089743

But after approaching Illinois State Police officers standing outside the facility, the group’s communion request was rebuffed.

The processing facility has been at the center of ongoing demonstrations in recent weeks. About 11 a.m., protesters marched down Lexington Street toward the center, praying and singing.

Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Jason Bradley called the facility with the religious leaders’ request to give communion. Bradley said ICE denied the request.

Bradley said no reason was given for the denial.

ICE didn’t immediately return a request for comment on why the request was denied.

About 1,000 members of Chicago-area parishes and of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership were part of the delegation.

When the leaders announced to the group that ICE had declined the request, people started yelling “Shame! Shame!”

The group had communion among themselves in the parking lot and street before dispersing to either walk home or board yellow school buses the organizers had rented to take people home.

The Rev. Larry Dowling, one of the priests holding the communion elements, said, “We’re just very disappointed because we simply wanted to bring the love of God and the presence of the Eucharist to these prisoners, which we had been allowed to do before all this stuff happened. So they’re basically rejecting us bringing the presence of Christ and the love of God.”

A spokesperson for the coalition pointed to the 2008 Access to Religious Ministry Act, which allows religious workers “reasonable access” to jails and people in immigration detention facilities to meet with those who wish to “consult about their spiritual needs.”

“ICE has completely shut down and [is] not allowing any ministers inside to provide communion and religious support for many weeks now,” said spokesperson Sarah Rand of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Rand was unsure whether any attempts by other groups had been successful.

Chuck Fitzsimmons led the singing during the procession along Lexington Street to the ICE facility.

“In one sense [the music] keeps up your spirits, but also it focuses us on the message that we are here as one, brothers and sisters all,” he said.

He said he was sad to not be able to share communion with the detainees. “However, these are the times and these are the morals, and I think we were prepared to be denied,” he said.

On Saturday, crews put up barricades in front of the fence that a judge ordered removed by Tuesday per state police orders, according to a crew person on site.

U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt issued a temporary restraining order Thursday ordering the removal of the fence outside the processing facility to be taken down immediately.

The fence, erected in September, was still up as of Saturday afternoon. Officials have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to take it down.

Before the clergy arrived, dozens of protesters had already gathered at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.

About 30 minutes ahead of Broadview’s 6 p.m. protest curfew, some protesters went onto 25th Avenue to heckle a vehicle full of federal agents. Police then declared an unlawful assembly and pushed protesters down the street. State and sheriff’s confirmed 15 arrests throughout the day. Protesters arrested earlier Saturday face charges including destruction of government property, aggravated battery to a police officer, mob action and resisting or obstructing an officer.

About 7 p.m. Illinois State Police retreated and protesters cleared the roadway as Illinois Department of Transportation made small adjustments to the barriers around the designated free speech zones along 25th Avenue and demonstrators largely dispersed.

The ICE facility is the site of ongoing and often tense demonstrations, with agents deploying chemical irritants and rubber pellets, since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up a deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m. and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d21b62f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7712x4402+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2Fa8%2F6fb987c244eb9fa51696a552be7f%2Fbroadview-101225-035.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:57:42.188328

On several occasions during that era, the federal government, over the objections of Southern governors, deployed federal troops to protect those exercising their constitutional rights.
Its military interventions in Chicago and in other targeted cities do not seek to maintain order and protect the constitutional rights of the vulnerable.
Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety.
He is also the editor of the book “A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America,” written by his father Harry Kalven Jr.","Where is the line between “democracy” and “fascism”? Since President Donald Trump’s return to power nine months ago, that question has been posed again and again in response to the latest affront to human dignity, common sense and/or constitutional norms committed by his administration.

Arguably, however, this is the wrong question in that it assumes there is some precise threshold beyond which we cease to be free. Those who have experienced fascist takeovers elsewhere warn that if we insist on a definitive answer to that question, we will only belatedly realize that the walls have closed in around us. The danger is that we will drift — disoriented, unmoored, bewildered — into the iron cage of tyranny.

While there may be no red line from which to take our bearings, recent events have pulled back the curtain on the nature and trajectory of the Trump regime’s fascist project. In their haste to exploit the murder of Charlie Kirk, Trump and senior members of his team have revealed their contempt for fundamental First Amendment principles. The president has ruminated about the possibility of making it a crime to criticize him. Multiple voices in the administration have demanded punishment for anyone who speaks of Kirk in less than reverential terms. Calling for a crusade against the forces of “evil” and “wickedness,” Trump’s chief of staff Stephen Miller has conjured a vast left-wing “domestic terror network.” Vice President JD Vance has said it is exemplified by the Nation magazine and the Open Society Institute founded by George Soros.

(Full disclosure: I am a Nation contributor and have been an Open Society fellow. So if you are curious about the face of terrorism, according to the administration, I’m your guy.)

The “us versus them” logic of fascism is voracious. We have seen the category of “the enemy within” rapidly expand from MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gang members to the majority of the population that dissents from the MAGA-certified state ideology.

What has been revealed in recent weeks is ugly but deeply familiar. We have seen it before, and we have seen effective resistance to it. What is critical at this juncture is to be clear about the nature of the threat. Even with a supine Congress and compliant Supreme Court, it is unlikely the administration could effectively repeal the First Amendment by turning seditious libel (criticism of the government) and blasphemy into crimes. Rather, it has adopted a transparent strategy of seeking to provoke civil disorder in order to justify crushing dissent.

Sixty years ago, my father Harry Kalven Jr., a constitutional scholar, coined the term “heckler’s veto” to describe a situation in which those hostile to a speaker’s message seek to suppress it by threatening disorder. If the police restore order by silencing the speaker, they give the heckler a veto over public discussion. Censorship is thus achieved by a circuitous process.

The context in which my father developed the heckler’s veto concept was the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s, when those engaged in nonviolent protests against segregation in the South were often met by hostile crowds. Local authorities would then use the threat of disorder as a rationale for suppressing the protests.

On several occasions during that era, the federal government, over the objections of Southern governors, deployed federal troops to protect those exercising their constitutional rights. Among the photographs that illuminate that moment, one is especially telling: the image of 6-year-old Ruby Bridges entering a previously all-white elementary school, accompanied by U.S. marshals, while hostile white people jeer and heckle.

Today, the federal government is the heckler. Its military interventions in Chicago and in other targeted cities do not seek to maintain order and protect the constitutional rights of the vulnerable. Rather, at the direction of the heckler-in-chief, they are designed to provoke disorder that can then be seized upon as a rationale for declaring a state of emergency and suppressing dissent.

This theater of cruelty — masked federal agents terrorizing migrant families and brazenly attacking protesters and journalists — is not a matter of misconduct by the officers involved. On the contrary, they are delivering the message the administration intends to send.

In this respect, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement television commercial seeking to recruit local officers that has recently been airing in Chicago is revealing. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,” the ad declares. “Join ICE, and help us catch the worst of the worst.” The subtext is clear: Join us and be relieved of constitutional constraints and the nuisance of accountability. Enjoy impunity.

Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety. Similarly, declaring Chicago a sanctuary city is an expression of care for and solidarity with our neighbors. These civic aspirations are now under siege. In contrast to the federal interventions of the 1960s in support of those working to desegregate the Jim Crow South, we now confront a white supremacist regime seeking to undo the limited but real achievements of pluralism and tolerance.

While there is reason to hope that legal challenges to federal intervention and to ICE practices will ultimately prevail, it is important to recognize that we confront a rogue regime that has contempt for the rule of law and is in the process of building a massive paramilitary force answerable only to the president.

The terms of engagement are thus daunting. They are also clear. It is up to us all — elected officials, civil society, the press — to defend First Amendment freedoms by exercising them in the place where we live. Challenges abound: for protesters, to maintain nonviolent discipline; for public officials, to hold their ground in the face of economic retaliation; for police and military, to honor their oath to uphold the Constitution when given clearly unconstitutional orders; and for the press, to remain agile and work together to bear witness to events on the ground.

In meeting the moment, we can take heart from historian Hannah Arendt’s distinction between violence and power, which she saw as opposites. Power arises when people act together for a common purpose, as Chicagoans have been doing across the city by confronting ICE, providing legal and material aid to those targeted by the federal dragnet, and building networks for sharing information. Seen in isolation, these efforts may be small-scale and intensely local, but in the aggregate, they are building capacity for civil resistance. Violence, by contrast, is purely instrumental. It can destroy power but not create it. It is an expression of impotence. Only people acting in concert can generate power.

The great Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who was well acquainted with sectarian violence, said it best: “What looks the strongest has outlived its term. The future lies with what’s affirmed from under.”

Police records and bodycam footage indicated that Villegas Gonzalez quickly crashed into a parked delivery truck.","When Silverio Villegas Gonzalez was 12 minutes late for his shift at Tom & Jerry's Gyros, a diner on Chicago's northwest side, his manager knew something was wrong.

The short-order cook always let someone know if he was running late, even by just five minutes. Earlier that morning, Villegas Gonzalez, 38, had been fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, shortly after dropping his children off at a school and daycare in the suburb of Franklin Park.

The agents were attempting to arrest him as part of a massive immigration sweep launched by US President Donald Trump. Villegas Gonzalez was the Chicago crackdown's first casualty.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, after the 12 September incident, that Villegas Gonzalez was ""a criminal illegal alien"" with ""a history of reckless driving"", who steered his car at agents, causing one to fear for his life and fire his weapon, killing Villegas Gonzalez.

DHS told Reuters on Friday (local time) that it would conduct its own investigation into the incident, after the first agency that responded had finished its review.

Both Franklin Park police and the FBI responded to the shooting incident, but it wasn't clear which agency was investigating.

The FBI declined to comment, citing a lack of staff to respond to media inquiries, due to the government shutdown.

Franklin Park police did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

A reserved boy from Irimbo

Reuters interviews with family and coworkers, and a review of public records, present a more nuanced picture of a man who left his quiet village years ago for economic opportunity and worked long hours to support his children.

A man who had become sober after heavy drinking, resulting in liver disease, and who had become one woman's steadfast partner.

""He was so soft-spoken,"" said Ashley Alekna, manager of the diner, describing him as a kind, dependable presence during his 11-hour shifts in a kitchen full of boisterous personalities, making food for the crowds that spilled in from the community college across the street.

Villegas Gonzalez made a similar impression on partner Blanca Mora, when they were growing up in Irimbo, a small town in Michoacán, Mexico.

Mora said they were in their early teens, when they started greeting each other around town, meeting to chat on the corner near her grandparents' house.

People often leave Irimbo for opportunities beyond the tiny town, including Villegas Gonzalez's older brother, Jorge.

Jorge, who first went to the US in 1998, remembers his little brother watching him walk away.

""He was a kid,"" said Jorge. ""He hid, so I wouldn't see him crying.""

Father of two

In 2007, Silverio followed his brother north, part of a wave of more than 348,000 Mexican emigrants to the US that year, US Census data showed, as President Felipe Calderon's violent war against drug cartels deepened.

Villegas Gonzalez found employment in the restaurant kitchens, where - according to recent National Restaurant Association data - 46 percent of the nation's chefs and 31 percent of its cooks are foreign-born.

He met a woman and they had two sons. Jorge Villegas Gonzalez said his younger brother often struggled to cover the bills.

Between 2011-19, Villegas Gonzalez was cited for a handful of traffic offences, one for driving more than 48kmh over the speed limit.

He was also ticketed for driving an uninsured vehicle and having a broken taillight. He had no criminal record.

His abuse of alcohol during those years led to a diagnosis of liver disease, he told Alekna later. A doctor told him that, if he kept drinking, it would kill him.

He had been sober for more than a year when he died, co-workers and Mora said.

Mora and Villegas Gonzalez fell out of touch, when he moved to the US, but she eventually moved there too, looking for her mother, who had left Mexico to better support her three children years before.

She never found her mother, but she found love with the reserved boy from home. She visited him when he was sick and later the two became a couple. Villegas Gonzalez, his two sons, Mora and her 13-year-old daughter eventually all lived together in Franklin Park.

A family in Franklin Park

Mora said Villegas Gonzalez took his sons to the library three times a week, played with Lego and banned phones at the dinner table, so the newly blended family could focus on each other.

He began to open up to his co-workers, said Alekna, cracking little jokes throughout the day. When his younger son celebrated his birthday, they helped him bake a Minecraft video game-themed cake with green icing.

The morning he was killed, Villegas Gonzalez dropped his older son off at Passow Elementary School in Franklin Park and then his younger son at Small World Learning Center, just around the corner. Minutes later, surveillance video from a nail salon showed ICE agents pulling him over, each leaning into his front car windows.

Villegas Gonzalez backed up and tried to drive away, as the agent on the passenger side chased on foot. The agent on the driver's side was not visible, as Villegas Gonzalez drove forward.

In separate surveillance footage from another nearby business, what sounds like two gunshots can be heard around the same time. Police records and bodycam footage indicated that Villegas Gonzalez quickly crashed into a parked delivery truck.

A few hours later, Jorge Villegas Gonzalez was driving a minibus through the streets of Irimbo when he got the call that his brother was dead.

Villegas Gonzalez's two boys were taken to foster care, Mora said.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.
Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.
“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.
And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.","The national guard troops Donald Trump sent to Illinois can remain in the state and under federal control but can’t be deployed, an appeals court ruled on Saturday.

The appeals court granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments.

The decision to prevent the troops from protecting federal property or going on patrol comes after federal judge April Perry ruled on Thursday to temporarily block the national guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois as Trump continues his immigration crackdown in major cities across the US.

On Friday, Democratic US senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they had visited an immigration enforcement building near Chicago but were barred from going inside.

The senators stopped by the facility in suburban Broadview on Friday, requesting a tour of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility and to deliver supplies to protesters who have been demonstrating at the site for weeks.

Their visit coincides with a ruling that the fencing installed at the site must be taken down. A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street.

Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility.

“We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said.

“They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.”

“What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.”

The senators said they have congressional oversight authority.

“Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.”

To the south, in Tennessee, at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.

They also were at a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police”, the troops were escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.

Trump has sent or discussed sending troops to other cities as well, including Baltimore; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The federal government says the troops support immigration agents and protect federal property.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.

By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.

The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said the Trump administration had violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city.

In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing.

“Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote.

“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.

An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.

Lt Cmdr Teresa Meadows, a spokesperson for US northern command, said the troops sent to Portland and Chicago are “not conducting any operational activities at this time”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3369c14ac045b44fc198005afcd52efd994da41f/483_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae0103029435ab57fff1cde4f9139fb",N,,2025-10-12 02:56:40.876057

As the sun began to set, Illinois State Police tried to disperse the crowd, enforcing an executive order signed by the village's mayor to limit protesting hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

“We’re agitated by this restriction, by the way,” said Dr. Alli Muhammad, national leader of the Revolutionary Black Panther Party. “We feel that the mayor of Broadview, she considers herself an ally, but we’re not comfortable with this 9 to 6 curfew, so we’re going to present this cease and desist to remove the curfew.”

Earlier in the day, religious leaders marched from St. Eulalia Catholic Church in Maywood to the processing facility during a eucharistic procession.

Clergy members arrived, praying for the people detained and even attempted to serve communion to those inside but they were denied access.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin joined faith-based leaders and community members for a service at the church before the procession.

“I am here as an elected representative with this organization and these people to tell them what is going on.

Trump has previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon.
The US military said this week there were 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and 200 members of the Texas National Guard activated in the Chicago area.
""Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,"" Saturday's appeals court order said.
Officials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump administration, arguing the deployment was a ""grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty"".","A federal appeals court has ruled that US President Donald Trump's administration cannot deploy the National Guard in Illinois.

The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit also ruled that the force could remain under federal control for now.

The decision partially upheld a lower court ruling that blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area, which said it was ""likely to lead to civil unrest"" and ""only add fuel to the fire"".

Trump has previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon.

He has argued troops were needed to crack down on illegal immigration and crime, but local officials have filed lawsuits accusing him of exceeding his legal authority.

The US military said this week there were 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and 200 members of the Texas National Guard activated in the Chicago area.

""Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,"" Saturday's appeals court order said.

On Thursday, US District Court Judge April Perry granted a temporary restraining order blocking the troop deployment in Illinois.

The Biden appointee wrote: ""I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois.""

Officials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump administration, arguing the deployment was a ""grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty"".

Chicago has been a particular flashpoint since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz in September to detain and deport undocumented migrants.

Trump's September deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon is still being challenged in the courts.

Last week, it was blocked by Oregon District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term in the White House.

She wrote that the administration's justification for the deployment ""was simply untethered to the facts"".

In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell at-times violent protests over immigration raids in the city.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement.
During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.
“There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile.
Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz “Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.","A federal judge has ruled that a controversial security fence constructed around the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Broadview is violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land and ordered its removal.

In a ruling Thursday night, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt said it was clear from the government’s own arguments that “there is no plan to take the fence down and that ‘Operation Midway Blitz‘ currently has no end in sight.”

In addition, the judge said, ICE acting Director Todd Lyons wrote in a letter to the village that the agency has an issue with “unlawful assemblies” of protesters and there “will be no change in our operational posture” until the demonstrations stop.

“In other words, the (defendants’) current operations are indefinite and the protests — which Acting Director Lyons seemingly considers to fall into the category of ‘unlawful activities’ — will undoubtedly continue,” Hunt wrote in her opinion. “Under these circumstances, the court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon.”

The fence must be removed by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, the judge ordered.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a written statement the ruling was “a decisive win for public safety.”

“The judge’s decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview’s ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders,” Thompson wrote. “The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, decried “activist judges” and local leaders she says are attempting to stop lawful immigration enforcement.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “It is shameful that this is coming less than one week after the attack by domestic terrorists who rammed their cars into our DHS officers’ vehicles.”

The fence, she said, was extended only after “rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.”

The village of Broadview last week filed a motion for a restraining order requiring the removal of the 8-foot-tall fence, which was constructed around the temporary holding facility on Beach Street that has seen daily protests and federal agents using tear gas and other weapons on crowds.

During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.

“It is very charged, it is very challenging,” Hunt said. “There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile. But those issues are not before me.”

Attorneys for Broadview argued that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, constructed the fence “in the middle of the night without notice,” and that it not only physically deprives the village of its right to control its own land, but constitutes a public safety hazard by blocking emergency service personnel and vehicles from reaching several commercial and industrial properties located on the other side.

Lawyers for the government, meanwhile, said the village still has access to the area through a key-card gate on another street, and that complaints that the gate was too small for fire trucks did not hold water.

Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz

“Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.

Walsh said the government had “no other option” than to put up the fence because protesters were gathering day after day and accosting law enforcement outside the facility, inciting violence and slashing tires of ICE vehicles pulling in and out of a secure lot.

“This went on for weeks,” Walsh said. “If the fence comes down, it is very foreseeable that the same kind of violence is going to occur.”

Hunt pointed out the building had been there for 40 years without issue, yet no one seemed to have a plan for protesters once the Trump administration’s immigration push began.

The Trump administration said it had targeted more than 1,400 employees at the Treasury Department, and nearly 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, where notices started to reach some workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by late Friday.

The administration also proceeded with layoffs at the Commerce Department, the Education Department, the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the court filing, which indicated that the cuts at many of those agencies would range into the hundreds.

By seeking to oust civil servants during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, the president blamed Democrats, as he estimated that “a lot” of workers would be affected and asserted the layoffs would be “Democrat-oriented.”

The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals did, however, grant a temporary stay on a portion of U.S. District Judge April Perry’s order involving the federalization of the National Guard within Illinois.
“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the court order said.
“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.
“I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.” Gov.","A federal appeals court in Chicago on Saturday denied the Trump administration’s request for an emergency stay of a district judge’s order barring the president from deploying National Guard troops in the city and state.

The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals did, however, grant a temporary stay on a portion of U.S. District Judge April Perry’s order involving the federalization of the National Guard within Illinois.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the court order said.

The ruling keeps in effect Perry’s granting of a temporary restraining order Thursday halting President Donald Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard troops into the Chicago area to act as a security force during the administration’s controversial immigration enforcement action known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The Department of Justice argued in a filing Friday night that Perry’s order “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.”

The 20-page motion asked the higher court to freeze Perry’s order while an appeal is pending, saying the National Guard should be allowed to “protect federal personnel and property” while the litigation continues to play out.

In a response on Saturday, attorneys for Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Perry was correct in halting Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional plan to dispatch federalized troops to Chicago with no clearly defined scope of the mission, its duration, or any “provable factual underpinning.”

It was clear, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued, that “absent an injunction, the federal government could and would use the troops consistent with the unbounded scope of the federalization orders — that is, to assist any federal agency on any federal mission that is occurring anywhere in Illinois.”

The dueling motions were a clear indication that the legal battle over Trump’s National Guard plans is far from over.

Perry on Thursday blocked Trump from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

Trump has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as security, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, ”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

(AP) — The Trump administration is pushing again to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and hasn’t given up on moving him to Eswatini or Ghana even though both have rejected the idea, an immigration official told a judge Friday.

Abrego Garcia has challenged efforts to re-deport him to a third country after the government admitted that a previous order prevents his deportation to his home country of El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said recently that it plans to deport him to the southern African country of Eswatini.

WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorney discusses his case amid new deportation effort

The case has come to represent the bitter partisan struggle over the President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland will decide whether Abrego Garcia should remain in custody or be released from immigration detention while his challenge moves forward. She ordered government officials to explain the steps they have taken to remove Abrego Garcia to another country.

An ICE official told the judge during a hearing Friday that the government was continuing to talk with officials in Eswatini about sending him there even though the country rejected the idea this week.

He said his understanding is that the administration also was still in discussions with Ghana. However, Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, posted on social media Friday that the nation will not accept Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia could be removed within 72 hours if the judge allows it and once the administration receives approval from a third country, said John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who helps oversee removals for ICE.

“We could quickly operationalize the removal,” Schultz said.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have charged that the Republican administration is trying to illegally use the immigration system to punish him after the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

Meanwhile, attorneys in criminal court in Tennessee have made similar claims about retribution in the human smuggling charges brought against Abrego Garcia in June on the day he was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. The Tennessee judge has concluded that Abrego Garcia’s prosecution may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was not charged at the time, and agents did not begin investigating the stop until earlier this year after his wife sued over his deportation.

At a Friday hearing in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw said he will hear evidence on the motion to dismiss the charges on Nov. 3.

In addition, defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion asking that statements unrelated to the smuggling charges be removed from the indictment. Attorney Jenna Dabbs cited allegations that her client is a member of the MS-13 gang as an example of the extraneous accusations that are not relevant to the actual charges.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of MS-13, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

On Friday, the offices of commissioners Roger Garcia, Christ Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, and Brian Fahey detailed five points as to why they were rejecting the proposal.

""The true humanitarian choice is to not detain mothers, fathers, and workers who have no criminal record,"" said their response.

It went on to say the people who help Nebraska's economy shouldn't be detained if they have no criminal record.

The commissioners cited the Glenn Valley Foods raid in Omaha, saying most who were detained were ""hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here.""

They alleged that detaining those kinds of individuals deepens fear and negatively affects the state's economy.

Their third point is the cost to house someone at the jail, saying it costs about $220 per day, which exceeds the amount ICE is paying at other facilities.

""Real solutions require real reform,"" said the commissioners' response, claiming that what's needed is advocacy at the federal level.

In their final point as to why they were rejecting the proposal, the commissioners said that they do support jailing criminals but must protect those who are contributing to society and ""reflect the values we hold dear, such as faith, hard work, and hope for a better future for their children.""

Video obtained by CBS News Chicago showed agents interrogating and detaining drivers.

One Uber driver from Guatemala said he was eating lunch when agents walked up to him and asked him if he was a U.S. citizen. The driver said he was nervous but rebuffed the agents' request.

Of the 50,000 runners participating in the race, 3,000 are from Mexico – the largest contingent of runners from outside the U.S.

The Mexican Consulate in Chicago is among many organizations hosting a cheer zone along the marathon route.

""This year it feels different,"" said Reyna Torres Medivil, the Consul General of Mexico in Chicago.

The agency said it has received calls and emails from runners and their family and friends voicing concerns about ICE enforcement while they're in Chicago. The agency is telling people visiting from Mexico to have copies of documentation on their person.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, voiced his concerns this week over the U.S. policy of deporting migrants and asylum seekers to countries where they could face harm. He said the administration's approach is inconsistent with international legal principles designed to protect refugees.

""I am worried that the current debate, in Europe for example. and some current deportation practices, such as in the United States, address real challenges in manners not consistent with international law,"" Grandi said on Oct. 7, as reported by The Associated Press.

Grandi also criticized what he described as a growing disregard for international law among developed nations and emphasized that poorer countries continue to carry most of the global refugee burden. Speaking at the opening of UNHCR's executive committee, he urged world leaders not to use politics or nationalism as an excuse to dismantle long-standing protections for displaced people.

""Pressures to reform asylum are not made in good faith, but represent yet another attack on international solidarity, at the time when many countries continue to welcome refugees,"" Grandi said.

Grandi's warning comes as the U.N. refugee agency itself faces major setbacks. As a result of sharp U.S. funding cuts under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed in July, the UNHCR was forced to eliminate nearly 5,000 jobs this year — almost a quarter of its global workforce.

""This was certainly not an easy year for any of us,"" Grandi said.

A pattern of criticism from U.N. officials

This isn't the first time the Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from U.N. officials. In May, Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, raised alarms over the scale and conditions of U.S. deportations.

Türk said his office had received reports from lawyers and families alleging serious human rights violations, including lack of due process, arbitrary detention, and deportations that exposed individuals to torture or other irreparable harm.

""This situation raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both U.S. and international law,"" Türk said.

The U.N.'s warnings come amid a broader ideological clash. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, President Trump delivered a speech denouncing the U.N.'s ""globalist migration agenda,"" and called on countries to close their borders and expel foreigners.

""It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,"" Trump said, according to The Guardian. ""You have to end it now. Your countries are going to hell.""

The administration also claimed the global asylum system has been abused and needs to be overhauled.

In response to the criticism, U.S. State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott defended the administration's stance, framing Trump's remarks as a rejection of international pressure.

""Our actions are consistent with U.S. law and the will of the American people, who demand secure borders and a lawful immigration system,"" Pigott said. He added that Trump's U.N. speech was ""a call to action against the destructive policies promoting mass and illegal migration that globalist bureaucrats have pushed for years.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583820/us-president-donald-trump-speaks-united-nations.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:24.840431

She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.","The Trump administration has attempted to postpone at least nine challenges to its immigration policies during the government shutdown, including cases that could determine whether people can be held in detention centers without bail.

Federal judges have repeatedly said no.

In the detention-without-bail case, Judge Brianna Fuller Mircheff said that if the deportation apparatus is still running during the shutdown, an immigration-related challenge should continue too.

“Despite the government shutdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to remove noncitizens from the community; noncitizens continue to be detained under the policy that is challenged in this case; and immigration courts continue to process cases involving detained respondents,” the court’s order states.

“Given that individuals are continuing to be detained subject to the challenged policy, the Court declines to indefinitely stay adjudication of whether such individuals are lawfully detained,” it states.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the class action lawsuit in California against a July 8 policy change ending bond eligibility for people who have lived in the country for years but are in detention centers while their immigration cases continue.

It’s one of at least nine legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Department of Justice has sought to pause during the shutdown, which is now in its second week with no progress toward an end.

Most judges are insisting on keeping their scheduled deadlines, pointing to continued immigration enforcement and urgency of the lawsuits, which also include challenges against the end of temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s deportation and federal funding freezes for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Starting Oct. 1, the first day of the government shutdown, DOJ attorneys began approaching courts with requests to delay immigration-related proceedings as part of the department’s plan to limit civil litigation during the lapse in federal funding.

The DOJ shutdown contingency plan states that it will continue to deal with cases where the safety of human life or protection of property would be compromised significantly by a delay. It also states attorneys have to keep working if judges deny the department’s requests.

Some groups suing the government over immigration matters argue that there would be serious impacts to putting the cases on hold.

The case over whether the Department of Homeland Security can end temporary protected status for Venezuelans, for example, affects about 600,000 people directly and could have repercussions for others with these protections.

“It is important because it’s one of the only hopes with little possibility of continuing the protection for people with TPS,” said Jose Palma, a national coordinator for the National TPS Alliance, which is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over ending TPS for Venezuelans.

Palma said moving ahead with the legal challenge is particularly vital in light of a recent Supreme Court decision that allows the government to cut off deportation protections and work authorization for Venezuelans while the ultimate fate of TPS for the population is determined in lower courts.

The case is set to move forward in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel denied the federal government’s request to pause the case because of the government shutdown. However, a federal judge agreed to pause a similar case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts until the end of the shutdown.

Despite DOJ’s efforts to pause proceedings in the lawsuit seeking to stop the second deportation of Abrego Garcia, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland is requiring the DOJ to bring to a Friday hearing witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the steps the government has taken to deport him to Eswatini, Costa Rica or any other country.

During a hearing on Monday, Xinis lost her patience with the government attorneys’ inability to provide information about the administration’s plan to once again deport Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.

DOJ also failed to secure an indefinite pause in the lawsuit filed in February by several cities and counties over the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold funding for “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Santa Clara and San Francisco, along with multiple other counties and cities, have been granted preliminary injunctions by District Judge William Orrick twice, as the lawsuit has grown to include other counties, most recently at the end of August.

Following the most recent ruling, the Trump administration’s attorneys had a deadline of Oct. 16 by which they could respond, but on Oct. 1, they filed for a motion to stay, similarly citing the government shutdown as the reason for the need for an extended deadline.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the DOJ motion states.

Attorneys representing Santa Clara cited the DOJ’s own contingency plan in response, noting “the Department’s (contingency) plan assumes that the judicial branch will continue to operate, though possibly at a reduced level, through the lapse.”

Orrick promptly denied the motion to stay, and the administration has until the original deadline to reply to the ruling.

The judge’s motion “helps ensure that accountability doesn’t stop when it’s inconvenient for those in power,” said Jonathan Miller, the chief programs officer at Public Rights Project, which is representing some of the cities in the lawsuit.

“The federal government can’t use a shutdown as an excuse to halt oversight while continuing to pursue the policies we’re challenging,” he said.

My view is that Trump has been frustrated in the pursuit of his dictatorial ambitions through the use of the ordinary powers of the presidency, including by all of those court orders, and so he has turned to his extraordinary powers. They include improperly pushing his cronies to bring criminal prosecutions of his perceived enemies and deploying the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to crack down on peaceful protest–also wrongly.

These dual policing initiatives represent an outrageous overreach—the besetting sin of dictators, and one that often leads to their ouster. Make no mistake, Trump’s abuse of power is a sign of his insecurity and weakness, and it is setting up massive, peaceful, lawful opposition.

That includes more problems for Trump in litigation, recently recognized by The Atlantic as “the anti-Trump strategy that’s actually working”. That article reported on the success of my and my colleagues’ democracy litigation–the over 150 legal cases and matters that you Contrarians make possible through your paid subscriptions.

On the legal front, I wrote with Richard Painter and Virginia Canter this week about Trump’s push to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James with unmerited charges that match the similarly baseless indictment last week of James Comey. Team Trump is, in our view, headed for bumpy judicial waters in both cases, and the three of us have already lodged multiple ethics complaints, with more on the way. We also analyzed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and his use of ICE and the legal opposition that has occasioned—including no fewer than three court orders stopping various aspects of Trump’s Chicago activities this week.

Dr But his obstacles are deeper than the courts. As readers of this column know, most backsliding democracies make U-turns. The Trump regime is facing mounting opposition in all of the main dimensions that determine whether autocracy becomes permanently entrenched or whether democracy is poised to make a comeback.

I don’t want to sugarcoat the tremendous damage Trump is doing domestically and internationally and the lives that are being destroyed and even lost as a result. And not every backsliding democracy makes a U-turn. But when you look objectively at the landscape, there are ample reasons to believe Trump is not succeeding in his dictatorial ambitions. That goes well beyond the challenges that he is facing in court.

Trump’s Standing in and at the Polls

A majority of the American people do not like the prosecution of Trump’s adversaries, his deployment of the National Guard, his aggressive immigration processes, his role in shutting down the government to tear health care from millions and the rest of the chaos. No wonder Trump is at historic lows in popularity at this early point in his term.

The results at the polls this year have been similarly devastating. Democrats have won or outperformed in 42 of 43 elections this year. That is a reflection, in part, on Trump’s unpopularity–and augurs ill for the future for Trump’s party.

Public Protest

The size, number, and geographic distribution of protests against the Trump regime in 2025 have been off the charts. We have not seen anything like it in decades.

Now, we will have the second iteration of the No Kings protests on Saturday, Oct. 18. The No Kings protests in June saw a massive coast-to-coast turnout, driven by Trump’s initial National Guard and military deployments in Los Angeles. With Trump’s planned deployments in Portland and Chicago and the deployment in Memphis that started Friday, expect millions of Americans to show up, stand up, and speak out.

Political scientist Erica Chenoweth famously found that when 3.5% of the population stands against a tyrannical regime, it cannot continue (Contrarian Editor-in-Chief Jen Rubin argues it would take much less). We are well on our way to that number of peaceful, lawful protesters.

Press Pressure

In this category, I include both old and new media, including independent outlets like The Contrarian. We, of course, saw this coming from Day One and have been outspoken, but, in recent weeks, we have increasingly been joined by traditional media.

That includes perhaps the single most authoritative source in theUnited States, The New York Times, which has broken with its more careful neutrality in recent weeks. A case in point is its banner headline on the James prosecution: “Letitia James Indicted After Trump’s Pressure Campaign.”

Political Leadership

Experts also look at whether there is unified political opposition to a would-be dictator. The strong example initially set by state attorneys general has been followed in recent months by governors stepping up—and now national political leaders are succeeding in doing the same.

In this column last week, I noted that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and national Democrats were winning the shutdown messaging war by making clear that their votes were not available to strip health care from millions of Americans or make it prohibitively expensive. Another week has gone by, and their success has now become evident—recognized in poll after poll and in Republican disarray.

When you add all that up, there is cause for hope. Obviously, it’s too soon to say which path the United States will take and whether we will follow the majority of other democracies that have executed a U-turn following democratic backsliding. Trump and his enablers certainly are not slowing down, and the damage is vast and growing every day.

But if they are not stopping, neither must the friends of democracy—including you, Contrarians. Our rundown of all the week’s stories here at The Contrarian shows that Trump’s “flood the zone” continues to meet “rule of law shock and awe.” See for yourself…

Shutdown & Congress

How long can this last? April Ryan & Paul Osadebe on the true cost of the government shutdown

On a special edition of The Tea, April Ryan sat down with federal worker and organizer Paul Osadebe to talk about the real and worsening harms of the government shutdown. “This is crisis moment, guys.”

Democrats must stay on message with the shutdown

Norman Ornstein examined how congressional Democrats’ undisciplined messaging has hindered their impact in the past — and how the ongoing shutdown offers an opportunity to realign and strengthen their communication strategy. “When the shutdown ends, the responsibility for the healthcare catastrophe will be clear.”

Is Trump’s Overreach Starting to Fail? Senator Mark Warner with Jen Rubin

Sen. Mark Warner joined Jen to unpack the latest on the MAGA government shutdown, Trump’s notice of “armed conflict” to Congress, and the constitutional strength of our military. “The briefings we’ve got from the administration so far are not satisfying.”

Militarization, ICE and Chicago

We Found the ‘Enemy from Within’

Jen Rubin unpacked the unchecked cruelty of Trump’s troop deployments and ICE overreach, which prove daily that the “enemy within” is him and his lackeys. “ICE’s raid on a Chicago apartment building and the ensuing ICE violence against civilians make clear that Trump has initiated an unconstitutional, brutal war against ordinary Americans.”

Trump’s Fundamentally Anti-Democratic Immigration Strategy

On the Contrarian Podcast this week, Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-N.Y.) and immigration expert Aaron Reichlin-Melnick explained why Stephen Miller and ICE are doing anything but making Americans safer.

Dispatch from Chicago: This is not a ‘war zone’

Lorraine Forte shared her time with a local activist in Chicago fighting to restore her city after last week’s shocking military-style apartment raid and offered a look at the mood on the ground as the city braces for a National Guard deployment. “The city is still reeling.”

Jen Rubin and Ilan Goldenberg on the Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal

Ilan Goldenberg joined Jen Rubin on Thursday for a live discussion of the Gaza ceasefire deal—what’s in it, what’s not in it, and what’s likely to unfold next, along with the case for optimism. “Now is an opportunity.”

The UN and the Peril of Passivity

Roberto Valadéz wrote on the existential crossroads faced by the United Nations as the Trump administration demeans and defunds its vital work. Part of the way forward, he argued, is a stronger PR strategy. “The United Nations is not a failed project; it is an unfinished one.”

The Nobel Prize is about character, not headlines

Brian O’Neill analyzed Trump’s Peace Prize fixation, which reveals far more about him than about peace, and put forward far more deserving (and likely) candidates for this year’s honor. “Facts matter. So do deliverables.”

The Movie Iran Doesn’t Want You to See

Culture columnist Meredith Blake wrote on Jafar Panahi’s It Was Just an Accident, a film inspired by Panahi’s experiences as a political prisoner that began as secret iPhone footage and has since won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. “With the movie arriving stateside next week and the Iranian regime no doubt closely monitoring its reception overseas, we can only hope the acclaim becomes truly deafening.”

Will the ceasefire hold? Steven Cook on the feasibility of the Hamas-Israel peace deal

Middle East expert Steven Cook joins Jen to discuss the hopeful end of hostilities in a region that hasn’t seen peace in decades. Who knew it would take a transactional, American bully like Trump to convince Netanyahu to finally accept a deal?

Justin Wolfers joined Jen for a must-watch breakdown of the actual health of the economy under Trump—something the administration is doing its best to obfuscate. “We are flying blind right now.”

Trump’s blueprint for tyranny

Austin Sarat analyzed Trump’s “Compact for Excellence in Higher Education” as a blatant attempt to further control universities across the country—and a precedent for further attacks on freedoms far outside academia. “Think what I think. Do what I do. Or, else.”

DOJ & SCOTUS

Cold comfort: The DOJ says it stands with survivors, but words aren’t enough

Jacqueline Kelly and Mimi Rocah wrote on the DOJ’s hollow commitments to anti-trafficking efforts and victims of sexual crimes. By prioritizing political interests over justice, they argued, the Justice Department is jeopardizing the work of law enforcement to protect survivors.

If this isn’t vindictive prosecution, what is? Andrew Weissmann on James Comey criminal charges

Andrew Weissmann joined Jen to break down James Comey’s specious indictment, what his defense team may be planning, and Pam Bondi’s bizarre behavior. “This could blow up.”

Can our courts be reformed?

Lisa Graves, author of Without Precedent, joined Jen for an exposé on Chief Justice Roberts’ Supreme Court and its impact on law, policy, and democracy at large. “If you view this as a hyper-partisan court engaged in hyper-partisan activity for a hyper-partisan president, that’s what’s happening.”

At 11am I will try to live-blog, for @lawfaremedia.org , the hearing in Abrego Garcia’s civil (habeas corpus) case in federal court in Greenbelt MD. Abrego is seeking release from detention under a SCOTUS precedent called Zadvydas v Davis (2001). ... /1 tile.loc.gov

Meanwhile, in Abrego’s criminal case, a status conference is due to start at 9am CT/10am ET in Nashville TN over what sort of discovery to provide Abrego in pursuing his motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution. Unfortunately, we can't get someone there today. ... /2

Here in Greenbelt, we do not yet know if we'll hear live testimony or just oral argument. To keep Abrego detained, govt must show that Abrego faces a “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Here’s Judge Xinis’ order convening the hearing: /3

The Zadvydas issue involves these statutes, plus due process principles. Immigration laws (8 USC 1231a1 & a2) say an alien shall be detained for 90 days after his order of removal (“removal period”), & 1236a6 says that period can be extended in some cases. But ... /4

... in Zadvydas, SCOTUS held that there was a rebuttable presumption that the alien should be detained no more than 6 mos. The key is whether govt can show “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future. ... /5

... Abrego’s situation is a bit different. His order of removal was back in 2019 but he was released because he won “withholding of removal.” He was only re-arrested in March 2025. His attys say his 6-mos Zadvydas period” expired in early 2020. ... /6

... They argue basically (1) govt can’t show its really taking steps to remove him in the “reasonably foreseeable future” (in part because they’re keeping him for criminal trial) & (2) it could’ve taken steps to remove him during the 5 years he was free. ... /7

Though Abrego's attys were notified that govt planned to remove him to Eswatini (after 1st saying Uganda), at the last hearing govt attys could not even say whether Eswatini had yet been contacted. Today govt can present evidence of concrete steps its taken or is about to take. ... /8

There have also been recent reports that DHS notified his attys that now he'd be sent to Ghana, but that notice seems to have been rescinded. Doubtless we'll get the most up-to-date info shortly. ... /9 abcnews.go.com abcnews.go.com

DHS says notice about deporting Abrego Garcia to Ghana was 'premature' Looks like DOJ has brought at least one witness today, so we'll likely get testimony. /10

Plaintiffs attorneys at counsel table are Andrew Rossman, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Sascha Rand, Jonathan Cooper, & Olivia Horton. All are from the Quinn Emanuel firm excerpt Sandoval-Moshenberg, who's an immigration specialist who was Abrego's first lawyer after his 2025 arrest. /11

For DOJ I see Bridget O'Hickey (counsel to the Asst AG), Ernesto Molina, Jr. (deputy director of office of immigration litigation), and, I think, 2 others, but I can't yet ID them. /12

I suspect one of the other DOJ attys is Jonathan Guynn, who was here last time and whose name I misspelled then. (Regret the error.) He's a deputy assistant AG. (Molina is a career guy.) /13

Now getting warnings about electronic devices. (I'm in the media room.) /14

All rise. US District Judge Paula Xinis is on the bench. Attys giving appearances. Lead Abrego atty today: Andrew Rossman Lead DOJ: Jonathan Guynn. The DOJ atty I couldn't ID is Drew Ensign. /15

There's one other Abrego atty present i didn't mention before: Rina Gandhi. Govt witness is apparently John Schultz of DHS. Judge is speaking at sidebar (at the bench) with one lawyer from each side, apparently about how to conduct the hearing today. /16

S: spoke to Mursky about Eswatini 2 days ago. Wednesday morning about the immediate case right now ... they had not pursued further discussion J: you spoke to anderson this morning? /36

[sorry lost some frames important frames in there] He said discussions were ongoing but Eswatini had not yet agreed to receive Abrego, even if injunction was lifted.] /37

S: if injunction is dissolved, we will remove him to eswatini. G: what's your understanding of state's attempts to find additional host countries if plan to remove him to eswatini does not receive. S: also in discussions with Ghana. /38

G: has US ID'd Ghana as country he'll be sent to S: not at this time. a notice was prematurely sent to him. G: why? S: field office just trying to get ahead of things so if ghana did say yes removal would be quicker. G: if court dissolved injunction , how long would it take to remove him /39

objection--foundation G: do you have experience finding alternate 3d countries to remove aliens? S: [didn't underestand answer] haven't been involved where first 3d country fell through. ICE asks State for assistance. If country A says no, they pivot to B, i don't have visibility on country A /40

G: if court dissolved injunction, how confidetn arew you ICE could remove him to a 3d country in next 2 or 3 weeiks. S: confident we could remove him quickly. within 72 hours. Judge asks counsel to bench again. /41

[Sorry, I dont know what happened with a fairly crucial frame above. But Guynn seemed a little surprised that Schultz could not say that Eswatini would accept Abrego if the injunction was lifted. At Judge had taken over the questioning at that point. Guynn tried to interrupt, but in vain.] /42

Houston: Missing teen in immigration custody

The backstory:

The teen was reported missing after he was last seen Saturday afternoon near the intersection of Clay Road and Hempstead Road in Spring Branch.

FIEL, an immigrant-led civil rights organization, helped the boy's family put out a call for help during a press conference on Friday.

According to the organization, the teen was selling fruit with his mother and sister on Saturday when he asked to go to the restroom. His mom was reportedly busy tending to a customer at the time, and when she turned back around, he was gone.

After trying to find her son, his mom called Houston police and filed a missing person report.

Hours after the press conference on Friday, Houston Police confirmed with FOX 26 that the teen had been found safe and his family had been contacted.

FOX 26 later learned from FIEL that a law enforcement agency found the teen, and he had been in ICE custody at a Houston-area detention center since Monday. He is reportedly OK.

The family is undocumented. They are working to get him out of custody.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program.
There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.

The federal government is sending mixed signals about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a popular program devised under Barack Obama that had until recently allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children to live and work legally without serious risk of deportation.

On one hand, in a new court filing, the federal government suggested it may eventually resume official consideration of initial Daca applications for the first time in years, which could let tens of thousands of people finally have their petitions processed.

On the other, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that immigrants who say they are under the Daca umbrella “are not automatically protected from deportations”, as the program “does not confer any form of legal status in this country”.

Such an approach has been used by Trump officials to justify detaining about 20 known Daca recipients during the new administration so far – despite no White House or DHS memo, regulation or executive order revealing a policy change.

“We started hearing from those detained that when they tell Ice [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents that they have Daca, the Ice agents say: ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter any more’,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant youth organization United We Dream.

Here’s what to know about Daca, the “Dreamers” it protects, and how Donald Trump’s hardline immigrant agenda is upending that protection.

Who are dreamers?

“Dreamers” is a nickname for immigrants brought stateside as children, who do not have legal status. One estimate counts almost 2.5 million Dreamers in the US.

The moniker refers to the Dream Act, proposed legislation that has been deliberated for decades in an attempt to offer Dreamers a pathway to legal immigration status. Lawmakers have introduced at least 20 iterations of the bill, but despite bipartisan support, no version has cleared both chambers of Congress.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program. There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.

Daca recipients’ average age is 31 years old. California and Texas host the largest Daca populations by far, with 147,440 and 87,890 respectively.

In 2023, more than nine out of 10 Daca recipients who were surveyed by national immigrant-focused organizations were either employed or in school. They reported that having Daca protections had made it possible for them to find jobs that paid better, work in fields that reflected their education and long-term career goals, get professional licenses and reach economic independence. The program had also opened the door for some beneficiaries to buy homes and cars.

What is Daca?

The Daca policy debuted on 15 June 2012 to address Dreamers’ need to work legally and be “lawfully present” in the US rather than hide from immigration enforcement and work under the table. To qualify, an applicant must have come to the country before they were 15 years old, have been aged 30 or younger on the date the Obama administration announced the program and have resided in the US since June 2007, among other requirements.

Daca access is barred for anyone convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors.

Although the program has been a lifeline for many undocumented youth, it’s not a legal status or pathway to citizenship, and the antiquated cutoff dates for eligibility have made it so that Dreamers in high school now are less likely to qualify. At the same time, protracted litigation has long paused the processing of initial Daca applications.

“I think it’s really important to understand how tragic it is that young people who are Americans in every sense but lack one piece of paper here not only aren’t getting a pathway to citizenship, but aren’t even getting these very basic and temporary deportation protections and work authorizations,” said Todd Schulte, president of the advocacy group FWD.us.

Why Congress hasn’t done anything to provide more stability for Dreamers is the “billion-dollar question”, said Diana Pliego, senior strategist for campaigns at the National Immigration Law Center – especially, she added, when more than 80% of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for them, and when it’s estimated that providing that would add about $800bn in US gross domestic product growth over a 10-year period.

Where does the program stand now?

Earlier this year, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in practice that Daca and work permit adjudications should restart as normal everywhere except Texas, where officials successfully argued the state was negatively affected by Daca recipients because of education and healthcare costs.

The window has closed for appeals to the US supreme court, at least for the time being. Now, a district court will eventually decide how to implement the fifth circuit’s ruling, and in a recent court filing, the Trump administration outlined its vision for complying, in part through restarting initial adjudications of Daca petitions.

Yet, simultaneously, the Trump administration said those proposals would “not limit DHS from undertaking any future lawful changes to Daca”, and for now, the status quo prevails.

“This administration can do many things. So we’re just worried about creating an expectation or false hope for people with initial applications,” said Macedo do Nascimento.

Trump tried to phase out Daca during his first administration but was ultimately stopped by the supreme court.

What about Dreamers in Texas?

Though they are likely to still receive deportation protections, there’s a risk that Texas Dreamers may lose both their work permits and their “lawful presence” designation, which would affect their economic prospects and could have larger immigration consequences.

Who is being detained?

Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its mass deportation campaign.

Evenezer Cortez Martínez – who came to the US when he was four years old and had a valid Daca permit through October 2026 – was deported to Mexico in March. He was eventually allowed to return to his wife and children in Kansas City, though he said: “I still have that doubt about whether it’s really true that I’m [back] here.”

Similarly, in August, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira was targeted in El Paso, Texas, in front of his children, his arm being dislocated during the chaos, before he was detained in New Mexico. DHS called him a “criminal illegal alien” because of a decade-old charge for marijuana possession as a teenager that was later reduced to disorderly conduct, and that had never stopped the agency from renewing his Daca protections.

Cortez Martínez and Gamez Lira are two of 20 or so known Daca recipients who have been arrested, detained or deported this year.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, has encouraged Daca recipients to consider voluntary deportation.

To Pliego, that would be a loss for the US.

“These are people who have built their lives here, who, you know, have been here since they were young kids,” she said. “This is their home. And so we’re losing longstanding community members who are contributing to the country, who are giving back in a lot of ways.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fbac16aee1df1683a89d7b938ea41016bd34ce/539_0_3708_2967/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dbf1abcf46db58aa4a63e88fa1f5ba4",N,,2025-10-11 12:57:56.023080

The Fourteenth Amendment does not confer citizenship on the children of illegal aliens, and Congress has never granted it by statute.
AFL, representing allies in the House Judiciary Committee, is urging the Supreme Court to restore the true meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.
U.S. citizenship is a privilege, not a right, and the touchstone is total allegiance to the United States, not mere location or subjection to its laws.","America First Legal (AFL), in partnership with Boyden Gray LLC, has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of eighteen members of the House Judiciary Committee—led by Chairman Jim Jordan—urging the Court to defend the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and the limits it places on U.S. citizenship.

AFL’s brief argues that allegiance is a reciprocal bond requiring loyalty from the individual and consent from the sovereign. When that consent is broken, citizenship cannot be claimed. The Fourteenth Amendment enshrines this principle, granting citizenship only to those born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction—meaning total, exclusive allegiance and lawful presence, not mere location.

The Framers said it plainly: the Citizenship Clause does not include “aliens or anyone owing allegiance to a foreign sovereignty.” Courts and scholars ever since have agreed. Citizenship is not automatic, nor is it a right: it is earned through allegiance, consent, and law.

AFL’s brief emphasizes that there is also widespread agreement that children born in the United States to foreign ambassadors or invading soldiers are not U.S. citizens—not because those parents have immunity, but because they owe allegiance elsewhere. The same principle applies to children of aliens unlawfully present in the country: their parents owe allegiance to another nation and are here without the consent of the United States. This is not a question of compassion, but of constitutional order. Citizenship cannot be born of defiance, and allegiance cannot exist without consent.

AFL’s brief further makes clear that only Congress may confer citizenship. As the Supreme Court has long held, no court or executive agency can invent citizenship outside those bounds. The Fourteenth Amendment does not confer citizenship on the children of illegal aliens, and Congress has never granted it by statute. Thus, it may not be conferred upon the children of aliens, regardless of birthplace.

“Our history and tradition stand for the proposition that citizenship depends upon a public determination of allegiance. Being subject to the country’s jurisdiction is not a default presumption. Instead, citizenship is a duty, a bond, and a privilege reserved for those who are subject to our laws and our sovereignty into an entitlement,” said Dan Epstein, Vice President of America First Legal.

AFL, representing allies in the House Judiciary Committee, is urging the Supreme Court to restore the true meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.

She said she was a WGN employee,” said Josh Thomas, a witness who lives in a condo above the scene in the city’s Lincoln Square neighborhood.
According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the WGN employee, who is also a U.S. citizen, allegedly threw objects at a Border Patrol car.
You’ll see in the video, the WGN [employee] wasn’t Black or brown … they are terrorizing anyone.","An employee of WGN-TV was detained by two Border Patrol officers and later released after federal agents swarmed a busy intersection in Chicago Friday morning.

WGN is not naming the employee, who works in the station’s creative services department, as station policy requires blurring faces and not identifying those who have not been charged with a crime.

Witnesses on site who captured the incident on video spoke to WGN, a local news station owned by Nexstar Media, about the moments leading up to the staffer’s detainment.

“I heard yelling and screaming and honking. I ran downstairs to see what was going on. It looked like Border Patrol agents in a minivan had slammed some lady to the ground. And so, I ran up to her and asked her for her name. She said she was a WGN employee,” said Josh Thomas, a witness who lives in a condo above the scene in the city’s Lincoln Square neighborhood.

Thomas added that when he made his way down to the scene, around 8:30 a.m., he realized there was another person already detained inside the minivan being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

“I didn’t get his name, although I asked for his name,” Thomas said. “He didn’t speak very good English. They claimed that the WGN employee was obstructing justice, even though she was, like all of us, just standing there, taking video.”

Giordana Mahn told WGN-TV that she was in a cab on her way to the airport when she, too, captured the scene.

“She was walking east. We were driving west, and that’s when I took out my phone. They had just, like, tackled her and brought her into the street. That’s when I asked her, ‘What’s your name?'” Mahn said.

According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the WGN employee, who is also a U.S. citizen, allegedly threw objects at a Border Patrol car. She was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer, but was later released without charges, according to WGN-TV.

In an area with condos, apartments, and concerned neighbors, Thomas called Friday’s scene heartbreaking.

“It’s terrifying for the community. When I came back upstairs to my condo, my son was crying and asked me what was happening and if people were going to come take him,” Thomas said.

Mahn shared his sentiments, lamenting her fear for the community.

“I’m scared for my community. I’m scared for anyone who is Black or brown. You’ll see in the video, the WGN [employee] wasn’t Black or brown … they are terrorizing anyone. Everyone in Chicago.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25262760764151-e1758390436498.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-11 16:58:02.809333

We run five of the seven city-contracted day labor centers in Los Angeles, including the Van Nuys Community Job Center.
Our day labor centers are overseen and paid for by the city, and several of our sites are on city-owned or state-owned property.
Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.
Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.","In September, the United States Supreme Court paused a temporary restraining order intended to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from terrorizing Los Angeles with roving patrols, giving ICE the green light to target people because of the color of their skin or the language they speak.

But even while the restraining order was in effect starting in July, ICE never stopped targeting day labor centers in Los Angeles. On August 8, masked men in tactical gear surrounded the Van Nuys Community Job Center, and pointed weapons at my coworkers and me. When I asked to see a warrant, I was met with cold stares and a Border Patrol agent wielding a teargas canister.

I am the executive director of the Instituto de Educación Popular del Sur de California (the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California or IDEPSCA), the largest operator of day labor (jornalero) centers in California. We run five of the seven city-contracted day labor centers in Los Angeles, including the Van Nuys Community Job Center. The City of Los Angeles funds these official day labor centers to provide direct services to day laborers, including know-your-rights trainings, health and immunization clinics, housing support, and language classes, and contracts with nonprofit organizations like IDEPSCA to operate the centers. Our day labor centers are overseen and paid for by the city, and several of our sites are on city-owned or state-owned property.

ICE has raided our day labor sites at least 14 times since June.

Just days before the raid, Mayor Karen Bass hailed a 9th circuit ruling upholding the temporary restraining order against ICE as “a great day for Los Angeles” and said that she hoped fear among immigrant communities in our city would subside.

It didn’t feel like a great day for Los Angeles when we looked down the barrels of guns pointed at us by federal agents in our workplace.

While my coworkers and I were held at gunpoint, I felt fear and rage, but not surprise. This was the 6th time ICE raided the Van Nuys Community Job Center in under three months. Just three hours earlier, my staff witnessed the same Border Patrol agents kidnap seven day laborers from the parking lot in front of the center. Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.

Without the restraining order, things will only get worse. Our entire city is on edge now that ICE is receiving billions more in funding to kidnap and disappear our immigrant neighbors, thanks to congress. ICE’s budget for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1st, is a whopping $18.7 billion.

ICE’s campaign of terror in Los Angeles escalated in June when federal agents in unmarked vehicles stormed the parking lot of the Hollywood Home Depot and surrounding sidewalks, and violently kidnapped 30 day laborers. When people rose up in response to demand ICE vacate the city, they were met with National Guard deployments, ordered by President Donald Trump.

That morning, I started receiving frantic calls from families on the ground, and later, others looking for their loved ones. Many of the people disappeared by ICE were our members. We were able to track down nearly all of those kidnapped — now being held in San Diego detention centers. ICE’s operation was indiscriminate in regard to immigration status: among those kidnapped was a U.S. citizen, later released, and a person with an active asylum case.

These kidnappings were not a one-off horror, but a terrifying new normal driven by the federal government’s white supremacist strategy to erase communities of color. ICE is racially profiling and hunting down people in our streets, making immigrants across our city afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or take their kids to school.

We need political leaders across the nation to act boldly and use the full power of their offices to throw sand in ICE’s gears — introduce legislation, continue to file lawsuits, and call these actions what they are: kidnappings driven by racial profiling. Our city and state leadership must put state resources behind protecting immigrant communities.

Mayor Bass has not been a model of solidarity. In January, she proposed cutting day labor centers completely out of the city’s budget, despite knowing that President Trump specifically named jornaleros as targets and that day laborers were doing dangerous cleanup work during the widely reported on fires that devastated our city. Our funding was only restored because we mobilized and fought back.

The city still isn’t doing enough to protect day labor centers. We call on Mayor Bass and LA elected officials to speak out against ICE’s targeting of day laborers and the worker centers that serve them, and to stand by their promise to protect all Angelenos. It’s time for city and state officials to get creative and use every legal avenue at their disposal.

In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed laws banning ICE from entering schools or hospitals without a warrant.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order banning ICE from operating on any property owned or controlled by the city.

Mayor Bass should follow Governor Newsom and Mayor Johnson’s lead and ban ICE from all city-contracted facilities like our day labor centers.

While we hold our elected leaders to account, we’re not waiting on them to protect and defend our communities. For over 30 years, we’ve built a network of worker and community centers across Los Angeles that builds power and functions as a safety net for our people. Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.

Over the decades, the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California has fought for the dignity and rights of day laborers and domestic workers by providing direct services and mobilizing for campaigns, such as improved minimum wage standards and enforcement, worker safety, and immigrant rights. We’ve raised awareness about the health hazards that day laborers and domestic workers face from wildfires and the frontline role they’ve played in wildfire recovery, and we provide wildfire safety resources as we fight for better protections.

The Institute of Popular Education of Southern California continues to track down workers detained by ICE, bring people their medications, reconnect families, and deliver groceries and other essential aid to impacted communities.

Across Los Angeles, many community members are responding in creative ways — building community defense centers, protesting outside hotels where ICE agents are staying so they can’t sleep, and growing mutual aid networks. But we need more people to be involved.

These raids are not just a threat to undocumented people. Everyone is at risk as this racist and fascist regime uses its power to sow chaos and terrorize our families, friends, and neighbors.

The way we stop them is by growing our community power. If you see unmarked vans or suspect ICE presence, report it to a trusted immigrant rights group. Join or support a local rapid response network. Donate to mutual aid efforts and funds for those in detention. Check in and share resources with your neighbors. Refuse to let kidnapping become normal.

From what we see unfolding in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, it’s clear that Los Angeles was a test site for a larger project of racial terror and ultimately ethnic cleansing. This will continue until we all rise, in all the ways we can, to stop it.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2232619972-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:30.042028

One day following the ruling, protests continued outside the facility as state police kept watch outside the gates. Notably absent was the National Guard, which had been patrolling just 24 hours earlier.

“We will protect the safety of all of our communities and the safety of all of our community members, and they do not feel safe right now,"" said protester Casey Caballero.

Photos and video showed at least four people being roughly dragged from the crowd by their clothes and bags and later handcuffed and led away by Illinois State Police officers.

Those who were arrested have been charged with resisting and obstruction, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said, according to WLS.

Demonstrations have raged across the Second City since Trump initiated “Operation Midway Blitz” — a push to crackdown on illegal immigration across the city which has been resisted by local leaders and protesters.

Trump sent several hundred National Guard soldiers to protect DHS agents as they carry out deportations in Chicago — but on Thursday, Biden-appointed District Judge April Perry granted Illinois’ request for a temporary restraining order to block the National Guard deployment.

Friday’s demonstration came a day after protesters Ray Collins and Jocelyn Robledo — who were carrying loaded weapons when they clashed with ICE officers outside the same Broadview ICE facility on Sept. 27 — had their felony charges dropped after a local grand jury refused to indict them.

At another scene in Lincoln Square on Friday, a video editor for local WGN-TV, Debbie Brockman, was detained by ICE officers, the Chicago Tribune reported.

When they checked in a few days later, ICE detained them again, and on Friday, his father was deported, the Marine told NBC 7.

Steve Rios of Oceanside said he enlisted because of his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez. He said they came to the U.S. from Mexico more than 30 years ago and have washed cars and cleaned houses from sun-up to sundown for his whole life.

“It was just making them proud, right? I’ve seen all the struggles they’ve gone through,” Steve said. “The least I could do, right, and serve this country and try to, you know, put some time in. I don't think amounts to what they've done.”

Steve and his parents were headed to pick up his younger sister Ashley Rios and her husband, who’s also a Marine, at Camp Pendleton on Sept. 28. They’ve done that every weekend for the past few months because she’s expecting her first child.

But Steve said this last time, they were stopped at the gate, and ICE agents arrived, detaining both his parents. Their family says they have no criminal history, as well as pending green card applications – sponsored by Steve – and work visas as they wait for approval.

“It was scary,” Steve said. “It was scary because my whole life, I've kind of just, it's been in the back of my head.”

“My brother texted me that they got stopped. And as soon as I heard that, I just started, like, bawling,” said Ashley, who was waiting for them with her husband, looking forward to eating French toast together. “He asked what was wrong, and I said that my parents were getting taken.”

Their parents were taken downtown and Steve said he was able to pick them up a few hours later, with ankle monitors, and bring them home. They were told to check in with ICE downtown on Thursday, Steve said, so he went with them, and they waited for several hours before learning they would be detained again.

“I just kept on looking at my parents. I didn't know if it would be the last time I'd see them,” Steve said.

ICE agents led his parents away as his father wore a red shirt and white hat that both said “Proud dad of a U.S. Marine,"" an outfit he picked out with intention for the check-in.

“He said, 'Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we'll be fine,'"" Steve said.

Steve said Friday morning, he talked briefly by phone with his dad, who told him they were being held in the basement of the federal building that houses ICE and immigration court, but they were told they will be moved to the Otay Mesa Detention Center.

When asked why the couple was detained, a spokesperson for ICE said in a statement, “As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

“All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,” the statement continued.

“It's just hard because you just want to hear, like, your parents voice, that everything will be OK,” Ashley said, adding that she was nervous, especially thinking about her pregnancy. “I'd always want, like, my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it's just hard to not think about your parents there.”

Steve and Ashley said they weren’t told why their parents were detained and aren’t sure what will happen next, but they both have faith.

“They might get sent back. They might not,” Steve said. “The only person that knows is up there.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/10/marine-parents-detained.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:57.891042

On June 14 Guevara — wearing a bright red T-shirt and his big black vest with PRESS emblazoned on it — went to a “No Kings” protest in Dekalb County, just north of the Atlanta city limits. The crowd was amassed on the sidewalk, so Mario with his video camera walked along the edge of the street to film the signs.

He was jumped by police who ignored his statement that he was with the press and charged him with three misdemeanors, including obstruction and unlawful assembly. Although those charges were dropped, ICE agents showed up at the jail and placed him in removal proceedings.

ICE fought every legal effort by Guevara’s lawyers to release him from the Folkston ICE Processing Center, a GEO Group facility located 247 miles from Atlanta near the Florida border. He was held there for over 100 days until he was transported to Louisiana and then put on a plane to El Salvador.

Tchelly Moise:I was thinking, “Maybe because they know what is going on in Haiti, it’s logically possible to just cancel TPS for the Haitians.” Al Letson:Tchelly says he doesn’t know anyone who is planning to leave the country, at least not willingly. Tchelly Moise:I don’t think no one is going to get on a plane and say, “Hey, I’m going back home.” I don’t think this is going to happen. I think people are going to try everything but leaving this country unless they get arrested by ICE. Al Letson:Tchelly knows a lot of Haitians. That’s because he’s a union representative for workers at one of the largest meat packing plants in the country. It’s owned by JBS, the largest meat producer in the world. At one point not so long ago, the union says the plant in Greeley employed more than 1200 Haitian migrants, just over a third of the workforce. The company has been accused of trafficking these workers, luring them in with the promise of good jobs and a place to live. Instead, the work was dangerous and the living conditions harsh. Speaker 4:Immigrants at a meat packing plant in Greeley say they were victims of a bait-and-switch scheme. Al Letson:Tchelly says he saw firsthand how people were being treated. It’s why he left JBS and started working at the union that represents the workers, to try and fight back and improve conditions. And they had made some gains, bringing national attention to the situation and forcing the company to respond. But now, after going through all of that, the workers are among the more than 300,000 Haitians who could be forced out of the US. Tchelly Moise:We’re talking about Haitians that have had TPS since 2010. Al Letson:We first told you about these Haitian workers back in February when President Trump had just taken office for his second term. And so much has changed since then that we decided to revisit that episode and update you about what’s happened since. To start, Ted Genoways of the Food and Environment Reporting Network reminds us how these people ended up working at a meat packing plant in the first place. Ted Genoways:It all started with a TikTok video. Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:03:32]. I said good news for good news because I had assurance when you’re coming, you’re going to have a job. Ted Genoways:The man in the video is Mackenson Remy. Mackenson is originally from Haiti. He’s in his 30s with braided hair and a thin beard. He’s been living in the US for almost a decade now and moved to Colorado in 2023. At that time, he began making TikTok videos about job openings in the area for his few followers, mostly other Haitians. None of them got that much attention until this one. The video opens with Mackenson driving through the parking lot of a huge meat packing plant, speaking in his native Creole. There are industrial truck beds, people wearing hard hats and reflective vests, and a giant red and white logo on the side of the building reads “JBS.” Mackenson Remy:That job, they pay good. [foreign language 00:04:28]. They pay like $22 and $23 an hour. Ted Genoways:Meat packing work is hard and Mackenson makes it clear in the video. He tells his followers, “This isn’t a job for lazy people or people who don’t like the cold.” Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:04:50]. Ted Genoways:He adds, “Speaking English is not a job requirement.” If his followers come, Mackenson says he even knows a place for them to stay. So if you’re interested. Mackenson Remy:I say, you can text me, tell me when you want to come because I already know if you came, you can have a job. Ted Genoways:Mackenson posted the video that night and when he woke up the next morning … Mackenson Remy:The video has been viral. Ted Genoways:It had gone viral. Less than a year after posting that video, Tchelly’s union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7, would issue a formal complaint to the government, accusing Mackenson and JBS of human trafficking. I’ve found that to keep its profits high, JBS has a track record of recruiting new immigrants who are desperate for work in the United States. And over the last 20 years, the company has been the subject of more than 100 lawsuits, EEOC complaints, and government investigations over its working conditions. Mackenson says he didn’t know very much about JBS when he made the TikTok video. Everything he shared with his followers, he says he learned from Edmond Ebah. Edmond Ebah:My name is Edmond Ebah. I’m from Benin, West Africa. I work at JBS Plant in Greeley in Colorado. Ted Genoways:This is a promo video of Edmond posted to the JBS Facebook page. Edmond Ebah:There is nothing I can say make my world hard because I’m happy to do what I’m doing. Ted Genoways:Lots of soft focus and slow motion, it cuts from scene to scene. Edmond driving a van, Edmond walking through the plant, Edmond making coffee. Then it ends with Edmond sitting in an office. Edmond Ebah:I applied to HR because I speak seven language and I can help people come to work for JBS. Ted Genoways:The video fades to white, text appears saying, quote, “Edmond has helped more than 30 people find a new life path with JBS USA.” Now, speaking seven languages is never not an asset for any job, but it’s especially useful at JBS because nearly all the people Edmond has hired are immigrants. There are over 3000 employees working at the plant in Greeley and the union representing those employees says between 80 and 90 percent are immigrants. JBS is hardly unique. Nationally, the meat packing industry is overwhelmingly dependent on immigrant labor. But Mackenson didn’t know this. He says he was even a little surprised when he first met Edmond. Mackenson Remy:When I meet him, it’s like I think he’s a white guy. He’s like, “Oh, you look like my people.” He say, “Yeah, I’m from Benin.” I say, “Oh, nice, I’m from Haiti.” Ted Genoways:Mackenson met Edmond the same day he made the video, and Edmond told him they had 60 jobs on the line available. Jobs slaughtering, butchering, and packaging the meat. He’s also the one who told Mackenson about the pay, the benefits, and the fact that workers didn’t need to speak English. Mackenson’s other videos on TikTok got maybe a few dozen views at most. The one he posted about the JBS job had 35,000 views the next day. And the messages started pouring in. This was way more people than expected and there are only 60 positions available. So he texts Edmond. Mackenson Remy:I sent the screenshot for him to show him how many people watched the video. Ted Genoways:But he says Edmond didn’t seem at all phased. He just gave Mackenson a new number of available positions. Mackenson Remy:He said even 100 or 200 people, he can help them out. Ted Genoways:This surprised Mackenson, but it doesn’t surprise me. Turnover in the meat packing industry is incredibly high, an estimated 40% each year. That’s because the work is grueling and extremely dangerous. That’s been the case since the earliest days of industrial meat packing at the turn of the 20th Century. People burn out and are injured all the time. But the Haitians who responded to Mackenson needed work and were enticed by the high pay. Plus, Mackenson had said he could help them find a place to stay, but he’d never expected this kind of response. Mackenson Remy:I just scared because when I see a lot of people text me and I didn’t know where they going to live. Ted Genoways:Soon, he gets a text from Edmond, promising that the new hires will be staying at a motel near the plant for two weeks free of charge. Mackenson Remy:So then after I remember, he called me. He say, “Hey, listen, we got a place for them. Don’t worry, let them come. Let them come.” Ted Genoways:And so they came. Mackenson Remy:Hey, my boss, I’m with the guy. I’m waiting for the other one, I’m at the airport right now. Ted Genoways:This is a voice memo Mackenson sent to Edmond from the Denver airport. It was December 2023, and he was picking up some of the first Haitians to arrive. Mackenson Remy:Boss, you see the last guy I sent it to, this is him ticket, he’s already booked the ticket. Ted Genoways:Edmond directed him to bring everyone to a place called the Rainbow Motel. It sits right off a highway about a mile from the JBS plant. Much like other budget motels, there’s not much to it. Tiny rooms, mismatched furniture, some plastic chairs out front. No pool, but there is a fenced-off square of AstroTurf. And yes, there is a neon rainbow on the roof. There were dozens of Haitians who came to Greeley that first month and Mackenson quickly became their point person for almost everything. Mackenson says he would sometimes stick around Greeley for a few days to drive people, to get anything they needed. Food from Walmart, coats from Goodwill. It was becoming a lot. Mackenson Remy:Boss, this work is hard for me, boss, it’s hard. I have to explain everything with them. Ted Genoways:Here’s another one of those voice memos to Edmond. Mackenson Remy:A lot of people want to come on this job, man. I got people, boy. I told you, I’m an influencer, bro. That’s why they trust me, bro. They really trust me, bro. Ted Genoways:Mackenson says he would charge each person he picked up at the Denver airport $120 to make the two-and-a-half hour trip from Greeley and back. He also charged for the rides to Walmart and Goodwill. But Mackenson said what he really wanted was to be hired by JBS and he asked Edmond to connect him with his boss. Mackenson Remy:He said, “Okay, no problem. Be patient.” When the second group came, I talked to him about the same thing. He told me the same thing, “You have to be patient.” Ted Genoways:Were you being paid by JBS? Mackenson Remy:Nothing. JBS never paid me for anything. Ted Genoways:And still, people kept coming. 100, 200, more. Even though Mackenson was frustrated with Edmond and JBS, he kept telling himself that, at the end of the day, he was doing something good, helping his fellow Haitians find a better life. People like Auguste. That’s not his real name. We’ve given him an alias because he’s worried about retaliation from JBS. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:25] Ted Genoways:Auguste came to the US from Haiti in 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:34]. Ted Genoways:He calls it an epic experience. And by all accounts, it was. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:40]. Ted Genoways:He first flew to Brazil in March 2023 and set off north, traveling across 10 different countries. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:50]. Ted Genoways:The journey included crossing the Darien Gap, a 60-mile expanse of thick rainforest at the Columbia-Panama border. Auguste walked thousands of miles. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:02]. Ted Genoways:He says he slept on the jungle floor, woken up by the sounds of wild animals in the night. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:13]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me he was always on guard because people warned him of armed thieves along the way, who would rob people or worse. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:25]. Ted Genoways:And then of course, there were the dead. Auguste says he saw bodies along the way, of people who would never finish the journey. It took a month, but he finally made it to Mexico, where Auguste immediately applied to enter the US legally via temporary protected status, TPS for short. It’s a rigorous process. He was fingerprinted as part of a background check, his cheek was swabbed for medical screening. Finally, his application was approved. Auguste entered the US in the spring of 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:10]. Ted Genoways:Today, there are more than 200,000 Haitians in the US under TPS, making them one of the largest groups with that status. Auguste spent six months waiting for work authorization, often going hungry. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:28]. Ted Genoways:But Auguste tells me it’s easier to live without food than it is without hope. Then he heard about Mackenson’s video. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:41]. Ted Genoways:He was living in Baltimore and struggling to find work. A friend of his already moved to Greeley and got hired by JBS. He told Auguste the job was legit, so Auguste decided to go, too. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:55]. Ted Genoways:When he arrived in Colorado, he was taken straight to the Rainbow Motel. The room was pretty small, just big enough to walk around a full sized bed, one bathroom, no closet, a mini fridge. And to his surprise, Auguste learned he would be sharing this room. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:17]. Ted Genoways:He tells me there were five, six, seven, sometimes eight people in one room. Auguste was sleeping on the floor. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:29]. Ted Genoways:He tells me it was hard to live this way. When was that? Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:39]. Tchelly Moise:December 2023. Ted Genoways:That’s Tchelly, translating for Auguste. We’re sitting together in an office at the union. Tchelly never lived at the Rainbow Motel, but he saw what was happening there. Tchelly Moise:Well, me, I was I would say not a victim of the process, but I was a direct witness to the process. Ted Genoways:It’s part of the reason he left his job at JBS and went to work for the union instead. Tchelly Moise:This is extremely bad. When you go to the Rainbow Motel and you have eight people inside of one little motel room with one bed, one bathroom, women and men at the same time, so no privacy. When people have to use the bathroom, it was a very bad situation. Ted Genoways:There was also nowhere to make food. The motel was off a busy highway with no grocery stores, no restaurants, nothing around for miles. Tchelly Moise:We’ve had people saying, “I was starving for two to three days because I don’t know where to go get food.” Ted Genoways:The people brought to live in the Rainbow Motel were in a strange place with little to no money, many didn’t speak English. Plus, it was December and freezing outside. Tchelly says people felt stranded. The motel has 17 rooms, and at the peak Mackenson counted over 100 Haitians staying there at once. It got so packed at one point, that Tchelly says Edmond was forced to rent a house nearby. The conditions there weren’t any better. Tchelly Moise:There were around 40 people living inside of the house. I’m saying people sleeping on the floor, on the blankets, people everywhere. And at some point, they didn’t have electricity in the house and it was winter. Ted Genoways:Auguste was one of the people living there. After a week-and-a-half in the motel, he spent five months in this unfurnished house. The people living there were charged $60 to $70 a week. Auguste:[foreign language 00:17:42]. Ted Genoways:But he says at least in the house, they had a kitchen. There may be a line of people waiting to use it, but at least it was there. Meanwhile, Auguste and his housemates were still expected to go to work. These jobs are essentially like working on a disassembly line, like a standard factory run in reverse. The whole cow walks off the back of a cattle trailer and is slaughtered, then broken down into steaks, and roasts, and ribs, and hamburger meat. This work is done with things like power knives and bone saws, tools meant to cut flesh and bone. It’s no surprise that this can lead to injuries. I’ve talked to dozens of people over my career who have lost fingers or had hands crushed by grinders. I remember one man who was a gut snatcher, which is exactly what it sounds like. The gut snatcher pulls all the guts out of the animal, while the spine splitter cuts through the vertebrae with a bone saw. But this time, they got out of sync. The spine splitter went too soon and the gut snatcher lost four of his fingers. Stories like these are common across the industry. According to data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, jobs at meat packing and poultry companies are consistently among the most dangerous. Workers at JBS and their union say the speed of the line makes serious injuries like amputation more commonplace. But the profits that companies like JBS make depend on how much meat they remove and how fast. Around the same time this new crop of Haitian workers was hired, JBS had introduced its aptly named White Bone Program. Kim Cordova:This is a program where what the company is trying to do is get as much of the meat and product off of a bone it’s literally like white bone. Ted Genoways:This is Kim Cordova, president of UFCW 7, the Greeley plant union. She says the white bone program meant more cutting, more repetition, more exertion, and all at a dizzying speed. Kim Cordova:The line speeds were really increasing to line speeds we had never seen before. Ted Genoways:Almost all of the Haitian workers were put on the same evening shift from about 2:00 to 11:00 PM, B shift. Tchelly says B shift had faster speeds than the day shift. Tchelly Moise:Way faster. We have people that have been working at the plant for 10, 15 years and they can tell us they have never seen any chain speed going over 390. Ted Genoways:That’s 390 head of cattle per hour. Typically, workers on the day shift rarely saw speeds above 300 per hour. Tchelly Moise:But right now, you’re having 420. At some point, we had 430. Ted Genoways:That’s roughly 35,000 cows a week. Kim Cordova:Workers are really put at risk for their safety because it is so fast. Ted Genoways:Kim says people were getting injured. Union members were going to JBS management almost every day, telling them to slow things down because this wasn’t safe. Tchelly Moise:Sometimes, we went from 420 to 410, which is still unacceptable. Ted Genoways:And it wasn’t just the chain speed. Kim Cordova:This new group of workers were being forced to sign documents in languages that they don’t speak, in English actually, that waived their rights or abandoned their injury claims. Ted Genoways:Workers’ medical cards were being kept from them. Kim Cordova:Medical bills not being paid. Ted Genoways:Workers’ mail was being withheld. Kim Cordova:The supervisor had total control of their US mail. Ted Genoways:Haitians were being treated differently than other workers. Tchelly Moise:If I asked for a break to go to the bathroom, I would not get it. Ted Genoways:Meanwhile, Auguste and his fellow Haitians would go back to a so-called home with little to no food, a line for the bathroom, and only the floor to sleep on. Auguste:[foreign language 00:21:53]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me every day at work, he couldn’t help but notice … Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:01]. Ted Genoways:… that each cow had its own little cage. Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:08]. Ted Genoways:But he was expected to share a tiny space with five, six, seven, eight of his coworkers. It was darkly ironic, but he found himself thinking the cows had it better. What does that make you think as you see that the cows are treated better than the workers? Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:42]. Tchelly Moise:He say, “It even make think about the past. I feel like I was being treated as a slave.” If we need to take a break, we can. Al Letson:Coming up, JBS is forced to respond. Ted Genoways:They told the union that they had never heard the name Mackenson, that they didn’t believe that there was such a person. Mackenson Remy:They lie. They lie. Al Letson:That’s up next on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. In September 2024, JBS made national news. The Wall Street Journal published a story about a new wave of Haitian workers at JBS and the terrible living conditions they found in Greeley, Colorado. The headline read, “Life for Haitian immigrants, jobs nobody wants and sleeping on the floor.” Mackenson Remy was featured heavily throughout, alongside allegations of exploitation from the very Haitians he thought he was helping. Mackenson Remy:Those Haitian, most of them, they hate me. They think I made money from them. Al Letson:Some workers alleged that Mackenson was working for JBS and getting paid for how many people he brought to Greeley. Mackenson Remy:Some of them, they said JBS give me $3,000 for each of them, each of them. Al Letson:Mackenson denies all of this. Mackenson Remy:I charge people to take them at the airport and I charge people if they need services. I didn’t charge anyone for job. No, I’m not a criminal. Al Letson:Mackenson says he was following directions from Edmond Ebah, the HR supervisor with JBS. Edmond was the one who told him to bring people to the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson doesn’t deny knowing how many people were packed in each room, but he says he never heard anyone complain, at least not to him. But dozens of complaints were made to the UFCW 7, the union representing the JBS plant in Greeley. And now, Mackenson’s name was in the news, alongside all those allegations. Mackenson Remy:I just like doing that for my people. I didn’t get money from anyone. When they see me, they talk very badly about me. It’s very stressful for me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, has been covering the meatpacking industry for over a decade. In that time, he’s watched JBS get sued again and again for allegations of workplace discrimination, wage suppression, and unfair hiring practices. All the while, JBS continues to grow dramatically. The company made $77 billion in 2024. Here’s Ted again. Ted Genoways:The union had raised concerns to JBS about the squalid living conditions long before the Wall Street Journal article came out. JBS had told the UFCW 7 that it was investigating, but the union didn’t hear anything for months. But now, with these allegations made public, JBS was forced to respond. So I’m sure you know, JBS claims that they had no knowledge of this system. TChelly Moise:Well, I’ve seen- Ted Genoways:This is TChelly Moise again, the union rep with UFCW 7. TChelly Moise:… the spokesperson from JBS that said, “Any allegations are completely unacceptable.” This is the exact word that I think I’ve seen online. Ted Genoways:Here are the exact words that a spokeswoman for JBS sent in an email to the Wall Street Journal. She said the company found, “Reports about living conditions, unacceptable and alarming.” TChelly Moise:What exactly is unacceptable? Is it the allegations or the actual situation that was going on? Ted Genoways:In that same email to the Wall Street Journal, JBS says it wants all of its employees to have access to safe housing. The company fired the two HR managers above Edmond. And Edmond was moved to a different facility. The company says it also put in new training programs to teach employees about proper recruitment. JBS maintains that their leadership didn’t know what was happening at the Rainbow Motel, something TChelly finds really hard to believe. TChelly Moise:It is really hard for anyone from JBS to deny what was happening when they had someone from that plant supervising those people every day, assigning them room and filling an application for them. It’s really hard for you to deny when you’re directly involved like that. Ted Genoways:I’ve seen the texts to Mackenson that prove at least Edmond knew. Mackenson Remy:If JBS said they didn’t know anything about the motel, they lie. I got the text message from Edmond. Ted Genoways:Edmond asked Mackenson, who was being checked into the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson replied with five, six names to a room. At one point in January 2024, Mackenson sent a list of nearly 50 people staying in nine rooms. But after the Wall Street Journal article came out, Edmond abruptly cut ties with Mackenson. I tried to reach Edmond many times, even dropping by his house. Marianne:Edmond? Ted Genoways:I’m Ted Genovese. This is my wife, Marianne. We were just hoping to talk to you for a few minutes if you’ve got time. Edmon Ebah:I get your text message. I’m going to respond to you. Trust me, we will have a conversation. Ted Genoways:He never got back to me, and instead, directed me to a company spokesperson. JBS did eventually send me a short email, in response to the many questions I sent them from my reporting. Their statement repeats much of what they sent the journal. They want all employees to have access to safe housing. They’ve hired new HR leaders and put in place new recruitment training programs. The company says they’ve taken the situation very seriously, but ultimately, deny any involvement. JBS says it conducted two separate investigations and, “No substantiated evidence was provided that tied Edmond Ebah or company leadership to the claims outlined by the union.” They did not respond to the fact that I’ve seen the text messages and phone calls between Edmond and Mackenson. JBS just underscored that Mackenson never worked for the company. And after the “alarming allegations came out,” they say they banned him from the plant. In response to the reports of dangerously fast line speeds, JBS simply said it follows the law. The email ends with, “At JBS, we have best in class workforce eligibility, safety and compliance standards.” But the union is still demanding answers. Here’s Kim Cordova again, president of the UFCW 7. Kim Cordova:We have been dealing with what we believe is human trafficking and exploitation of these workers. Ted Genoways:In 2024, the union filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, and the National Labor Relations Board alleging exactly that. Kim says, “These Haitian migrants at JBS were brought here under false pretenses. They were promised a job and a place to stay, but the job wasn’t just hard, it was unsafe. And this wasn’t proper housing. They were sleeping on the floor of a tiny motel room with a bunch of strangers sharing one bathroom and little to no food.” The complaint calls this abuse of workers and it says that JBS’s investigations into this treatment were, “a whitewash.” And Kim believes she knows how we got here. Kim Cordova:I mean, the one thing COVID did was shed the light on what I call the dark secret of the packing industry. It exposed everything. Ted Genoways:Back during the pandemic, US meat workers were considered essential. After meatpacking plants across the country were forced to close, then President Trump, ordered them to reopen. And so even though the JBS plant in Greeley didn’t have COVID safety protocols in place, it brought workers back to the line. OSHA fined JBS for, “Failing to protect employees from exposure to the coronavirus.” If you watched Last Week Tonight, you probably heard John Oliver talk about it back then. John Oliver:After six workers from a JBS plant in Colorado died from COVID, the company’s total fine was just $15,000. Ted Genoways:But $15,000 was just .00003% of the company’s revenue at the time. John Oliver:And if you find a company, a fraction of a percent of their profits, don’t be surprised when they carry on only giving a fraction of a (beep) about the welfare of their workers. Ted Genoways:Kim says this started a huge fight between the company and its workers. Kim Cordova:We started to see workers mobilize, stand up, fight back. There were walk-offs not just here, but around the country. Workers were not going to die for their job. Ted Genoways:This not only led to more personal protective equipment, it also led to a new contract. The union had pressed the CEO for higher wages and better benefits and won. Kim Cordova:And workers got stronger, in my opinion, and I think that that’s what has sparked some of the change. Ted Genoways:Kim says shortly after they renegotiated that contract with the CEO, he retired and was replaced. Then came a wave of firings among union workers. Then came the white bone program and hundreds of brand new Haitian workers. The UFCW 7 complaint to the Department of Labor says, “The plant increased chain speeds to dangerously unsafe levels when these workers occupied the line.” Kim Cordova:In our opinion, they needed a new group of workers to come in, so that they had more control over them, especially to work at this high speed. Ted Genoways:TChelly says, he thinks the company just saw an opportunity and took it. TChelly Moise:Big companies like that, one of the first goal is to make money. And unfortunately, most of the time, it doesn’t matter how this money is made, it doesn’t matter what cost. Ted Genoways:August still works at JBS. After about six months, he was able to save enough money to move into his own place with his own bed and bathroom, but it all comes with a cost. As far as we know, the white bone program is still going on. August:[foreign language 00:10:30] Ted Genoways:And August told me he can no longer fully close his left hand, an injury he believes as a result of his work being too fast and too repetitive. Despite everything though, August says he is still glad to be here. August:Yeah. [foreign language 00:10:51] Ted Genoways:Because his life is stable now and he just hopes things continue to get better. Then came the second Trump administration. Donald Trump:We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger than- Ted Genoways:On the campaign trail, Trump promised to deport an unprecedented 15 to 20 million people and said, he would direct federal agencies to go after undocumented immigrants. But he also promised to go after immigrants here legally by ending programs like temporary protected status. Reporter:So you would revoke the temporary protected status? Donald Trump:Absolutely, I’d revoke it, and I’d bring them back to their country. TChelly Moise:Going back to Haiti is a death sentence really. Ted Genoways:TChelly Moise again. TChelly Moise:The biggest issue is not the deportation itself. The biggest issue is what is going to happen after the deportation. Because most of us, not to say all of us, we left the country obviously, because it was very bad in… You’re talking to some members at the plant, and they’re telling you, “Man, my cousin just got killed today and my family members, they just burned some house.” So it’s getting worse every day. You really don’t know where it’s going to get. It’s really bad. Ted Genoways:The New York Times has been tracking deportations and it’s found that the Trump administration is on pace to deport more than 400,000 people this year. While that’s far less than Trump’s campaign trail promise, the government’s tactics are disrupting communities across the country and a lot of what’s happening is unprecedented. There have been aggressive immigration raids in the recent past, but they usually focused on workplaces like meatpacking plants. Newscaster:Federal officials said today, that yesterday’s immigration raids at six meatpacking plants were the largest workplace crackdown ever. Ted Genoways:In May of 2006, then President George W. Bush, addressed the nation with promises of a new immigration policy. Part of that policy was to find and deport undocumented workers. And on December 12th of that year, he made good on that promise. Immigration and customs enforcement carried out a coordinated raid of meatpacking plants across the middle of the country. They were all run by Swift & Company, the world’s second largest beef producer at the time. Armed ICE officers arrested and deported nearly 1,300 undocumented workers at these plants. Here’s Mark Lauritsen, then vice president of the UFCW, speaking with PBS at the time. Mark Lauritsen:That one small community, the school district still held 25 children, some as young as six years old, because their parents were not around to pick them up. They were in a bus some place to points unknown. Ted Genoways:The Swift plants were located all across the country, places like Cactus, Texas, Grand Island, Nebraska, Marshalltown, Iowa, and Greeley, Colorado. In the Greeley plant alone, 220 undocumented workers were detained. After the raid, production came to a screeching halt. And though they were able to get things moving again, it was never back at the level it was before the raids. Within a year, Swift was forced to shut down and sell the plant. The buyer, JBS. And now you have to wonder, will JBS and the thousands of immigrants it employs meet a similar fate? Kim Cordova:This workforce is an immigrant workforce. Ted Genoways:Union president, Kim Cordova again. She says at one point, there were 57 languages spoken at the Greeley plant alone. Kim Cordova:JBS is the largest food producer in the world. The industry would collapse without these type of workers. Ted Genoways:The Trump campaign promised it would lower grocery prices, but deporting the workforce that meatpackers depend on would halt processing at every stage of the supply chain, from feed lots, to the packing house floor. This would drive up prices for Big Macs and Outback steaks, but also for chicken breasts and pork chops at grocery stores. TChelly says, “That’s why deporting all these people doesn’t make any sense.” TChelly Moise:I feel like us, the immigrants, we are a good part of the economy. Like I said, most of the jobs that we’re doing, people who are born in this country are not in line to do those jobs. They’re not actively looking to do those jobs. Ted Genoways:This is why TChelly says he’s confused. If mass deportations hurt not only JBS, but the economy as a whole, why do it? He says he’s left with only one answer. TChelly Moise:I think it’s just hatred against people with different skin color, because that’s the only logical thing that I can actually see. Deporting everyone, I don’t see how it can benefits honestly. I don’t see. Al Letson:Up next, we fast-forward to the present day to see how ending TPS is impacting TChelly and the other workers. TChelly Moise:I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:That’s coming up on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today, we’re returning to a story we first brought you in February, back when President Trump was weeks away from fulfilling a promise to not just go after undocumented immigrants, but to also target people living in the country legally. Speaker 2:A really scary time for the Haitian community as the federal government has set a deadline for deportation. The pressure is now on find answers and do them fast. Al Letson:Haitians with temporary protected status were told to leave the U.S. by August 3rd. But a federal judge intervened and extended that deadline to February 2026. This is the second time the Trump administration has attempted to end TPS for Haitians. During Trump’s first term, the White House claimed Haiti was once again safe and people could return. Several groups sued, arguing that Haitians were being racially targeted, and TPS remained in place. This time around, the administration says it’s ending TPS because Haitian gangs could be using the program to enter the US and threaten our national security. Only, the Department of Homeland Security has offered no proof this is happening. And once again, several groups are suing the government to keep TPS in place. Shelly says all of this is frustrating because not only are people like him not in gangs, they came here to get away from the gangs. Shelly:We are not really criminals. I mean, a lot of us in this country, we’ve never really had not even a speeding ticket. I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways of the Food & Environment Reporting Network has been keeping up with the Haitian workers at JBS, and he’s joining me now to update us on where things stand. Welcome back, Ted. Ted Genoways:Thanks, Al. Al Letson:Okay. So, first things first. What’s happening with the workers at the plant in Greeley, Colorado? Do they still have their jobs? Ted Genoways:So, Shelly was telling us that since February JBS has fired somewhere between 300 and 400 workers at the plant in Greeley. The Union says that’s about a third of the Haitians hired in the last year or so. Shelly:The company called them in, and they let them know that unfortunately we have to stop working. Ted Genoways:The Union says the workers were given 30 days to give the company documentation that proves they could continue to legally work in the U.S. Al Letson:But wait. If TPS doesn’t expire until February, how is the company able to fire all these people already? Ted Genoways:Well, when you’re working on TPS or other immigration programs, you’re given the right to apply for a work permit. Then once you get the permit, you have to keep renewing it. And some of these workers had let their permits expire. In the past, the company probably wouldn’t have been as aggressive about enforcing that paperwork, but because the Trump administration has put Haitian workers under scrutiny, companies like JBS are being more vigilant and asking more questions. It usually goes something like this. Bryce Downer:HR reaches out to me to say, “Hey, listen, we’re covering our [inaudible 00:03:32] here.” Ted Genoways:This is Bryce Downer. Bryce Downer:“You’re going to have to provide us with evidence of your authorization to be able to be employed, otherwise, you’ll have to be terminated.” Ted Genoways:Bryce is an immigration lawyer with Novo Legal, and has been working on cases for these workers. In theory, he says, an employer could allow time for these employees to figure out their work status, but the company risks being hit with penalties. And Bryce says companies like JBS simply aren’t willing to do that. Bryce Downer:It is a very difficult time right now for immigration attorneys that are counseling these employers, because generally speaking they’re incredibly conservative. Zero liability, zero risk. Al Letson:But I mean, losing 400 workers in just a few months, still seems like a big problem, right? I mean, isn’t that impacting production? Ted Genoways:Yeah. I actually asked JBS about the number of Haitian workers that were fired. And they said they don’t track workers based on national origin. But in a written statement, a spokesperson said that the company is focused on hiring people legally authorized to work in the United States and would continue to follow the guidance provided by the government. As for the workers that were fired, JBS said that if people can prove their status has changed, they would be eligible to be hired. And the company said, “At this point in time, our facilities are operating normally and our production levels remain unchanged.” When I read that last line to Shelly, he didn’t argue with it. Shelly:I would say that this is exactly right, because before they let someone go, there’s already someone there to replace them. So production is not really affected. Ted Genoways:According to the Union, JBS has mostly been replacing Haitian workers with Somali workers, another immigrant population whose TPS is still active, at least for now. Bryce says The industry has always turned immigrant populations because, for the most part, Americans are just not willing to take these jobs. Bryce Downer:And so who’s the next most vulnerable community in line? Ted Genoways:Basically, JBS has been jumping from one immigrant group to another for years. And as we heard in our original story, the way the company treats these workers has been under a lot of scrutiny and complaints over unsafe working conditions that the plant continue. Al Letson:Well, yeah, let’s talk about that. What happened with the complaint Shelly’s Union filed, the one accusing JBS and McKesson of human trafficking? Ted Genoways:Right. So the National Labor Relations Board is the government body that was supposed to be investigating this complaint. But in January, right after taking office, Trump fired two members of the board, leaving them without a working quorum, effectively killing any investigations. He finally announced new appointees just recently, but they haven’t been confirmed yet. So, even if the nominees are appointed, it’s possible that the Haitians in Greeley could be scheduled for deportation before any investigation can even be completed. For its part, JBS has continued to insist that it thoroughly investigated and found no evidence that showed its employees were involved in trafficking Haitian workers. Al Letson:So Ted, oftentimes these companies justify using immigrant labor like this as a way to keep grocery prices low. It’s something that President Trump even promised to do when he was on the campaign trail. So, I can’t help but to wonder what this all means for the price of meat. Ted Genoways:Right. So, the price of beef has increased 14% since August of last year. It’s such a steep increase the consumers are actually starting to cut back on buying beef, which historically just never happens. At the same time, JBS, along with three other companies, are being sued for allegedly manipulating the market. The claim is that big beef packers like JBS have a monopoly on beef and are artificially inflating prices. I think this underscores just how big and powerful JBS really is. Al Letson:And I guess when you’re this big, it’s pretty easy to fire a few hundred Haitians just like that. Ted Genoways:Yeah, just like that. But Al, that hasn’t been the story for everyone. August and Shelly are both still working in Greeley, and it looks like they will be able to continue for the foreseeable future. Al Letson:How so? Ted Genoways:U.S. immigration law is confusing, always. And it’s especially confusing right now. But when your livelihood depends on it, you get pretty savvy pretty fast. August and Shelly got new work permits, but those will expire in February, when TPS is supposed to end for Haitians. So they also did something else. They applied for asylum, which means that even if TPS gets rescinded, they may still be able to stay in the U.S. as they wait for their asylum cases to be decided. It’s a bit of a gamble, because the Trump administration has been trying to limit the rights of asylum seekers. But in theory, it’s another shot at a green card, and even citizenship. Now, there are so many Haitians who don’t have that kind of second chance. Shelly has spoken to many of them. And he says some tell him they will try to go to Canada, but most of them plan to just lay low and wait for another job, another court ruling, or even another president. Shelly:I can only wait, and I can only hope things get better. We hope something better comes. Al Letson:It’s such a tough situation. Ted, thanks so much for updating us about what’s happened since you first reported that story. Ted Genoways:It’s good to talk to you, Al.

URGE placed a heavy emphasis on knowing one’s rights in case students happen to find themselves in a situation with law enforcement or immigration enforcement; that is, the right to remain silent and speak with a lawyer.","On Oct. 9, the student-led organization URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity) held their weekly meeting to discuss immigration rights and the increase in border patrol and interior immigration enforcement following the passing of bills such as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and the “Keep STEM talent act.” The meeting began at 7:30 p.m. and lasted until 8:30 p.m.

URGE is a national organization with several chapters across American universities, including Washburn. They discuss all matters relating to their acronym, advocating and highlighting different communities to ensure that their voices are heard. They also work to make wellness products free and accessible on campus, such as Plan B, condoms and menstrual products. URGE is partnered with HALO (Hispanic American Leadership Organization), which is an organization that helps promote and support the Hispanic community on campus.

The meeting began with an interactive icebreaker game that many students readily engaged in. It involved throwing a beach ball with questions on it before the meeting was relocated due to technical problems.

Once the meeting was relocated, it began with a presentation from Loud Light, discussing the importance of voting and voting registration, which smoothly segued into the next presentation. The presentation informed students about the history of immigration, along with the current legislation, knowing your rights and how to be an ally.

Covering things such as the timeline and history of immigration, which began in 1776 with the publication of “Common Sense” by Thomas Paine. URGE discussed that the book relates back to current legislation and issues, as ICE continues to operate despite the recent shutdown of the government.

URGE placed a heavy emphasis on knowing one’s rights in case students happen to find themselves in a situation with law enforcement or immigration enforcement; that is, the right to remain silent and speak with a lawyer.

The members spoke about how being an ally can be as simple as asking what one can do to help. Including people and having discussions about current events can help spread awareness on matters and can help students advocate for what they need. URGE also mentioned that students can use their privilege to advocate for those who may not be safe to do so as well. Paloma Martinez, junior anthropology and criminal justice major, spoke on personal motives to advocate for these rights.

“What inspires me the most is my ethnic identity. I am Mexican, so I am trying to help the Hispanic community, because I am privileged enough,” Martinez said. “My mom’s white, my dad’s Hispanic, so I definitely feel like I have the ability if something actually ever happens to me.”

Empowering voices from different communities is vital in creating a healthy and inclusive environment that URGE prioritizes in their mission. Parker Whaley, vice president of URGE, speaks on what inspires them to get involved with these matters.

“[It’s] the safety and advocacy part of it and making people feel like they belong and [the] things that affect them are important,” Whaley said. “It affects a lot of people in a really heavy way and if nobody talks about it, then those communities will feel like it’s not important and what’s happening to them doesn’t matter. And that’s the complete opposite of the truth.”

The event ended by opening up for discussion. Students were welcomed to ask questions or share thoughts and stories of their own. Protests were brought up as a good way to advocate for rights and students brought up the No King’s protest taking place on Oct.18 at the Kansas State Capitol. Students were eager to engage in this discussion to provide information regarding protests and other organizations. Red Black, junior political science major, spoke on why they chose to attend this event.

“This event in particular is a really important one. While we’re closing out Hispanic Heritage Month, we want to keep that on people’s minds,” Black said. “Also, immigration has been a really serious issue with the recent political situations, especially with Customs Enforcement going into cities and impersonating police officers. We want to make sure that people are above and beyond safe.”

URGE holds meetings weekly. Their next meeting will be on Oct. 23 from 7:30-8:30 p.m. in the Blair Room at the Living Learning Center. They will be discussing the history of menstrual products and making medieval hats for their costume contest.

The HALO organization will be holding their next meeting on Oct.16 from 6-7 p.m. in the Blair Room of the LLC, and they will be having a cultural trivia night.

“Right-leaning parties tend to talk tough on immigration so that they keep the nationalist factions within their parties happy, but then quietly they act open towards migration,” Professor Gamlen said.

“They need to keep businesses happy by keeping labour flowing. So that’s kind of the classic right-leaning party’s strategy on migration for the last several decades.

“And then conversely on the left-wing side, we see the opposite kind of doublespeak in many places where left-leaning parties speak very positively about migration-driven diversity, and sort of claim to be the representatives of diversity to satisfy the liberal intelligentsia who favour human rights and migration.“But then at the same time, what left-leaning parties do is keep unions happy with strong labour market regulations which tend to cut migration levels, tend to make it harder to migrate.”

Looking at the figures

ANU has broken down the data finding the Coalition has generally expanded temporary migration.

The Liberal and National Governments tied universities to international student fees, created the 457 visa, expanded post-study work rights, and signed nearly 70 per cent of Australia’s working holiday migration agreements.

Labor has often tightened immigration policy. They raised financial, compliance, and labour standards on students and skilled workers, and introduced stricter integrity measures on colleges, savings, English language tests, and visa hopping.

Pressure to cut immigration rate

Annual net overseas migration peaked at 555,000 when borders reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic under the Albanese Government.

But have since dropped by 40 per cent.

However, there is political and public pressure on Labor to cut further.

Guardian Essential polling shows 53 percent of Australians think the current permanent migration cap for 2025-2026 of 185,000 is too high.

Populist parties are rising around the globe including the Republicans under Donald Trump and Reform UK under Nigel Farage.

The latest Newspoll has Pauline Hanson’s One Nation on an 11 per cent primary vote.

But Gamlen doesn’t believe a populist anti-immigration party will takeover in Australia.

“Although we often compare ourselves with them, the US and the UK are really very different from Australia,” Gamlen said.

“One of the big differences is that they have functionally open borders in a way that Australia does not and never has had.

“It’s partly about being an island nation, but it’s partly just about the fact that we’ve got this actually finely tuned and well-oiled machine in government and across many of our democratic institutions that is geared towards managing immigration because it’s such an important part of Australia’s modern story.”

‘Establish an immigration department’

Gamlen’s key advice to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is to re-establish an independent Immigration Department that handles visa compliance, and an independent research bureau on migration.

“There should be a restoration of the concentrated policy expertise in migration in one part of government in one properly empowered agency,” Gamlen said.

“You know if they do those two things and get the facts, set a basis for you know a common set of facts that we can all discuss a debate, that are reliable that will improve the quality of the debate, then that will lead into a better deliberation in our parliament.”",https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-20315336/33d617b45c8fc6d05b0b67c258a7f354de469b1b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.png?imwidth=1200,N,,2025-10-11 08:56:33.918075

With Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations beginning, some people have been scared to go out and celebrate their culture for fear of ICE.
The presence of ICE goes even further than events like those during Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month.
Despite this, the Latinx/Hispanic community continues to celebrate and take pride in its rich culture.
The Lowrider parade was extremely successful this year, bringing together many people of Latinx/Hispanic heritage.","Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month lasts from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. The celebrations commemorate the rich history and culture of those who identify as Latinx and/or Hispanic. Recently, laws reinforced by the Trump administration have made it challenging for some people to come forward and openly celebrate this month.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was created in 2003. According to its official website, it aims to “protect national security and public safety by enforcing federal laws and prosecuting cross-border crime.” ICE is composed of two main task forces: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which deals with transnational crimes, and Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO), which enforces immigration laws. ICE reports to the president, who appoints the director of the organization.

The current administration has increased funding for the immigration department. In July, 2025, Congress approved legislation that gave $170 billion to immigration and border enforcement. Funding for ICE specifically increased from around eight billion dollars before the current administration to around $28.7 billion now. As a result of the additional funding, there has been an increase in the presence of ICE within cities and towns in recent months. There has been a growing number of reported instances of ICE raiding towns and homes and detaining individuals.

“We’ve seen our family members and friends from Southern California be picked up by ICE on their way to school or work, and so it just puts a lot more pressure on us here in the Bay, because we’re like, what if we’re next?” Itzel Vasquez Calvo, an Ethnic Studies teacher at Berkeley High School, said.

Berkeley is considered a “City of Refuge” and a sanctuary city. A sanctuary city is a city that enacts policies to limit its cooperation between the local and state governments and the federal government regarding immigration measures. In mid-2025, the Department of Justice began filing lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions, laws that limit the policy’s effectiveness. This led some sanctuary cities to revoke all of their jurisdiction over immigration officers. In other cities, it led to the city’s laws officially being in direct conflict with federal laws. Berkeley is one of the many cities that have had lawsuits filed against them, but they remain committed to maintaining their sanctuary status.

With Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations beginning, some people have been scared to go out and celebrate their culture for fear of ICE. Calvo is from Oaxaca, Mexico, and said she has many family members who are scared about what might happen if they attend celebrations. “(My family is) only willing to put themselves at risk for essential things, like getting groceries and going to their jobs and so the other festivals or concerts or parades, is kind of secondary like, ‘Oh, we don’t have to, we don’t want to put ourselves out there for no reason,’” Calvo said.

On Sunday, Sept. 21, 2025, an event called “Comunidad en al Placita” took place, organized by the Latinos Unidos de Berkeley organization. The event was supposed to be held at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, but many vendors moved inside the BHS campus in order to feel safer and protected.

The relocation came at a cost. “It was really poorly attended. Normally, there are a lot of people that come, and there’s a lot of music, and it feels very celebratory, but it was very muted. (...) People are erring on the side of caution and staying home and maybe gathering at home,” Susi Lopez, a Spanish teacher at BHS, said.

Under the presidential administration, many Latinx people are skeptical about attending celebrations this year. “As the federal government attacks our community and abducts people through racial profiling across the nation, many Latine people are afraid of being targeted. Many Hispanic Heritage Month events were brought to more secure locations this year to ensure we can all celebrate safely,” Berkeley Council member Cecilia Lunaparra said, “To me, this highlights the resilience of our community and the importance of coming together to celebrate our beautiful and diverse cultures.” Lunaparra is Mexican American with a mixed ethnic background, with parents who immigrated to the United States in the 90s.

The presence of ICE goes even further than events like those during Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month. Raquel L’Esperance Feldman, a junior at BHS, said, “I feel like the detentions and raids go deeper than just the celebrations this month because more immigration enforcement has been stopping many other events. For example, I know that Bad Bunny didn’t even plan a tour in the U.S.” Bad Bunny, a prominent and popular Puerto Rican Latin music artist, didn’t put tour dates in the U.S. in fear that U.S. immigration authorities could raid his venues to target his fans.

As federal immigration policy shifts, many still question where they can feel safe in the U.S. Despite this, the Latinx/Hispanic community continues to celebrate and take pride in its rich culture. Multiple celebrations still took place, including El Grito de Delores on Monday, Sept. 15, 2025, at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco, and the Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025, King of the Streets Lowrider Parade and Festival in San Francisco. The Lowrider parade was extremely successful this year, bringing together many people of Latinx/Hispanic heritage. According to many, celebrations like these are what bring the community together. “(ICE is) not gonna stop me and my family from enjoying ourselves and finding community … that’s literally the only thing that’s going to help us,” Calvo said.",https://berkeleyhighjacket.com/assets/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-10-at-3.59.47-pm.png,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:20.700784

Community members lined the sidewalks outside neighborhood schools Friday afternoon in Lincoln Square, part of a rapid response mobilization following word of ICE activity in the area.

Federal agents reportedly detained two people, including an employee of WGN-TV, Friday morning at the busy intersection of Lincoln and Foster avenues.

The TV station said in a statement that it is “actively gathering the facts” related to the “evolving situation.” The employee involved is not a member of the news department, WGN added.

Ald. Matt Martin (47th Ward) notified his constituents via social media that ICE agents were in the area and encouraged them to help their neighbors: “Many of the locations ICE agents have been spotted at are schools — both public and private. If you’re able, please consider supporting safe pick ups at the school closest to you.”

Erin Tobes and Audra Wunder had already formed a mutual aid team for Chappell Elementary — located just blocks from where the incident occurred in the morning — and were able to muster a sizable group by the time students were dismissed from classes Friday. Adults were posted all along the school’s perimeter.

“People are dropping everything,” said Tobes. “We’re hoping ICE will see all these bodies, us showing up as a community.”

Similar groups have popped up at other schools, including nearby McPherson and Ravenswood elementary schools, and organizers are sharing resources and tactics, Wunder said.

“We’re all starting this out of necessity,” she said.

The response teams are equipped with whistles to warn of the presence of ICE agents, and groups like the one at Chappell are also helping families within the school’s community who might need rides to work or other assistance out of fear of detainment.

Though neighborhoods such as Pilsen and Little Village may have larger Latino populations, schools in Lincoln Square enroll anywhere from 25% to 42% Latino students.

In addition to providing safe passage for students and parents at pick-up and drop-off, Tobes said she hoped the community’s presence would deter any action by agents that could traumatize children.

“We want to maintain the safety and innocence of all the kids,” she said.

Silvia Hernandez, who was among the parents safeguarding Chappell and adjacent Amundsen High School, said her 8-year-old daughter isn’t so much scared as she is upset, and even spent last night making a video calling on people to just get along.

All the women agreed that while it was heartwarming to see the community sticking together and standing up for neighbors, the need to do so in the first place was heartbreaking.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.","More than three dozen federal judges have told The New York Times that the Supreme Court’s flurry of brief, opaque emergency orders in cases related to the Trump administration have left them confused about how to proceed in those matters and are hurting the judiciary’s image with the public.

At issue are the quick-turn orders the Supreme Court has issued dictating whether Trump administration policies should be left in place while they are litigated through the lower courts. That emergency docket, a growing part of the Supreme Court’s work in recent years, has taken on greater importance amid the flood of litigation challenging President Trump’s efforts to expand executive power.

While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical affects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending.

The striking and highly unusual critique of the nation’s highest court from lower court judges reveals the degree to which litigation over Mr. Trump’s agenda has created strains in the federal judicial system.

Sixty-five judges responded to a Times questionnaire sent to hundreds of federal judges across the country. Of those, 47 said the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Mr. Trump returned to office.

The judges responded to the questionnaire and spoke in interviews on the condition of anonymity so they could share their views candidly, as lower court judges are governed by a complex set of rules that include limitations on their public statements.

Of the judges who responded, 28 were nominated by Republican presidents, including 10 by Mr. Trump; 37 were nominated by Democrats. While those nominated by Democrats were more critical of the Supreme Court, judges nominated by presidents of both parties expressed concerns.

In interviews, federal judges called the Supreme Court’s emergency orders “mystical,” “overly blunt,” “incredibly demoralizing and troubling” and “a slap in the face to the district courts.” One judge compared their district’s current relationship with the Supreme Court to “a war zone.” Another said the courts were in the midst of a “judicial crisis.”

The responses to The Times serve as the most comprehensive picture to date about the extraordinary tensions within the judiciary, hints of which have begun to spill out publicly.

At a hearing in September, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said his court was “out here flailing” as it tried to apply vague emergency rulings from the Supreme Court that left judges “in limbo.” Ruling on a different case, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts noted that the emergency orders “have not been models of clarity.”

The Supreme Court has so far issued emergency orders in about 20 cases involving the Trump administration’s policies. In at least seven of those orders, the majority offered no reasoning for its decision.

At public events, some Supreme Court justices have defended their use of the emergency docket as a legitimate response to the increase in swift presidential policy-making by executive order, as opposed to legislation passed through Congress. Offering extensive reasoning or explanation, they argued, would risk locking the court into a position that might not turn out to be its final view.

A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment.

The Times reached out to more than 400 judges, including every judge in districts that have handled at least one legal challenge to a major piece of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Most of those who declined to participate did not give a reason. Others said they did not think it was their place to judge the work of the Supreme Court.

The judges who responded may not represent the views of the entire judiciary, but to have even several dozen judges out of the nation’s more than 1,000 district, appellate and senior judges express such concern about the Supreme Court’s behavior is highly unusual.

Forty-two judges went so far as to say that the Supreme Court’s emergency orders had caused “some” or “major” harm to the public’s perception of the judiciary. Among those who responded to the question, nearly half of the Republican-nominated judges said they believed the orders had harmed the judiciary’s standing in the public eye.

Twelve judges who responded to the questionnaire said they believed the Supreme Court had handled its emergency docket appropriately. But only two said public perception of judges had improved as a result of how the Supreme Court had handled its recent work.

The code of conduct for federal judges requires them to act in ways that promote “public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” They seldom comment on public controversies and almost never share their views of Supreme Court jurisprudence, outside of the carefully chosen words of their written opinions.

Judge Luttig is a critic of the Trump administration’s interpretation of the Constitution who is in frequent contact with sitting judges from across the political spectrum. He said he believed the views expressed to The Times were broadly representative of the lower courts as a whole.

“I can’t think of words to capture the significance that federal judges themselves have to speak out,” he said, “because the Supreme Court has given them no choice but to speak out.”

‘An Atmosphere of Disrespect’

The emergency docket is known to its critics as the shadow docket, and its rise as a flashpoint for tensions in the judiciary coincides with the Supreme Court’s increasing use of it in ways that have benefited Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Time and time again, district court judges have imposed blocks on expansive policies issued by Mr. Trump’s administration, rulings that have been upheld by the appeals courts, only to have the Supreme Court remove them with an emergency order. Mr. Trump has benefited from nearly all of the Supreme Court’s rulings on emergency applications since his return to office.

For now, his administration can withhold some forms of congressionally appropriated funds, send undocumented immigrants to dangerous places such as South Sudan and use race as a criterion in making immigration stops, all because of emergency orders.

Some of the judges who responded to the Times questionnaire expressed concerns with the substance of the Supreme Court’s orders, fearing critics would see partisanship in the justices’ consistent siding with the president over lower court judges. Similar views have been aired in dissents from the Supreme Court’s liberal wing, which have called pro-Trump rulings by the majority “misguided,” “dangerous” and an “existential threat to the rule of law.”

For Mr. Trump’s allies, lower court judges are the ones who exceeded their authority in blocking presidential actions, interfering with what they claim is a popular mandate. That view was shared by one judge, a Trump appointee, who praised the Supreme Court for “flushing out anti-democratic rulings” with its emergency orders.

The main complaint voiced by a majority of the judges was not where the Supreme Court was coming down, but how it was doing so. By presenting its emergency orders in just a few sentences, with little or no reasoning, judges said the Supreme Court was leaving them without a clear path to assess what the justices were thinking.

The result, one judge said, was that the court was expecting their district court colleagues “to read their minds about what their view of the law is.”

Despite the justices’ brevity and lack of reasoning, the Supreme Court has become more insistent that its emergency orders are supposed to serve as guideposts for the lower courts. In an unsigned emergency order from July, the Supreme Court noted that while emergency orders were “not conclusive,” district court judges should still consider them in “like cases.”

Some justices have gone further, using their opinions to publicly admonish judges who, in their view, are failing to correctly apply the court’s emergency orders. In August, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh took to task Judge William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for what they saw as a failure to apply an emergency ruling in one spending case to another. “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” the justices wrote.

In response, Judge Young issued a rare apology from the bench, though he expressed some bewilderment with the court’s opacity.

“Never, before this admonition, has any judge in any higher court ever thought to suggest that this court had defied the precedent of a higher court — that was never my intention,” he said.

Several judges singled out the justices’ criticism of Judge Young, an 85-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan and an Army veteran who has sat for more than 40 years, as a particularly demoralizing breach of decorum.

That view resonated with one of their retired colleagues, Jeremy Fogel, who was a federal judge for 20 years. Judge Young, he said, “has been at it for so long. He’s done the toughest cases, and he’s done them well. For a guy like that to get bench-slapped for not reading the tea leaves properly? That’s just not fair.”

Justice Gorsuch’s opinion could be read as “promoting a disrespect for the judiciary,” one that echoed Mr. Trump’s rhetorical attacks on judges, said Nancy Gertner, a retired judge who teaches at Harvard Law School. Both, she said, “undermine the bench and promote an atmosphere of disrespect.”

The Lower Courts Speak Out

Responses to the questionnaire were overwhelmingly critical of the Supreme Court, but they were not unanimous. Twenty-one judges either declined to answer the question about the effect of emergency orders on the public’s perception of the judiciary or said they believed they have had little or no effect.

A few judges were more equivocal about emergency orders, views that were echoed by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a widely respected jurist and Reagan nominee who wrote a robust defense of the role that district courts play in the constitutional scheme. In an interview, Judge Wilkinson noted that the Supreme Court was largely at the mercy of circumstances beyond its control: a high volume of emergency challenges to a presidency that “would put its foot on the pedal, because it has an agenda, and it’s sensitive to the fact that electoral mandates are perishable.”

While noting that the emergency docket had its advantages in terms of quickly and uniformly managing a mushrooming caseload from the executive branch, Judge Wilkinson said there were good arguments for the Supreme Court to be careful about using it too much.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days.","National Review, September 11, 2025

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a district-court injunction that blocked federal agents from making immigration stops based on certain demographic characteristics. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that location, occupation, language, and ethnicity – taken individually or in combination — are not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that someone is an illegal alien. But as Justice Kavanaugh explained in staying Judge Frimpong’s order, circumstances on the ground make reliance on such factors entirely reasonable:

Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.

Having recently published a report on the illegal immigrant share of workers in each Census-identified occupation, I can bolster Kavanaugh’s point with some numbers. Let’s take the example of landscaping mentioned above. As of the 2019-2023 period that the data set covers, about 17 percent of all “landscaping and groundskeeping workers” in the U.S. were illegal immigrants. Put another way, a randomly-selected landscaping worker has a 17 percent chance of being illegal. That’s already a fairly high percentage without adding any additional information.

But of course, we can add more. This case focused on enforcement operations in Los Angeles. A landscaping worker in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a 30 percent chance of being illegal. Furthermore, a i>Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles has a 33 percent chance. Finally, a Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles who speaks English less than very well has a remarkable 42 percent chance of being illegal.

This exercise can be repeated for other immigrant-heavy occupations. For example, about 21 percent of all construction laborers in the U.S. were illegal in the 2019–2023 period. Adding the factors of Los Angeles, Hispanic ethnicity, and low English ability increases that percentage all the way to 52 percent.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days. However, if a law enforcement officer encounters a suspect who has about a 50–50 chance of having committed the violation that the officer is investigating, then common sense suggests that a stop is justified.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/logo-facebook.png,N,,2025-10-11 07:57:18.046610

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.","A federal judge expressed frustration with Justice Department lawyers at a marathon hearing Friday as she weighed the Trump administration’s efforts to send to Africa Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man previously deported to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia is back in the United States in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, but he remains protected from deportation to his home country.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis is weighing arguments from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers that the administration is illegally punishing their client by floating various African countries that won’t accept him rather than oblige his demand to be removed to Costa Rica instead.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argue the judge should release their client. The judge will issue a ruling in writing later.

“They have spun the globe and picked various places they can identify, whether it’s to troll him for political purposes, essentially to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego Garcia,” attorney Andrew Rossman said.

In August, the government signaled it would remove Abrego Garcia to Uganda. After he expressed claims of fear, he was notified last month the government was looking to send him to the small, landlocked African country of Eswatini.

It led Xinis to demand the Trump administration bring to her Greenbelt, Md., courtroom Friday a witness with personal knowledge of the steps being taken so she can better assess the situation.

The government chose John Schultz, who has worked at Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more than two decades and oversees removal operations in Africa and other regions.

During roughly four hours of testimony, Schultz revealed that the ask for Eswatini to accept Abrego Garcia did not take place until this past Wednesday evening. Schultz said the country declined, but “discussions are ongoing.”

“The final decision is made when the manifest is sent over, and no cases have been denied after a manifest has been sent over,” Schultz said.

After Uganda and Eswatini, Abrego Garcia recently received notice the government was intending to deport him to Ghana, but Ghana’s foreign minister hours before the hearing made clear on social media the country “is not accepting Abrego Garcia.”

Schultz testified the notice was “prematurely sent.”

His testimony left Xinis frustrated. She told Justice Department lawyers afterward they had “ignored” her order by choosing a witness who knew “less than nothing” about Abrego Garcia’s request to be sent to Costa Rica.

“If the government has not done anything to effectuate the one place he says he’ll go and the one place they say will take him, how can I find you’re really pursuing this?” Xinis quipped.

The Justice Department points to Abrego Garcia’s previous suggestion he feared persecution in more than 20 countries, which included Costa Rica.

“That is still potentially a live issue, although I’ll acknowledge the clarity given in court today could change the analysis,” Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign told the judge.

Xinis, an appointee of former President Obama, has temporarily blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation until she figures out next steps.

Schultz expressed confidence Abrego Garcia would be deported in as soon as 72 hours if the judge lifts her ruling and Eswatini agrees to take him.

“We could remove him very quickly,” Schultz testified.

Abrego Garcia’s case has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown. His administration accuses Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, an allegation he denies.

A Salvadoran national, Abrego Garcia entered the United States illegally and lived in Maryland for years. He garnered national attention after the Trump administration in March deported him to a megaprison in El Salvador, despite an immigration order protecting him from being removed there over fears he’d face persecution.

In June, the government flew Abrego Garcia from El Salvador to Tennessee to face felony human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.

They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""
The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities.
""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios.","A new joint report from Harvard University and Physicians for Human Rights says U.S. immigration detention facilities are ""systematically torturing"" detainees through the prolonged use of solitary confinement — often for weeks at a time — in what the United Nations defines as psychological torture.

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report. Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" including individuals with mental health conditions, spent an average of 38 days in isolation during the first quarter of 2025 — nearly triple the 14-day average recorded in 2021.

Researchers say the findings, based on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, point to a worsening trend since late 2024, with the practice now used routinely and without clear oversight. ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" said Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, to Axios. ""This violates both U.S. and international law.""

ICE guidelines limit solitary confinement for people with mental health issues to exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, but the report found the policy is routinely violated. In many cases, isolation was used for minor infractions, such as refusing medical procedures or protesting detention conditions.

The report's authors concluded that solitary confinement in immigration detention ""has no place in a civil system,"" arguing that ICE's growing use of the practice transforms administrative custody into a punitive system operating without due process. They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""

The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities. It also urges states and local governments to ban or restrict the practice in facilities that contract with ICE, conduct unannounced inspections, and ensure detainees have access to legal representation and interpreters.

""ICE cannot be presently trusted to account accurately, let alone implement humane policies in its existing facilities,"" the report said. ""Although transparency, accountability, and oversight are essential first steps, ICE must focus its attention on abolishing the inhumane practice of solitary confinement and immediately releasing vulnerable populations from immigration detention.""

The new report builds on earlier investigations showing that solitary placements in ICE custody rose 41% between December 2024 and August 2025, peaking at more than 1,100 individuals. Some detainees reported being held in windowless cells for weeks, denied medical care, or isolated after filing abuse complaints — despite DHS policy prohibiting segregation as retaliation.

""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios. ""And these are not criminals — they are asylum seekers and immigrants.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583579/solitary-confinement.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 05:59:19.218263

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.","As the government shutdown stretches into its second week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not working — and more are not getting paid. The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.

Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.

""I'm feeling energized, honestly,"" says Gorman. ""It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.""

Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.

Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.

Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.

Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.

""To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,"" she says.

""I'm done being afraid""

Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.

Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?

""I'm done being afraid of them,"" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. ""They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.""

NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: ""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""

Connecting with others for support and information

Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.

""They have made us much, much stronger,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.

Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.

""I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,"" she says.

Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.

""I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,"" she says. ""It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.""

With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.

Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.

Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.

""This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.

""I believe very strongly that my job as a civil servant is to carry out the lawful instructions of the sitting administration, regardless of whether I think it's a good policy,"" she says. ""That's my job, and I did it under the first Trump administration.""

But this time, she believes the administration is acting lawlessly, including by sidelining the unions.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2999x1687+1+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fb3%2F669b2b3d494eae8b0c9dde6077bc%2Fmonica-sarah-fed-shutdown.png,N,,2025-10-11 05:59:12.059158

“These ICE raids are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act, when the U.S. Marshals would hunt down and kidnap Black Americans,” Bynum said in a statement. “That was a dark and shameful time in our nation’s history—we must not allow that to repeat. Masked federal agents aren’t welcome in our state and they can’t keep kidnapping Americans.”

Frank Miranda, 46, filmed ICE agents confronting him(link is external) before work on Oct. 2, demanding that he answer questions about where he was born. When he refused, agents threatened him with a dog and took him to the ICE facility on South Macadam Avenue.

Bynum demanded a “thorough investigation” into Miranda’s abduction.

WW was first to report the incident on Tuesday and asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment. An ICE spokesperson returned the message today, impugning the paper’s motives and journalistic standards.

“ICE officers do not abduct people. Full Stop,” an unnamed spokesperson said in an email. “To suggest they do is what is leading to the 100% increase in assaults on our officers. A responsible journalist would not advocate for violence and instead would seek truth over clicks so it’s clear the Willamette Week is only interested in fueling the fire rather than seeking to tone down the rhetoric.""

Miranda “was handed to ICE Oct. 2 to determine his alienage and removability,” the spokesperson said. “He was eventually released the same day as arrest.”

Portland lawyer Michael Fuller described Miranda’s ordeal in a letter(link is external) to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday, flagging his client’s intention to seek damages.

Asked about ICE’s response today, Fuller wrote in an email: “As Trump himself said, anonymous sources are bullshit. The fact that ICE won’t attribute its comment to an actual person speaks to the baseless nature of its statement. The abduction video speaks for itself.”

Noem visited Portland on Tuesday, where she joined officials on the roof of the ICE building and watched a small group of protesters(link is external), including a man in a chicken suit, stand along the road. She called them “uneducated and ill-informed.”

“Not only do these raids undermine the principles that our country was founded on, but they’re against the law and downright racist,” Bynum wrote. “I’m demanding an end to ICE’s reign of terror, a thorough investigation into the kidnapping of Mr. Miranda, and fundamental change to this administration’s approach to immigration.”",http://bynum.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bynum.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/bynum_bc_045_020525.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 08:57:04.909691

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged arrest detainers against two criminal illegal aliens from Honduras for their involvement in a highway shooting in Virginia along I-295 on October 5, 2025.

Police were alerted of shots fired around 5 p.m. when a 911 caller reported possible gunfire along Interstate 295 northbound near the Creighton Road exit at mile marker 34.

A Hanover County Sheriff's deputy who was conducting a nearby traffic stop on the interstate observed a silver BMW matching the suspect description traveling northbound on I-295. When the deputy pulled onto the interstate, the BMW sped off, prompting a police pursuit. The Virginia State Police were called to assist with the investigation.

The two 17-year-olds were arrested. According to public records, the criminal illegal aliens have been charged with shooting from a vehicle, possession of a firearm under age 18, possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, and reckless handling of a firearm.

ICE officers lodged arrest detainers with the Merrimac Juvenile Detention Center in Williamsburg, where the pair is currently being held in custody.

“These criminal illegal alien thugs whipped around in their BMW with complete neglect for the safety of Virginians when they decided to open fire on an interstate highway,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These illegal aliens were released unvetted by the Biden Administration into our country. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure these public safety threats are not released back onto Virginia’s roads. We are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens.”

""Senate Democrats dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of US troops.""","Senate Democrats are blasting President Donald Trump's increasingly authoritarian behavior and congressional Republicans for shutting down the US government to preserve devastating healthcare cuts, but over half of them voted with the GOP late Thursday to give nearly $1 trillion to the Pentagon, which has never passed an audit.

The final vote on the Senate's $925 billion version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 was 77-20, with Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) not voting. The passage tees up talks with leaders in the House of Representatives, where nearly all Republicans and 17 Democrats approved an NDAA last month.

Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Cory Booker (NJ), Maria Cantwell (Wash.) Tammy Duckworth (Ill.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), Andy Kim (NJ), Ed Markey (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Chris Murphy (Conn.), Patty Murray (Wash.), Alex Padilla (Calif.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Adam Schiff (Calif.), Tina Smith (Minn.) Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Peter Welch (Vt.), and Ron Wyden (Ore.) opposed the bill alongside Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who caucuses with Democrats, and Rand Paul (R-Ky).

""Yesterday, the Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government,"" Markey said in a Friday statement. ""All the while, they are stealing healthcare from American families to fund tax breaks for CEO billionaires. This isn't a budget that funds America's real security needs.""

""The Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government.""

""Republicans rail that we need to cut government spending—for food assistance, for healthcare, for environmental protection—yet they are showering their defense contractor cronies with hundreds of billions for wasteful and destabilizing programs like Trump's Golden Dome space-based missile system,"" Markey continued. ""Yet they decry that funding will soon dry up for paying military salaries and for essential nuclear security operations at the National Nuclear Security Administration.""

""In their desperation to score cheap political points, Republicans are undermining vital national security missions,"" he added. ""Year after year, Congress continues to expand military spending while denying investments in the programs that will truly build a safer, healthier future for working- and middle-class families. The cost of passing this bill in the form of denied rights and wasteful spending is simply too great.""

In posts on Bluesky, journalist Erin Reed called out the Senate Democrats who helped pass the bill, given its attacks on LGBTQ+ Americans and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)—common targets of congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.

""In 2024, the NDAA became the vehicle for one of the most consequential betrayals of transgender Americans by national Democrats in recent memory, after Democrats allowed provisions targeting trans military family members and dependents to stand when they had control of the Senate and White House,"" Reed noted.

""This year, history is repeating itself,"" she said. ""Senate Democrats dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of US troops.""

Early Thursday afternoon, Duckworth, a veteran herself, said that she was blocking the NDAA until she secured a hearing to investigate the president's ""gross abuse of our military"" by sending soldiers into American cities. A few hours later—shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in her state, Illinois—Duckworth announced that a hearing is planned.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), one of the Democrats who voted for the NDAA, secured sufficient bipartisan support for his amendment to end the authorizations for use of military force related to the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Washington Post reported that ""the House bill also includes a similar measure, bringing Congress to the precipice of repealing the laws.""

Some other Democrat-proposed amendments weren't successful. According to The Hill:

Amendments that failed to pass included one from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who had hoped to block money for President Trump to retrofit a luxury Qatari jet he accepted as an intended replacement for Air Force One.

""Retrofitting this foreign-owned luxury jet to make it fully operational will cost hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. That's money that shouldn't be wasted,"" Schumer said.

Still, Schumer ultimately voted for the NDAA—unlike Van Hollen, who proposed blocking Trump and governors from sending National Guard troops to another state if its governor or local leaders don't agree.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61737806&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C497%2C0%2C498,N,,2025-10-10 23:56:48.186191

Among three who completed speech assessments, all showed significant improvement with one able to identify one- and two-syllable words with no visual cues and respond to distant sounds and speech in noisy environments

Latest DB-OTO data presented at AAO-HNSF; U.S. regulatory submission planned later this year, pending discussions with the FDA

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced updated data for their investigational gene therapy DB-OTO for profound genetic hearing loss due to variants of the otoferlin ( OTOF ) gene were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented during an oral presentation at the annual American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNSF) meeting. These latest results from the pivotal CHORD trial show 11 out of 12 participants have experienced clinically meaningful hearing improvements, including 3 who achieved normal hearing levels. Additionally, eight participants with longer follow-up showed stability or continued improvement in their hearing, and among three who completed speech assessments, all showed significant improvement.

“Until now, genetic OTOF -related hearing loss was considered permanent, which is why many of us have dedicated our careers to this field,” said Lawrence R. Lustig, M.D., Chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a trial investigator. “This registrational data set showcases consistent, rapid and robust responses to DB-OTO, and for those followed to later timepoints, we’ve seen hearing stability as well as continued improvement in understanding of speech. These results are even more poignant when viewed by the families – as one of the parents said, their situation is now ‘unimaginable’ from one year ago. This truly represents a new era in the treatment of hearing loss.”

The CHORD trial evaluated pediatric participants with profound hearing loss due to variants of the OTOF gene that received a single administration of DB-OTO via intracochlear infusion. Among 12 participants (aged 10 months to 16 years), nine received the gene therapy unilaterally (in one ear) and three received it bilaterally (in both ears). The surgical procedure to administer DB-OTO leverages an approach similar to cochlear implantation, which enables use in young infants.

Nearly all participants (11 of 12; 14 of 15 treated ears) demonstrated improved hearing, responding within weeks of treatment. As published and presented, the trial met the primary endpoint with 9 participants experiencing hearing improvements at a threshold of ≤70 decibel hearing level (dBHL) as assessed by behavioral pure tone audiometry (PTA) at week 24. This threshold corresponds to a clinical standard that typically does not require cochlear implantation and enables natural acoustic hearing. Notably, 6 could hear soft speech without assistive devices, and 3 were further able to detect whispers (achieving normal hearing sensitivity). One participant who did not meet the primary PTA endpoint at week 24 further improved to achieve “nearly normal” hearing sensitivity at week 48. Nine participants also demonstrated an auditory brainstem response (ABR) at ≤90 decibels (dB), achieving the trial’s key secondary endpoint.

Hearing improvements remained stable or continued to improve in 8 participants who had follow-up visits of ≥36 weeks (up to 72 weeks). Speech development was also assessed in the 3 participants who were followed at least 48 weeks and all showed significant improvements. One of these participants demonstrated the ability to identify one- and two-syllable words with no visual cues and could respond to distant sounds and speech in noisy environments.

Across all 12 participants, both the surgical procedure and DB-OTO were well tolerated, and there were no DB-OTO-related adverse findings reported. Two participants experienced serious adverse events: one was attributed to a cochlear implant surgical complication and the other to a recent vaccination. Some participants experienced transient post-surgical vestibular adverse events (e.g., nystagmus, nausea, dizziness, vomiting), all of which fully resolved.

The U.S. regulatory application for DB-OTO is planned for later this year, pending discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DB-OTO received Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designations from the FDA. The European Medicines Agency also granted Orphan Drug Designation.

The potential use of DB-OTO for OTOF -related hearing loss is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About OTOF -related Hearing Loss

Permanent congenital hearing loss (present at birth) is a significant unmet medical need that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born in the U.S. and approximately half of these cases have genetic causes. Notably, otoferlin-related hearing loss is ultra-rare, affecting 20-50 newborns per year in the U.S. This specific condition is caused by variants in the OTOF gene, which lead to a lack of a functional otoferlin protein that is critical for the communication between the sensory cells of the inner ear and the auditory nerve.

About the CHORD Trial

The CHORD trial is a registrational Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DB-OTO in infants, children and adolescents with OTOF- related hearing loss. The trial is currently enrolling children (<18 years of age) across sites in the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.

CHORD is being conducted in two parts. In the initial dose-escalation cohort (Part A), participants receive a single intracochlear infusion of DB-OTO in one ear. In the expansion cohort (Part B), participants receive DB-OTO in both ears at the selected dose from Part A.

Hearing improvements were assessed by PTA and ABR. PTA is the gold standard measurement of hearing sensitivity and is measured through behavioral responses to sound (e.g., turning head towards sound) that is emitted at different intensity levels and measured in dB. ABR corroborates these behavioral responses, serving as an objective confirmation of hearing function, and is measured through recording electrical brainstem responses to sound emitted at different intensity levels measured in dBs. At baseline, all participants had profound hearing loss (behavioral PTA), and no electrophysiological (ABR) responses at maximum sound levels.

Additional information about the trial, including enrollment, can be obtained by contacting clinicaltrials@regeneron.com .

About DB-OTO and the Regeneron Auditory Program

DB-OTO is an investigational cell-selective, dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by variants of the OTOF gene. The treatment aims to deliver a working copy of the OTOF gene to replace the non-functional otoferlin protein using a modified, non-pathogenic virus that is delivered via an infusion into the cochlea under general anesthesia (similar to the procedure used for cochlear implantation). In this gene therapy, the newly introduced OTOF gene is under the control of a proprietary cell-specific Myo15 promoter, which is intended to restrict expression only to hair cells that normally express otoferlin.

In addition to OTOF , Regeneron is committed to investigating several other targets for genetic forms of hearing loss.

“We’re purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of,” Noem said to President Trump during the meeting. “We’re going to not back off. In fact, we’re doubling down and we’re going to be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

“I was there a few days ago and looked at some facilities that we can deploy more law enforcement out of,” Noem said. “Because what they’re trying to do with these riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those murderers and rapists that are out on the streets.”

While Noem did not specify which buildings will be bought by the administration, she told ICE officials and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents at the immigration processing facility in Broadview, Ill., on Friday, “We’re going to try to buy that building today,” while pointing at a building nearby, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The Hill has reached out to DHS for comment.

Trump recently directed around 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and 400 federalized Texas National Guard members to be sent to Chicago, Portland, Ore., and possibly other cities across the country “where needed,” according to a memorandum filed Sunday in Oregon’s lawsuit. But U.S. District Judge April Perry on Thursday blocked the president from federalizing National Guard members across Illinois. Perry’s temporary restraining order ends on Oct. 23.

TOP TALKER

IN A SLAP to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a federal judge in Chicago has temporarily halted plans to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois. The move stalls a key part of the president’s effort to boost federal presence in so-called sanctuary states.

U.S. District Judge April Perry issued the restraining order Thursday, casting doubt on the administration’s claims of unrest in Chicago. She described the narrative of violence as exaggerated and pointed to the use of tear gas and military-style tactics against “mostly peaceful demonstrators” — a group she noted was never more than a few hundred strong.

It’s a legal blow for Trump, who’s leaned hard into law-and-order messaging, especially in cities that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Chicago and nearby Broadview — home to a major ICE facility — have been front and center in the administration’s push.

Within hours of the TRO, the Trump administration filed notice of appeal in the Seventh Circuit.

In Oregon, meanwhile, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — which covers Oregon and other western states — signaled it was likely to rule in Trump’s favor on his deployment of the guard in Portland. Our story is here.

From the bench in Chicago: Perry, a Biden appointee, warned that National Guard troops lack the law-enforcement training to handle civil protests and could make things worse. “They’re not trained in de-escalation,” she said.

At the center of the case is Trump’s claim that Illinois is in “rebellion” — a legal basis to justify the deployment. Perry didn’t buy it and pressed the administration’s attorney repeatedly on that point.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, who led the legal challenge, called the ruling a “victory for the rule of law,” saying the court recognized the administration’s lack of “credibility.”

The Illinois ruling drew praise from Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have accused Trump of using public safety as cover to go after political opponents.

Pritzker said the ruling shows “Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law,” according to a post.

And Johnson made clear: “The Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger.”

For the administration: Attorney Eric Hamilton defended the National Guard plans, citing the “urgent need” to protect federal agents and property tied to immigration enforcement.

After the ruling, he asked Perry to confirm that the order only blocks deployments in Illinois — she agreed.

The drama isn’t over. The TRO is for 14 days, and the Trump appeal will be on a fast track. Perry’s full written opinion will be released today.

THE BUZZ

SPRINGFIELD MOVES: Thursday’s court ruling addressed the National Guard, but Illinois Senate President Don Harmon says state lawmakers are examining how to address the federal immigration enforcement actions that are continuing in Illinois communities.

“People are on edge,” Harmon said in an interview ahead of next week’s legislative session. He cited masked individuals with no identification and driving unmarked cars as they detain people.

“I don’t know what tools we have to try to prevent that, but I’m damn well willing to try because that’s wrong,” Harmon said.

Although no specific bill has been filed yet, Harmon said the caucus is exploring options that could set legal boundaries for how and when federal immigration authorities can operate in Illinois, particularly in coordination with local or state agencies.

The challenge: “The system was not designed for the state to police a federal government. And a federal government assaulting an American state or an American city is just beyond the pale, so we are clearly in uncharted waters,” Harmon said.

Any ICE-related legislation could face legal scrutiny and political opposition, but Harmon said that’s not a reason to shy away.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country.
Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica.
“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said.
Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts.","Abrego is originally from El Salvador. He entered the U.S. illegally and lived in Maryland for more than a decade before he was arrested in March and deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison. Courts declared that deportation illegal because it violated a 2019 order from an immigration judge who barred the U.S. from sending him there due to potential persecution by a local gang.

The Trump administration returned Abrego to the U.S. in June under court order. Federal prosecutors simultaneously charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee — charges Abrego denies.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country. But Abrego’s lawyers argued during Friday’s hearing that the administration is dragging its feet in those deportation efforts in order to keep Abrego in immigration jail and pressure him to plead guilty.

The meager and unsuccessful deportation efforts could lead to Abrego being released from immigration detention within days, if U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis concludes the government hasn’t shown it’s making a sincere and substantial effort to find a destination for Abrego.

Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica. One of his lawyers, Andrew Rossman, said Friday that the administration’s scattershot attempts to identify African countries instead show that the administration is intent on refusing the Costa Rica offer.

“We now know they are 0 for 3. Three strikes and you’re out. They have spun the globe and picked various places … to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego,” Rossman told Xinis. “What we’ve been getting in this courtroom is a lot of run-around.”

The appearance that arrangements for Abrego’s deportation were being intentionally or unintentionally fumbled by the administration was underscored by the testimony of Immigration and Customs Enforcement official John Schultz, who said lower-level personnel at his agency erred by formally notifying Abrego Thursday that the U.S. government intended to send him to Ghana.

“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said. “I believe the field office was just trying to get ahead of things so that, if Ghana did say yes, removal would be quicker.”

Xinis held the daylong hearing in connection with a lawsuit Abrego filed seeking his release from immigration detention. She ordered the government to produce one or more witnesses Friday with “first-hand knowledge” about the administration’s efforts to find a country to send Abrego to.

Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts. He said the State Department reported that officials in Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, “said no initially” when they were asked just this week to accept Abrego. But, he said, discussions are ongoing.

“I don’t know if there’s a rank structure on the next country if Eswatini doesn’t work,” Schultz said.

Schultz also appeared to confirm the White House’s involvement in selecting countries Abrego might be sent to. He said an official at the Homeland Security Council, Matt Ochoa, told him that Uganda was a place the administration wanted to send Abrego to, but that eventually fell through. Justice Department attorneys cut short that questioning with an executive privilege claim.

However, Schultz acknowledged he’d had no significant involvement in the Abrego matter before this week and said he was entirely unaware of discussions about sending Abrego to Costa Rica. That irritated the judge, who complained that aspects of her order were “ignored” by the government.

“You come today with a witness who knows nothing about Costa Rica — I mean, less than nothing,” said Xinis, an Obama appointee. “That seems to be in contravention of this order.”

Under a 2001 Supreme Court case, immigrants can’t typically be detained for more than six months unless their deportation is reasonably foreseeable.

Abrego’s lawyers and the government disagree about when that six-month clock started. His attorneys say it was back in 2019 when Abrego was ordered deported by an immigration judge, albeit with the caveat he could not be sent to El Salvador. The Justice Department contends the clock didn’t begin running until August.

Rossman argued that the time Abrego spent in prison in El Salvador from March to June should count as immigration detention, but regardless of the calculation the government failed to show it was making sincere efforts to find a country to take Abrego. The attorney said the administration is holding him “for political purposes” and to avoid going back on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s vow that Abrego will never walk the streets of America again.

During a separate court session Friday in Nashville, the judge presiding over Abrego’s criminal case set a hearing for Nov. 3 to take evidence and possibly testimony about whether the charges should be dismissed on the grounds that the Trump administration instituted them to lash back at Abrego for defeating the government in court over his illegal deportation.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F77%2Fad%2Fb8f009754aa090f4357389826bc1%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2231303351,N,,2025-10-10 21:57:15.263226
